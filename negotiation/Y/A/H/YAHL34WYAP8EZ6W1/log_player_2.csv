# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting a significant discount:** You're buying the product for $250,000 less than John's offer and $150,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests she's unlikely to go much lower. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  You might push too hard and lose the deal, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
