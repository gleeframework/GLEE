The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she is offering it for $1,100,000. This means she is willing to accept a lower price than its value to her.  This suggests there's room for negotiation. It's better to try to get a lower price before going with John."

The price is getting close to my limit.  Alice is clearly trying to get a better price, but I'm not sure I can get her down further. At this point, it's safer to go with John and guarantee a purchase at a price I'm comfortable with."
