"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell my [product name]. I've had a lot of interest in it and I think it could really benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product truly brings a lot of value, and I believe this is a fair price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While it does sound valuable, $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,500 is too low. Could you meet me at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $15,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $13,000. Would you be open to $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  How about we make this our final price: $14,000. This offer reflects my absolute bottom line.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I can't quite meet that price.  My final offer is $12,250.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",12250.0,Bob,8,
