"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm happy to consider buying at $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  I'm still a bit high at $900,000. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
