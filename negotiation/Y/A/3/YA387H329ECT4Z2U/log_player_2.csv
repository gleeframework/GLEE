Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is close to my desired price point of $850,000.  While I'd prefer to get it for lower, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept it."
