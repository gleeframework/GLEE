"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to get the product for the lowest possible price.  $12,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the product's value to Bob.
* **Staying within budget:**  This offer is well within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Room for compromise:** There's still room for Alice to counteroffer, allowing for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair price:** $13,000 is a reasonable price for Bob, considering the product's value to him and the potential for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding risk:**  While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers or that Bob might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price.

By accepting this offer, Bob gets a good deal while minimizing risk and potentially saving time."
