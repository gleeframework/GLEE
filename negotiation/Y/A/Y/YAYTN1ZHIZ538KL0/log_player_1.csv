Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that price as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 9,500}

I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and willing to pay a premium for it. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still above the minimum value of the product to me. I'll think carefully about my next move.

Since Bob's offer is close to the minimum value of the product to me, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price. Maybe I can get closer to my initial offer of $9,500."
