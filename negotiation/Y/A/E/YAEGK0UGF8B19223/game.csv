"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $950000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $975000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to get a reasonable return.  I believe this is a win-win scenario. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this.",975000.0,Alice,3,
