"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but to make this work, I'd need to be closer to $1,050,000. Would that be possible?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
