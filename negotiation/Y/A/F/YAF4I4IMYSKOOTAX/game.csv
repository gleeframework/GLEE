"Thank you for considering my offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we aim for a compromise? I am willing to lower the price to $1,400,000. This still allows us to both benefit from the transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
