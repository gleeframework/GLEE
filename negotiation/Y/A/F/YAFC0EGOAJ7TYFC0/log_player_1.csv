Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense value"" and ""exclusive opportunity,"" you create a perception of high demand and desirability, justifying the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" subtly implies there's room for discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to capitalize on the product's value to both you and Bob while leaving you with a comfortable profit margin even if you need to lower the price during negotiation."
