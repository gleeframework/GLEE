Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $10,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired amount."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,750 is getting close to what I want, but I believe I can still push for a bit more.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close, but I'm running out of rounds. Bob's offer of $11,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, and it's not worth risking another round and potentially losing the deal altogether.  John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, so I'm going to take his offer and sell to him."
