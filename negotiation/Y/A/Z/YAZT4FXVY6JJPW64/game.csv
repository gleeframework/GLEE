"Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, so I hope we can find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $2,300,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your position. To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,900,000. This offer takes our respective positions into account and moves us closer to a deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I recognize your revised offer and am willing to come down slightly.  How about we settle on $1,700,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. My absolute maximum is $1,300,000. If we can't agree on a price closer to this, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
