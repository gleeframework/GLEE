"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $13500?  Let's meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",12500.0,Bob,4,
