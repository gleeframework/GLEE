"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher. Rejecting his offer gives me a chance to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price to $120, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to compromise. This might encourage him to raise his offer closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, it's risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance he might not budge further, and I could end up with nothing or having to sell to John for $100. Accepting his offer ensures I at least get $110, which is better than potentially ending up with nothing."
