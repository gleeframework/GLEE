Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a great price for a product worth a lot to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000** is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. 
* This leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring you make a profit.
* The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob. 
* By offering a price lower than your reserve price, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy relies on the assumption that Bob is motivated to buy the product and is willing to negotiate. It's also important to factor in the potential cost of negotiating with Bob versus the certainty of selling to John."
