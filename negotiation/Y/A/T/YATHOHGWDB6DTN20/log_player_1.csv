Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
