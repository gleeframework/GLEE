"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget. I believe this price allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product, which is a substantial amount and reflects the value I place on it. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900,000.  However, I'm still hoping to reach a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer the product to you for $925,000. This price is a fair middle ground and allows us both to walk away satisfied. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
