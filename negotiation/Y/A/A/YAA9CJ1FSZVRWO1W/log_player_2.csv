Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000.** You want to save as much money as possible. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice is willing to sell for $1,400,000, which means she has room to lower the price further.
* **You have a backup option.**  John is offering the product for $1,500,000, so you're not locked into accepting anything above that.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
