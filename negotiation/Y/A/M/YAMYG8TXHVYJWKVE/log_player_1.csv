"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still ensuring a good profit. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by highlighting the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly but staying above my minimum threshold. I'm also emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product to encourage him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm open to negotiation, $95 is still below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I can't go any lower than $100, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested at that price."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
I'm holding firm at my minimum, but I'm keeping the door open for a deal. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to buying from John at $120, but I'm still interested in the product from you. Can you meet me at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and he's clearly close to buying from John. This means I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely. Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit, even though it's less than I originally hoped for."
