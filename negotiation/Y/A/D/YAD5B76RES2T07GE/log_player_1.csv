"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a higher price. I want to see if I can negotiate further with him.  $10,500 is still below my minimum, and I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  I can't go as low as $10,500, but I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This is a fair price considering the value and the benefits you'll get from the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $10,200 is still below what I'm aiming for. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before I consider selling to John. There are still rounds left and I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,200 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs while giving you a great deal.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
