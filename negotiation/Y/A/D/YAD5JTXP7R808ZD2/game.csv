"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? I'm willing to be flexible to reach a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $9500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your asking price and within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $9500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to go down to $10250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your original price, but $10250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's seal the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
