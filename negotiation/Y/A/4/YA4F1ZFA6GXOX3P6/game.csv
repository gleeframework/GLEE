"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price,  $900000 is significantly below its actual value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This price still reflects the product's unique benefits and potential.  I believe it's a fair offer considering the value it brings.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1250000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
