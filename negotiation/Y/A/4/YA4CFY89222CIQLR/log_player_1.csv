Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500.
