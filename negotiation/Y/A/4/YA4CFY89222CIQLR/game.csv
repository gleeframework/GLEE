"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I understand the product's value, $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $7,500? I believe that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,5,
