Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $12,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum price point. I'm confident this price still allows for a fair profit for you and provides a great value for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
