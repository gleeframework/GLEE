"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $700,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Could you do $600,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to go down to $650,000, but that's as low as I can go. This product is still a highly valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.
