{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation but is still above Bob's valuation of $10,000.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you some wiggle room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps keep the negotiation focused and efficient.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can then decide to either counter-offer him, or choose to accept John's offer of $15,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $10,000 is a better price than Bob's original valuation, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my desired range."

While $10,500 is closer to my desired range, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and make a final counteroffer.  I want to see if I can push him a little further before resorting to selling to John."
