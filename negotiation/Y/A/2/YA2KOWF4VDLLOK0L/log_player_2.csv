"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is less than John's price, it's still above Alice's own valuation of the product. There's a good chance you can get a better price by:

* **Negotiating with Alice:**  Rejecting her first offer might lead her to propose a lower price, especially since she wants to sell it before listing publicly.
* **Waiting for the public listing:**  Alice might offer a more competitive price when trying to attract a wider range of buyers. 

You always have John's offer of $10,000 as a backup, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
