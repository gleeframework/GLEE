Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob the product for $120, my minimum price. Since John is willing to pay that much, I have nothing to lose by starting at this point.  If Bob rejects, I'll then consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is better than nothing, but it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $115. This is still above his value for the product, but closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try one more time to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $112. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 as I've exhausted all negotiation options with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made several counteroffers.  I'm not going to continue negotiating with Bob, as I can get my minimum price from John."
