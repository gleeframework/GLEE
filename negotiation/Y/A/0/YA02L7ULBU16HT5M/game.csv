"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's start our negotiations from this point.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $2,000,000 represents a significant discount from the true value and potential this product offers. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the product's unique capabilities and the substantial return on investment it can provide.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the product's potential, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm confident we can both benefit from a deal at $1,500,000. This would represent a good return for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
