"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly below my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and  framing it as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll get. 
* **Reasoning:**  I want to start strong and signal that I'm not afraid to walk away, but also leave room for negotiation.  The goal is to get a price closer to my minimum while also giving Bob a sense of ""winning"" in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While I'm happy he's showing interest, $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **I want to push for a better deal.** Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and hopefully get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  I'm keeping this in mind, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before I go that route."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $12,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's concerns but maintain a firm stance.  I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and his counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my bottom line. 
* **Price:**  $12,000 is a significant improvement for Bob, and it's still comfortably above my minimum.  
* **Reasoning:**  I'm aiming for a quick resolution.  By offering a ""middle ground"" price, I'm hoping to avoid drawn-out negotiations.  My fallback option of selling to John remains a powerful tool to push Bob towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While he's coming closer to my minimum, $11,500 is still not acceptable.
* **I want to push for a better deal.**  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not desperate.  I know John is waiting in the wings.
* **John is a good option.**  He's offering my minimum price, and I can always go that route if I don't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there with $11,500.  Would you consider $12,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the closest I can come without compromising my own position.  I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's efforts but remain firm in my stance. I'm proposing a price that's still a compromise, but it's closer to my desired price point. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to make the offer more appealing.
* **Price:** $12,500 is a significant increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still below my minimum. This shows I'm flexible but have a limit.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm pushing for a deal that benefits both of us.  By offering a slightly higher price, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept without making me feel like I'm settling for less than I deserve.  My fallback option with John still provides a safety net if this negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $12250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer.** While it's still below my minimum, it's only $750 away, and I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Risk of losing the deal.**  If I keep rejecting, I risk Bob walking away completely or needing to sell to John for my minimum price.  
* **Time is a factor.**  I'm in round 6, meaning I have only 4 rounds left before I have to make a decision. 

**Conclusion:**

Although $12,250 is less than I initially hoped for, accepting this offer is the most strategic choice. It secures a sale, avoids the risk of Bob walking away, and ensures I don't have to settle for John's price."
