"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a price that reflects the potential benefits this product can bring. I understand that you may need time to consider this offer, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. However, I do have another buyer who is interested in purchasing the product for $1000000. So if you're not interested, I'll be moving forward with that offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000. Alice's offer of $1,500,000 exceeds your budget.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for a significantly lower price."
