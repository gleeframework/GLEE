Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's too low, and I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate, but $12,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,750, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and it's better than selling to John for a lower price. It's also likely that I wouldn't be able to get a higher price from Bob in the next round."
