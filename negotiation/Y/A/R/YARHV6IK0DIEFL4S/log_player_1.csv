Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer myself. I'll also keep in mind the opportunity to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're open to negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000,  as that's my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,250 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's a reasonable compromise.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale, and I can always try to negotiate better prices in future deals."
