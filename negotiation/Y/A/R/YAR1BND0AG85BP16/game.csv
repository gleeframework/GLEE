"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this time. I'm very interested in the product and believe it has great potential, but my budget for it is capped at $1,250,000. If you're willing to consider this price, I'm ready to move forward. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still unfortunately a bit over budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,275,000? This would be a great compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to get a good deal as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,285,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",1285000.0,Alice,5,
