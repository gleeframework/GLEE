Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this time.

Let me know what you think.

This would be a great compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to get a good deal as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
