Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see if Bob bites or counters. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and assess whether it's worth continuing negotiations or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm not desperate to sell. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway. $1,300,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise from my original offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him.  It's also a better deal than selling to John."
