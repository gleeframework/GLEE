"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer is above his maximum budget.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is an option, but it's best to see if Bob can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his maximum budget and a better deal than buying from John.  Since there are only 7 rounds left, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept and avoid risking further negotiation."
