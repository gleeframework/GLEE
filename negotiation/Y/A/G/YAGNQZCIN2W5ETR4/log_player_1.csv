Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, we can then see if he's willing to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that undervalues the product for me.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not worth it for me. John is willing to pay $10,000, which is a better deal.  I'll choose to sell to John."
