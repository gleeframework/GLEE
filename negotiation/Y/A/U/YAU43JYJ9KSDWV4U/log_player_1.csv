Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, hoping to get a good deal.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  But I'm prepared to walk away and get my guaranteed $10,000 from John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm also willing to be a bit more flexible.  $13,000 is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see that.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to consider his next offer carefully before potentially accepting it or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price.  While I'd like to get more,  I'm happy to settle for $12,500.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm not willing to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate."
