Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, but I'm open to discussion."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is a decent amount, I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price. I still have 8 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,425,000?"", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1350000, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $1375000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm feeling pressure to close the deal, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I still have 6 rounds left and I think I can get a better price than $1,375,000. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about we meet at $1,400,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1325000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum value of $1,000,000. I don't want to risk taking a deal that's so close to my bottom line.  It's better to sell to John at $1,000,000 and secure a guaranteed profit than to keep negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
