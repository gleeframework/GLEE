``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit for you. It's important to keep in mind that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, so you have a fallback option."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum desired price. I'm going to try to get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer."

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to see if I can push for a slightly higher price before considering selling to John."
