"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong anchor price significantly above both our valuation and Bob's. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price exceeding our minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  The language conveys the product's value and positions it as an exclusive opportunity, subtly influencing Bob's perception.
* **Open to Discussion:**  We invite Bob's feedback to gauge his interest and flexibility, setting the stage for a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant increase, it's still below our target and leaves potential profit on the table. We're early in the negotiation and have room to maneuver. Rejecting this offer signals that we're aiming higher while keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is strong, the true value of this product is reflected in its potential for even greater returns. I can consider a price of $1,550,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our initial price, demonstrating flexibility while still exceeding our $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's potential value, subtly pushing back against Bob's lower valuation.
* **Compromise Framing:**  Positioning the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" aims to make Bob feel more agreeable to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,450,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, suggesting he's invested in the negotiation and values the product.
* **Profit Potential:**  We are still significantly above our minimum sale price to John. Accepting at this point would mean leaving a potential $250,000 on the table.
* **Time Consideration:**  We are only on Round 4 of 10. While we don't want to drag it out unnecessarily, we have time for strategic concessions.

By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we are aiming for a higher price point while still engaging in good-faith negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your understanding of the value this product brings.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This offer reflects the product's significant potential and represents my final position."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We are now firmly stating this is our final offer to add a sense of urgency and signal a strong stance.
* **Justification:** We've linked the price to ""significant potential,"" subtly reminding Bob of the missed opportunity if he walks away. 
* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** While not a true mathematical halfway point, framing it this way aims to make Bob feel like we've made a significant concession to meet his needs.

This strategy aims to secure a deal at a strong price point while also preparing for the possibility of walking away if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has now presented his ""final offer."" While we could push further, there's a risk he'll walk away, leaving us with John's lower offer.
* **Excellent Profit:**  $1,475,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum ($1,200,000) and a good outcome for our negotiation.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds, where the deal could potentially fall apart.

By accepting Bob's final offer, we maximize our potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
