"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140, which is a fair price considering the product's value.",140.0,Alice,3,,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $130, which is the highest I'm willing to go below my minimum price.",130.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm really close to my limit.  How about we settle on $125? I think that's a fair compromise considering both our positions.",125.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. This is the lowest I can go while still making a profit. If you're willing to meet me at $135, I'd be happy to sell it to you.",135.0,Alice,7,,
