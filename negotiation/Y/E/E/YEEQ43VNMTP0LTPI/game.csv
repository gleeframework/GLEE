"I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9000 is simply not feasible for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's try to bridge the gap here.  I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is still a good deal considering what the product is worth to you.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
