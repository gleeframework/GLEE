"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging its value to me. While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $16,000? It's a good compromise, and we can both get a fair deal.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still looking to get a good profit on this deal. How about we compromise at $17,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to give you a better deal than my initial offer of $18,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference - $16,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",16500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,750. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $16,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $16,500.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'm going to have to explore other options.",16500.0,Bob,6,
