"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice might accept a price closer to Bob's $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,800. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $10,800 is less than Bob's maximum of $10,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Bob already made a counteroffer, and Alice rejected it. Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, especially since Alice is willing to compromise.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a chance Alice might not accept and he'd have to buy from John at $10,000. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees the purchase at a price within his budget."
