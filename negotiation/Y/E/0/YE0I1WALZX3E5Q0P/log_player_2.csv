"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He has 10 rounds and a fallback option of buying from John at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $95.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to test the waters. He's aiming to be in the middle ground between his maximum price ($120) and Alice's minimum price ($80).  This counteroffer also includes a message to show Alice he's serious about negotiating, but still sees value in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point, and $105 is a good deal considering Bob's maximum price of $120.  He's saved $15 compared to buying from John, and there's a chance he could get an even better price in later rounds, but the risk of Alice rejecting future offers is increasing."
