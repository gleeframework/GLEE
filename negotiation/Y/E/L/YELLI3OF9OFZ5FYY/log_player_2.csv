"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you is $150, I propose we aim for a fair deal. Would you consider purchasing it for $120? This offer allows us both to benefit and ensures a mutually satisfactory transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.** This is less than your maximum willingness to pay ($150). 
* **Buying from John would cost you $150.** 
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $30.** 

Even though Alice's offer is above her own valuation of the product ($100), it still represents a good deal for you."
