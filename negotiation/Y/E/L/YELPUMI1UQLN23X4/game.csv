"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $775000 is a bit too high, so I'll offer $760000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",760000.0,Bob,6,
