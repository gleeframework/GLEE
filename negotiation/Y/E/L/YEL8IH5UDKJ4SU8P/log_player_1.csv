Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, my goal is to maximize profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, I need to offer a price that's appealing but leaves me with a substantial gain.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong opening offer. It's significantly lower than my guaranteed price from John, giving Bob a potential ""deal"", while still securing me a $150,000 profit above Bob's valuation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing my potential earnings."
