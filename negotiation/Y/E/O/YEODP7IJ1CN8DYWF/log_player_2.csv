"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You value the product at $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $1,100,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You'll only buy from John if you can't reach a better deal with Alice."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While she came down from her initial price, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  I'll only buy from John if I can't reach a better deal with Alice."
