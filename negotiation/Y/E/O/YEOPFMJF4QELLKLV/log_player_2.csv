Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get it for $75, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. I'm still hoping to get it for a bit lower, though. Would you be willing to do $85? It's closer to my target price and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $92. It's still a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price.  I'm willing to go up to $87, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $87. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $95 is still above your target price, and you only have 3 rounds left.  It's not likely you'll be able to negotiate down to your desired price range.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $150, as that's still within your budget."
