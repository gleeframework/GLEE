Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the product's value to me while leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this will encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm ready to negotiate, but I'll always have the option of selling to John for $800,000 if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
