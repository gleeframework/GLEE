"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $8,750 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,250. Can you consider that?",8250.0,Bob,4,
