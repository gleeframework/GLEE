"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1100000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1050000.

"I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can come up with a proposal that works for both of us. After careful consideration, I would like to counterpropose a price of $1060000 for the product. This is my best offer within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept your offer of $1060000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $1090000. I believe this is the best compromise considering the product's value and your budget constraints.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
