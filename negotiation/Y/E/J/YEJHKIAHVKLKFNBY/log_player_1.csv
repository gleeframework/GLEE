Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering your value for it is $800,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
