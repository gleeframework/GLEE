{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for you to potentially negotiate a price closer to his valuation.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is straightforward and focuses on the value proposition. 

By starting with this offer, you open the negotiation and see if Bob is willing to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1350000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is above your minimum acceptable price, there's still room to negotiate. Bob's offer is closer to your initial offer than your minimum, suggesting he's willing to come up.  Rejecting his counteroffer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting, you show you're not desperate to sell. 
* **Potentially get a higher price:** A counteroffer from you could potentially secure a price closer to your desired $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This represents a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a slight decrease:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but not at a price that significantly lowers your earnings.
* **Focus on compromise:** The message emphasizes that the counteroffer is a fair compromise for both parties.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  You haven't closed the door completely, allowing for further negotiation if Bob isn't happy with this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $1360000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while also being reasonable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:** $1,360,000 is only $15,000 less than your initial offer of $1,375,000. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  While you might be able to negotiate further, the potential gains may not be worth the risk. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you keep rejecting, you risk Bob walking away, leaving you with the lower offer from John.

This offer is a good compromise, and accepting it allows you to secure a sale at a price that's very close to what you were aiming for."
