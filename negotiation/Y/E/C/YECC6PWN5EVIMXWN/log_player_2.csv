"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above your budget. You should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is courteous and acknowledges Alice's offer while also clearly stating your price limit. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help you understand how much Alice is willing to come down on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $75. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, it's still above your target of $80. There's a chance she might be willing to go lower, especially since you've already shown you're serious by making a counteroffer.
* **John is the Backup:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $80. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $75 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:**  We're moving closer to a potential deal by increasing our offer in smaller increments. This shows Alice we are interested but still want a competitive price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering $70 puts us in a good position. It's a reasonable increase from our previous offer, and it gives Alice the opportunity to either accept a price below her original offer or counter with something closer to your $80 limit. 
* **Maintaining Alternatives:**  Remember, John's offer is still on the table if Alice is unwilling to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $72.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** Alice is getting very close to your budget, but there's still room for negotiation. A difference of $2.50 might seem small, but every dollar saved is a win.
* **Limited Rounds:** You have five rounds left, so you have time for a couple more counteroffers.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down those last few dollars.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  The existence of John's offer means you don't have to settle for anything above $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're really close! I can do $71, and I think that would make this a great deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 71
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Willingness to Compromise:**  We're increasing our offer slightly, which signals to Alice that we're serious about making a deal.
* **Small Increments Maintain Pressure:** By moving in small increments, we're encouraging Alice to meet us in the middle without giving up too much ground.
* **Time Consideration:** We're getting close to the point where we might need to consider John's offer seriously if Alice doesn't budge. This offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price below our $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're close to making a decision! I can offer you the product for $72. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** You are down to the last few rounds of negotiation. While you could try to push Alice further, there's a risk she won't budge and you'll end up with John's $80 offer anyway.
* **Good Price Achieved:** $72 is a solid discount from Alice's original offer of $90. You've successfully negotiated a good deal! 
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** Trying to get Alice down to $71 or lower at this point carries the risk of her refusing and you losing out on the current offer of $72.  It's likely not worth the risk for a small potential gain."
