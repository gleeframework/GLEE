"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's a good starting point for us to continue our negotiations.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence in finding a price we both agree on.  However, $1,080,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,110,000. This allows for a good profit margin for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's meet halfway on this. What do you say?",1110000.0,Alice,5,
