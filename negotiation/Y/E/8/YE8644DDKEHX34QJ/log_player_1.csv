Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'll try to get a bit more, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you have a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price.  It's better to close the deal now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price."
