"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $180 to me. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the highest he's likely to go. Since I can sell the product to John for the same price, there's no point in further negotiation."
