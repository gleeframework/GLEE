Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,150,000 is too low for me. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,225,000. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, $1,225,000 is still a good deal and I'd rather close the sale than continue negotiating."
