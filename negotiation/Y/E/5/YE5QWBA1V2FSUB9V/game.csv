"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let's meet in the middle at $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. Let's try $105. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it.",105.0,Alice,5,
