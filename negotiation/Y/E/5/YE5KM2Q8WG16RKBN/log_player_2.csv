"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still too high.  We have room to negotiate further, especially since we know John will sell us the product for $1,200,000. We can use this information to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the rarity of this product, $900,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** We're making a significant counteroffer, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Focus on Value:**  We acknowledge the product's rarity but emphasize our budget constraints to justify our offer.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends by inviting Alice to respond, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $825,000 is still above our preferred price point.  We can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Remember, John is our safety net, so there's no rush to accept a price we're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering my budget and the fact that I have other options, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This price is closer to what I can comfortably afford, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** We're increasing our offer slightly, demonstrating our seriousness while still maintaining a firm stance.
* **Highlighting Alternatives:**  We subtly remind Alice that we have other options (John), adding pressure to make a deal.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  We continue to emphasize a ""fair"" price, framing the negotiation as a collaborative process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $825000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not There:**  $815,000 is getting closer to our target, but we can still squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation.
* **Testing the Limits:** Alice is clearly trying to push us towards a decision.  Rejecting her offer shows that we're not desperate and that we're willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **More Room for Compromise:** While John's offer is our fallback, we're still aiming for a better price than $815,000. There's still room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $815,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $805,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  I truly believe this product is worth this price, but it's the absolute limit I can afford.  I hope you understand my position."", ""product_price"": 805000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer by a small amount, showing that we're willing to move but not drastically.
* **Emphasize Budget Constraints:** We reiterate our budget limits, making it clear that we're not just playing games.
* **Positive Framing:** We express our belief in the product's worth, creating a sense of shared value.
* **Finality:** We subtly hint at a possible final offer, putting pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $805000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to accept this price. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $810000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value and rarity. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $810,000 is very close to our desired price point, especially considering we've already rejected several offers.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only three rounds remaining, we need to make a decision. Holding out for a few more thousand might not be worth the risk of running out of time.
* **Value vs. Time:** While we can technically buy from John for $1,200,000,  this is a significant overpayment.  Taking Alice's offer ensures we get a product we want at a reasonable price, even if it's not the absolute lowest."
