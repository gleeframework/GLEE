"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the rarity of this product, $900000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $825000 is still a bit high for me. Considering my budget and the fact that I have other options, I'm willing to pay $800000.  This price is closer to what I can comfortably afford, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $825000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value and rarity.",815000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $815000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $805000, which is a significant compromise for me.  I truly believe this product is worth this price, but it's the absolute limit I can afford.  I hope you understand my position.",805000.0,Bob,6,
