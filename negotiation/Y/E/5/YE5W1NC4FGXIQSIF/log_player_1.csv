Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum price before selling to John.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price.  I'll counter Bob's offer one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my minimum.  Let's try $8,900.  This is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 one more time. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

We've reached a point where Bob and I are very close on price, but I'm worried about running out of rounds. It's best to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and move on."
