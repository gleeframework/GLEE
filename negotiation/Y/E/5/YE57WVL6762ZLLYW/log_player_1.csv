Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,000,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To keep things moving, I'll come down to $2,000,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** My initial offer established a high anchor. While Bob's offer is far below, I don't want to drop too drastically too soon.
* **Concession:** Coming down by $300,000 shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob why the price is higher than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I see in the product, I would like to propose an offer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches John's offer. There's no financial benefit to continuing the negotiation or waiting for John.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation breaking down. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting a sure thing is generally preferable to the uncertainty of continued negotiation, even if there was a chance of getting slightly more."
