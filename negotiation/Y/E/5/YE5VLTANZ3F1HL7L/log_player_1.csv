Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $800000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I know I can get closer to my desired price.  I need to make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. Let's keep this conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm firm at $800000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can finally find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $800,000. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I believe we can find a fair price that works for both of us. How about $1,000,000? It's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a price you can work with."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
