"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. Let's keep this conversation going.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm firm at $800000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $800000. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I believe we can find a fair price that works for both of us. How about $1000000? It's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a price you can work with.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
