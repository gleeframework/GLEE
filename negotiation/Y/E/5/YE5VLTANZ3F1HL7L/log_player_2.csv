# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. Let's keep this conversation going.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $800000. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I believe we can find a fair price that works for both of us. How about $1000000? It's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a price you can work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm getting close to my limit of 10 rounds.  I'm better off buying from John and saving myself the hassle and potential loss."
