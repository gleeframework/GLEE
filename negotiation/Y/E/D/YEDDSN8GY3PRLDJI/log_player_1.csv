Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Value for Bob:** This price is still lower than the value the product holds for Bob ($15,000), making it a potentially attractive deal for him. 
* **Strategic Position:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest while keeping my options open. If he rejects, I can either counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Potential:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my desired range.  I believe there's room for a higher price, as the product is worth more to him. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain control of the negotiation. This allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially push for a price closer to $12,000. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, it's not maximizing my profit. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $11,000 represents a compromise from my initial offer of $12,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while still seeking a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Value Gap:** The offer remains higher than Bob's last offer of $10,000, but still lower than my ideal price. This gives Bob incentive to consider the deal without feeling pressured.
* **Closing the Gap:**  By meeting halfway, I aim to incentivize Bob to accept. This counteroffer signals that I'm open to a deal, but also committed to getting a good price."
