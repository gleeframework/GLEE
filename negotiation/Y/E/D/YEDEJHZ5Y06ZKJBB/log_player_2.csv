"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1500000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is a far cry from what this product is worth to me, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to come down to $1200000, which still represents a significant discount.  This is my final offer.  If you're still interested, let's close this deal.  Otherwise, I will need to move on to other potential buyers.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my preferred price point. While it's a significant discount from her initial offer, I still think I can negotiate a lower price. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
