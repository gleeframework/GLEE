Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1500000 is outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $800000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the potential value to my business.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Otherwise, I will need to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you get a reasonable price.  I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with.
