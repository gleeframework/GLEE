"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1500000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me, but I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1500000 is outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $800000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the potential value to my business.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is a far cry from what this product is worth to me, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to come down to $1200000, which still represents a significant discount.  This is my final offer.  If you're still interested, let's close this deal.  Otherwise, I will need to move on to other potential buyers.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to reach an agreement at a lower price.  Would you be willing to come down to $1050000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you get a reasonable price.  I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
