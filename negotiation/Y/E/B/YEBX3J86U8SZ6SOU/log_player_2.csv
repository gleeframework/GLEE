It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We've reached a stalemate:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $570,000.  She's consistently met in the middle, but is holding firm at this price point.
* **Significant savings:**  $570,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $800,000 price.
* **Limited rounds:**  We only have a few rounds left, and pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal and forcing us to go with John."
