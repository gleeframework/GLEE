"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to discussing the price. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Would you be open to negotiating closer to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too far below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $140?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $140 is still too much for me.  How about $100?  It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $100 is still too low.  Let's try $120.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us both a good deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  This would be a good deal for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,6,
