"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Would you be open to negotiating closer to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'll reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too far below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $140?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $140 is still too much for me.  How about $100?  It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can get closer to a deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $100 is still too low.  Let's try $120.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  This would be a good deal for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While $110 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm also running out of time.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option for maximizing my profit at this stage."
