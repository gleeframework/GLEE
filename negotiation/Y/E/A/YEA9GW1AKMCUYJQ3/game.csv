"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product and believe it has great potential, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount based on my own assessments and projections. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true value of this product and its potential for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product and the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's try to bridge the gap and find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  However, I want to see if we can find a solution. I'm willing to consider $975,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it recognizes your interest while respecting the product's true value.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise.  While I'm very interested in the product, $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful that we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $950,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, as I believe it reflects the true value you'll be gaining. Let's close this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm very appreciative of your willingness to continue negotiating. However, $950,000 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $935,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our shared desire to reach an agreement.  This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",935000.0,Bob,8,
