{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product and believe it has great potential, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount based on my own assessments and projections. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true value of this product and its potential for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product and the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's try to bridge the gap and find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly far apart in valuation. While closing the deal now would be certain, there's a good chance we can negotiate Bob closer to a price point we're happy with.  We're willing to lose some potential profit to secure a deal with Bob, but not this much yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  However, I want to see if we can find a solution. I'm willing to consider $975,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it recognizes your interest while respecting the product's true value."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise.  While I'm very interested in the product, $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful that we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's still invested in the deal. We're getting closer to a price point where the risk of losing the deal to John is outweighed by the potential profit from Bob.  Let's push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $950,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, as I believe it reflects the true value you'll be gaining. Let's close this deal and move forward."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm very appreciative of your willingness to continue negotiating. However, $950,000 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $935,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our shared desire to reach an agreement.  This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and while not ideal, it's a strong price.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing Bob entirely, at which point we'd be forced to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  Accepting $935,000 now secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
