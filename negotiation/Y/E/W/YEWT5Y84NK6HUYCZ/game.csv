"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, but that's my final offer.  Let's make this happen.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure if $95 is the right price for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. I'm trying to get as close to my budget as possible,87.5,Bob,6,
