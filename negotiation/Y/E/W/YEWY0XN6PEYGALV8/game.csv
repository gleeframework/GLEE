"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great price considering the product's value, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's make this deal!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $115 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is my bottom line.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's close this deal!",120.0,Alice,5,
