Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still making a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while staying above my minimum selling price.
* **Time Value:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $100, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable to waiting for John."
