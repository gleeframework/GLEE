"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a good compromise and ensures we both get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about purchasing the product, and I appreciate your commitment. $9,500 is closer, but it's still a bit lower than what I can accept. Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000. Would you be willing to go down to $9,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,
