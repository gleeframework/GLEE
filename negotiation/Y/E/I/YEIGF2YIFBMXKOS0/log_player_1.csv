Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This price is significantly higher than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This gives Bob a strong incentive to buy, while still leaving potential room for negotiation if he's willing to pay even more. 
* **Reasoning:** By starting high, I maximize my potential earnings. If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed backup with John.  There's always a chance Bob might value the product even more than $1,500,000, allowing for further negotiation and a higher sale price."
