"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet at $100? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm getting a bit anxious to close the deal, but I think this price is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're anxious to close the deal, but I'm not willing to go up to $115. How about we meet at $105? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stick to your minimum, but I'm not willing to go back to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which is $107.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",107.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your creative suggestion, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $110. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one final offer: $108.50. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",108.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $108. I know it's a small difference, but I'm hoping we can make it work.",108.0,Bob,10,
