{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than the $8,000 Bob values the product at. 
* **Lower than my minimum:** This price is lower than my minimum of $15,000, but I am willing to negotiate down from this initial offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for negotiation, as Bob may be willing to pay more than his valuation to secure the product.

I'm confident that I can still make a good profit, but I'm also open to negotiation to secure a sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to see if we can reach a price closer to my value. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair price that still allows me to get a decent return on my investment.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with the price of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000 at this point. I want to make sure I get a fair price for my product and have room for profit."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go below $12,000.  Let's consider this my final offer. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 12000}
