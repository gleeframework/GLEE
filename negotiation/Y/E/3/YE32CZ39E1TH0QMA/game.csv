"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is still a good price for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have other options available, and  $13,500  is still a bit too high for me. To be honest, $11,500 is the absolute highest I can go. If we can make a deal at that price, I'm ready to close right now.",11500.0,Bob,6,
