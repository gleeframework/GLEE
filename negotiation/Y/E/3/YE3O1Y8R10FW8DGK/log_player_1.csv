"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high bar for Bob and gives me room to negotiate if he counters. It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to play ball."
