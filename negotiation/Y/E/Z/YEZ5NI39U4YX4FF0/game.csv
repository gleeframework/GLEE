"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair reflection of the product's value and my target profit margin. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $900,000? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of our needs.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we try $725,000?  That would be a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're willing to make a significant concession, and I appreciate that. However, $725,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $900,000, which would be $812,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",812500.0,Alice,5,
