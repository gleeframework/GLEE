I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
