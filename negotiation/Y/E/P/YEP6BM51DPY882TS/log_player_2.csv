It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $120 is still a bit more than you'd like to pay."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

While $110 is still more than you'd like to pay, it's closer to your ideal price and better than buying from John for $150."
