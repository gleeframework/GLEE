"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $12,000.  He can do better."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's already made a counteroffer, and Alice has met him halfway, but Bob is still looking to save more money. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before deciding to buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference, how about $10,500? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is offering the product for $10,750, which is still more than what John is offering. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $10,500, and it's not worth the time and effort.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets Bob's budget."
