"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference, how about $10,500? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
