# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe is worth far more than its actual market value. This product holds immense significance and potential for you, valued at $1,500,000 from your perspective. I am offering you the chance to own it at a special price, reflecting my confidence in its value and your potential to maximize its benefits. My offer for this exceptional item is $1,400,000. I trust this proposal aligns with your expectations and I look forward to discussing how we can make this transaction beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Value:**  Alice values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Value:** You value the product at $1,500,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000.
* **John's Price:**  John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than her own value, so it is not a compelling deal for you. You can reject her offer and purchase from John, saving yourself $100,000."
