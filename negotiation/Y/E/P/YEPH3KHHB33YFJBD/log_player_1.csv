Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to build Bob's interest.  I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary, but I'm confident this initial offer will encourage Bob to consider a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $85, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle. How about $80?  It's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal, and I risk losing Bob as a buyer.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation."
