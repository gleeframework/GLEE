"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000. Alice's offer is exactly that price. Accepting her offer means you get the product at your maximum price, so it's the best possible outcome.  Buying from John would cost the same, so there's no benefit to rejecting Alice's offer."
