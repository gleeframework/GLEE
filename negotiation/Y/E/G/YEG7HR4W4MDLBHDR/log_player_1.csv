"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly beyond his $10,500 offer. Accepting his offer means losing $1,500 compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut bait and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
