"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This offer takes into account the value you'll gain from the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,6,
