Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value, and I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of making a counteroffer if he rejects this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Bob's offer is too low for me, and I'm not willing to sell at that price. I believe I can still get a better price from him.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $9,500. This is still significantly lower than my minimum value, but it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close enough to my desired price point.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, it's not worth risking a deal with him and potentially ending up with nothing. Accepting this offer will guarantee a sale and a decent profit."
