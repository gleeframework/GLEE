"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, as you know the value is significant. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.  Let's find a compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and the market conditions.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $14,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't go that low. How about we settle for $15,000? This price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
