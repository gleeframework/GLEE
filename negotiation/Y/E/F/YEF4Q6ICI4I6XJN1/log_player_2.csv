"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it, and it gives me a fair return.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price than it is to her minimum. There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price, getting closer to that $1,000,000 you can get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still within a reasonable negotiation range. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price point. This might encourage Alice to make more significant concessions.
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves room for further negotiation. Even if Alice rejects this offer, we can still go up while staying below our $1,000,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our price, we're now only $50,000 away from John's price. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $1,000,000 before accepting Alice's offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($1,050,000) and our previous offer ($900,000). It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still moving towards our desired price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting we're ""ready to make a deal,"" we add a subtle sense of urgency. 
* **Still Below John:** This offer keeps us below our alternative option of buying from John for $1,000,000, maintaining our negotiating leverage."
