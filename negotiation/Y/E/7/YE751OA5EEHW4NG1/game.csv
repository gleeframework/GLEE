"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. Let's see if we can push the price up a bit further.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
