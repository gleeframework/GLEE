"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $110, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $117.50? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount. What do you think?",117.5,Alice,5,
