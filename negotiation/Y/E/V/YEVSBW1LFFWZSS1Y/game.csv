"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
