"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly unique. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
