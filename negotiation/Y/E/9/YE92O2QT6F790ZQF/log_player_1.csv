Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good strategy in negotiation to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  By starting at $11,000, we can see how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His response will give us information for the next round of negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the option to sell to John for $8,000, so we don't want to accept anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Room for More:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is above our minimum selling price ($8,000), but still significantly lower than his perceived value ($12,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **Maintain Value:** Accepting his first counteroffer might signal that we're willing to go much lower. By rejecting it, we emphasize the product's value. 
 
**Next Step:** We will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to close the gap and reach a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $11,000 is already a very competitive price for this product considering its value. To meet you halfway, I could consider $10,250. This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 10250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to show a willingness to negotiate while still advocating for a strong price. We're not simply splitting the difference between his offer and ours, but moving closer to his price point to encourage agreement.
* **Justification:**  By re-emphasizing the product's value, we're reminding Bob why he's willing to pay a premium in the first place.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps us significantly above our ""walk-away"" price ($8,000) while hopefully moving closer to a deal with Bob."
