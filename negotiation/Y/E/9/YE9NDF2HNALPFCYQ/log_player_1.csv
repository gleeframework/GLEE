Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in his mind.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob (is he a tough negotiator? Easily swayed?) you might adjust the offer and message accordingly."
