Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point.  This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. Let's meet in the middle a bit - how about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're still some distance apart. However, I've got another buyer ready at $1,000,000.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing hardball and has introduced a sense of urgency with the ""other buyer."" While her price is coming down, it's clear she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,200,000.  Knowing John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, it makes more sense to cut losses and secure the deal with John."
