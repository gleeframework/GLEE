"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point.  This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. Let's meet in the middle a bit - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still pretty far apart.  I can go up to $950,000, but that's my limit for now.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still some distance apart. However, I've got another buyer ready at $1,000,000.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
