Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point.  This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price.  How about we bring it down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4

We're still significantly below my minimum.  Time to apply more pressure and highlight the alternative."
