"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a fair agreement. I propose selling the product to you for $140. This price not only reflects the product's worth but also ensures a reasonable profit for me. Please let me know if this offer suits you, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is too high. There's a chance you can get a better price, so it makes sense to reject and see if she'll come down. You can always buy from John for $150 if needed."
