Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and constraints:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential benefits for you, I propose a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible (Bob's valuation) without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,450,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This price signals that Alice understands the product's value to Bob but also wants a significant share of the profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing she has John as a backup at $1,200,000 gives Alice a strong bargaining position. She's not desperate, allowing her to aim higher with Bob."
