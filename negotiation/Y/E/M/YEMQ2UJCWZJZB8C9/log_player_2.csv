"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and allows me to earn a good profit.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This price is still a good profit for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is still a very good deal for you considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows me to counter again and hopefully reach a price closer to my target.  It's still a good deal for me, as I can buy from John for $1,200,000 if needed."
