"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. However, I'm leaving room for negotiation, as I'm aware Bob values the product at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by rejecting his offer and potentially needing to counteroffer.  $110 is a good outcome, considering I could have ended up selling to John for $120, but I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the future."
