"Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential benefits I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly unique and significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this revised price reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price given the market value and my own needs. If you're unwilling to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
