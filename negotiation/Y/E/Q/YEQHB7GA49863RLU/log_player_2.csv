"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can do much better by either negotiating with Alice or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price point significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for potential compromise. It also signals your seriousness about buying the product while remaining within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
This is a good deal for you as it's within your budget and significantly better than going with John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or raising the price makes accepting her offer the best option at this point."
