"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to go down to $140. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",130.0,Bob,4,
