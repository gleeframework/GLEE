Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $115 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a profit significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $119 or $118 might make Bob feel like he's being squeezed and could make him more likely to walk away. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and securing a deal with Bob."
