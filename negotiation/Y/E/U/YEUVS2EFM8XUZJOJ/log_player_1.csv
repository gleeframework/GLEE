Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth at least $1,000,000 in the value it could bring. I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000.  I think it's a small price to pay for something that can deliver such significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to aim significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the potential value to Bob, aiming to justify a price much higher than his perceived $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a very high number ($1,900,000), you anchor Bob's perception of the product's price. Even if he negotiates down, it's unlikely he'll go as low as John's offer.

**Important Note:** This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. Bob might be completely turned off by the initial price and refuse to negotiate. However, given the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, it's worth the gamble to potentially gain an extra $900,000."
