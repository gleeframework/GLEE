"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) but still within the realm of possibility for Bob (who values it at $800,000).
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and highlighting the potential for future value. This helps to justify the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a positive, open-ended statement to encourage Bob to engage in further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Potential:** While $900,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can still secure a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have 8 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $1,000,000. This gives me some leverage to push for a better deal.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer closer to my desired price point, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 isn't quite enough to cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from the initial $1,200,000. 
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the remaining price. 
* **Fair Deal Emphasis:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My counteroffer remains above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we discuss a price closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is Money:**  We are already in round 4. Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rounds and potentially lower offers.  
* **No Better Option:** While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not guaranteed a higher price. Selling to John at $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome. 
* **Risk Management:**  It's always a good idea to secure a deal when it meets your minimum requirements, especially when the alternative is uncertain."
