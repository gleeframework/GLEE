"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking $11,500 could work for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to think about the value this product brings to you. How about we try $11,250? I'm confident you'll see the value in that price point.",11250.0,Alice,5,
