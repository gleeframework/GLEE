"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time.  Let me know if this is a starting point for us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, and $1,100,000 is closer to what I can work with. However, I'm still limited to $1,075,000 at this time. This offer reflects a significant amount of savings for you compared to your initial price, and it's a strong starting point for us to find common ground. ",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,075,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,090,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $1,090,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,080,000. This is a significant price reduction from your initial offer and reflects my genuine desire to acquire this product. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
