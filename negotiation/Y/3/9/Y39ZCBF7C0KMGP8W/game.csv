"Alice,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm  very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is a serious offer and reflects the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $2,200,000 represents a fair valuation, I understand your budget constraints.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point still reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,900,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. To make this work for both of us, I'm offering  $1,100,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
