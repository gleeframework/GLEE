"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. Let's make this deal happen! I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's worth trying to get a better price than $95, especially since you have 10 rounds and a backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering your offer, I would like to counter by suggesting we meet in the middle. How about $90 for the product? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You are still trying to save as much as you can, so it's worth seeing if you can get a lower price. The middle ground is a reasonable starting point, but you might be able to get closer to your desired $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for staying firm on your offer. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to go down to $87 for the product. This is the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit for myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $87, which is only $2 more than your desired price of $85.  It's a good deal for you, and you're still saving $13 compared to buying from John."
