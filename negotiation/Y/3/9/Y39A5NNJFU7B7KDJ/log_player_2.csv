{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price. Alice's initial offer is above your budget, so rejecting it and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with the maximum I'm willing to pay, hoping Alice might be willing to meet me in the middle. This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is $1,100,000, which is still within my budget and closer to my initial counteroffer.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer and I'll end up paying the same amount to John. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, minimizing the risk of losing out."
