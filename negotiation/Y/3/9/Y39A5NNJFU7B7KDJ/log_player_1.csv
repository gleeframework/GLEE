Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This gives Bob the opportunity to accept the deal immediately, knowing that if he rejects, I have another buyer lined up who will pay my minimum price.  This puts the pressure on Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial price of $1,200,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation and is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving Bob a chance to secure a better deal than his initial offer."
