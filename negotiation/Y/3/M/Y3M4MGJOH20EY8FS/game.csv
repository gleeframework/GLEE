"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $11,000? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my spending. Could we do $10,900?  I think that's a fair compromise.",10900.0,Bob,4,
