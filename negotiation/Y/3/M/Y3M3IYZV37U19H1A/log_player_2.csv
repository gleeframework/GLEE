"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal, considering its worth to me is significantly higher. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer, as it's above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Bob should buy the product from John for $12,000. Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's budget, and further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed. Buying from John offers a definite price within Bob's budget, minimizing risk and maximizing savings."
