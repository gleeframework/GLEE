"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. It's a great deal, considering the value this product will bring to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I'm willing to compromise at $13,500. It's a great price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a good middle ground. Let's finalize this deal, I think we're both very close.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,7,
