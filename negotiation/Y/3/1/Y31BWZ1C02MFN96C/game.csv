"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $950,000? That leaves a nice margin for both of us. Let's work this out together.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $925,000? That's my final offer.",925000.0,Bob,4,
