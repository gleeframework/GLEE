"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I have to say that $1200000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. It's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I have to say that I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, but $1700000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
