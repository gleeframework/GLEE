# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
