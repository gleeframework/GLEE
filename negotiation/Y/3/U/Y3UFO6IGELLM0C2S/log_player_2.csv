This is a significant discount, considering its value. Let me know if you're interested.  I'm confident you won't regret this opportunity!

(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I accept it, I'll be paying $15,000, which is more than I'm willing to spend. I'll look for a better deal.
