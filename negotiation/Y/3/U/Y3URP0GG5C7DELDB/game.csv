"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,200,000. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle -  I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I am only able to offer $1,000,000. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford at this time. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
