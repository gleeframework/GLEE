Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired outcome while still being potentially appealing to Bob. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to Bob makes the offer more tempting. 
* **Negotiation Space:** This price leaves room for negotiation, which is important since Bob is known to value the product higher. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to sell to John for $80 if negotiations with Bob fail, ensuring I won't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I believe I can get closer to $100 through further negotiation.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and will stand my ground on the price. 
* **Maintain Upper Hand:**  By rejecting, I keep control of the negotiation and can potentially push for a better deal.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $100. I'll try to find a middle ground while keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a good compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This demonstrates good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to remind him that my offer is still reasonable. 
* **Closing the Gap:** $95 gets me closer to my goal of $100 while still leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Urgency:**  The ""finalize this deal"" statement adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Plan B:** I'm keeping John in mind as my backup option if Bob rejects this offer. However, I'm confident that $95 is a fair price that will be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $92 is very close to my target price of $100, and I'm unlikely to get a significantly higher offer from Bob.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John for $80. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profit that is close to my desired outcome.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Further negotiation could drag on, and I'm satisfied with the potential profit.  

**Decision:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical and efficient choice in this situation, considering the potential risks and the fact that $92 is a strong price."
