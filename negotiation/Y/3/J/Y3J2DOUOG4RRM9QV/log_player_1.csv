Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $110. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $110, which is close to Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $110, I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation. This is important to keep Bob engaged and potentially lead to a successful deal.
* **Knowing My Bottom Line:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $80, so I'm comfortable not accepting offers below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $90 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Room for counter-offer:** I can still potentially negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll get great value from the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm offering $100, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90.  
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and worth the price.
* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I have a firm understanding of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is just $5 below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer further.  Accepting this offer means I'm securing a sale that's close to my minimum and avoiding the risk of a lower offer or no sale at all.
* **Time constraint:**  While there's no explicit time constraint mentioned,  the back and forth negotiation suggests that I should be mindful of time.  Accepting this offer allows me to move on to other potential deals or tasks."
