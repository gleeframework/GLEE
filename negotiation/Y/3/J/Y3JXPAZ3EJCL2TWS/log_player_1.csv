"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets a high baseline and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob, highlighting its worth as an asset. 

This strategy aims to create a good starting point for the negotiation while leaving room for me to potentially settle for a price closer to Bob's value if needed, without losing too much of my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1200000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is not ideal, it's not a complete deal-breaker. There's still potential for negotiation and a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to explore a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a secure option, but I'm willing to risk continued negotiation with Bob to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for the product. It's still a fantastic deal, and I believe it will be worth every penny for you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a significant compromise, moving closer to Bob's price while still maintaining a profitable margin for me.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and presenting my offer as a fair and attractive deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging, emphasizing the potential for a successful agreement.

This strategy aims to maintain a strong negotiating position while showing a willingness to compromise and potentially reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress in Negotiation:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and potentially a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safe bet, I'm not ready to settle for it yet. 
* **Strategic Play:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to explore a counteroffer that might lead to a price closer to my desired range. 

I'm willing to take a calculated risk and continue the negotiation to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $950,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise that splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate fairly.
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer brings us closer to a potential agreement. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product and highlight how the price benefits both of us.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I encourage Bob to accept this offer, creating a sense of urgency to close the deal.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards a mutually beneficial agreement, while still securing a price above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900000. It's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is sticking to his offer of $900,000, and I'm unlikely to get him to budge much further.
* **Time Constraint:** We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation, and I need to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safe and guaranteed profit. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's a real chance we won't reach a mutually agreeable price. It's better to secure a deal with John and avoid further potential losses.

Selling to John is the most prudent decision at this point, ensuring a solid profit and minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation."
