"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $90? I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $105? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal on this amazing product!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $105 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $95? That's a good middle ground and would allow me to purchase the product. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $100? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
