"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
