"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $15000 on it. Considering my budget and the value I place on similar items, I would like to propose a price of $14000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $16000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've given the matter careful consideration and while I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle, I still feel that $16000 is beyond my current budget. I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $15000. This feels like a reasonable compromise for both of us, taking into account the product's value and my financial situation.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $15000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous offer, and I'm not willing to go further. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm proposing a new price of $16250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
