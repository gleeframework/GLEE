"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $14,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still being closer to my ideal price than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I'm getting close to the halfway point in negotiations. Bob is offering $12,800, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I'm confident that I can make a profit on this deal. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
