"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely an intriguing product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $920,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  Let's split the difference and go with $885,000.  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident we can close this transaction.",885000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I need to think about my minimum profit margin, and $885,000 is still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $885,000 and $920,000, so I'm going to counter with $902,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap this up soon.",902500.0,Alice,5,
