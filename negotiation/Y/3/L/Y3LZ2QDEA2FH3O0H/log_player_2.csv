"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely an intriguing product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is still quite high, leaving room for further negotiation.  We can try to bridge the gap with a counteroffer closer to $850,000 before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $920,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  Let's split the difference and go with $885,000.  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident we can close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 885000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I need to think about my minimum profit margin, and $885,000 is still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $885,000 and $920,000, so I'm going to counter with $902,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap this up soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $902,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $902,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $902,500 is still a good deal for Bob. While he can try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer is the most prudent decision, as it secures the product for a reasonable price while avoiding the higher cost of buying from John."
