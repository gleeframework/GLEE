Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you have room to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $12,000 offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you can still negotiate down towards his perceived value ($8,000) while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($10,000)."
