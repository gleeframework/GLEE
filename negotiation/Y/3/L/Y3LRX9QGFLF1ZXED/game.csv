"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $950,000 is certainly a respectable offer, the value this product holds for you is undeniable. Let's meet in the middle – I'm willing to part with it for $1,050,000.  This adjustment reflects my desire to strike a deal, while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference – I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price represents a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident that we can finalize this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
