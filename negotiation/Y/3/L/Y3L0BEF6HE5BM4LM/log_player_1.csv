"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly ask for Bob's thoughts, signaling my willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts a price close to my initial offer, I secure a fantastic deal.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:** His response will reveal how eager he is to buy and how much he might be willing to pay.

It's important to remember I have John as a backup offer, giving me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value, but considering my budget, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. Would $1,800,000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a substantial increase from his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for further negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a higher price while keeping the door open for him to improve his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,800,000 falls short of what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $200,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to justify the price, even though I'm making a concession.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The message frames this offer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

By making a significant but not drastic counteroffer, I'm testing Bob's flexibility and putting the ball back in his court.  I'm hoping he'll recognize I'm negotiating seriously and respond with a more competitive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I still feel that we might be able to reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would $1,900,000 be within your consideration? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which indicates he's motivated. However, $1,900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push him closer to $2,000,000. 

The risk of losing Bob as a buyer is calculated. I have John as a reliable backup offer, so I can afford to be a bit bolder in my negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It's clear we both see the value in this product.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  By calling this a ""final offer"" I'm signaling that this is my bottom line while still offering a slight concession. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:** Highlighting my willingness to compromise makes it more palatable for Bob to accept and minimizes the chance of him walking away.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,950,000 is a strong yet reasonable position. It's a price I'm happy with, and it gives Bob a final chance to secure the product at a price significantly lower than my initial offer. 

If Bob rejects this, I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer.  I've negotiated strategically, and I'm confident in my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've thought about your last offer, Alice. I'm willing to consider $1,930,000 as a final bid for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not my ideal price, $1,930,000 is a substantial amount and surpasses my minimum by a significant margin. Accepting this offer is a strategic win:

* **Strong Profit:**  I'm securing a profit of $430,000 over Bob's perceived value and $430,000 less than my ideal. 
* **Minimizes Risk:** Continuing to negotiate might push Bob away, especially since he's signaled this is his final bid. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now allows me to utilize the funds sooner rather than potentially dragging out negotiations. 

While I could hold out for a slightly higher offer, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer outweighs the potential for slightly more profit.  Accepting now guarantees a very good outcome."
