"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
