"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $1,100,000.

"I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
