Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so this offer gives him a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob, giving me the chance to negotiate further. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response.  If he rejects the offer, I will consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a new offer.  If the negotiations seem to be dragging on, I will keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
