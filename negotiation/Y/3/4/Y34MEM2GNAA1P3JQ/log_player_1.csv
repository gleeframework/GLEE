Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to build rapport. 
* **Flexibility:**  This offer allows for counteroffers, giving me the opportunity to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup, willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This provides a safety net and gives me negotiating leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I still believe there's room for negotiation. While Bob is firm at $10,000, I can try to meet him halfway.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me a sale for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me the confidence to reject Bob's current offer and explore further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be open to a price of $11,000?  This would allow us both to get a fair value from the transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $11,000 splits the difference between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.  
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and focused on finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Compromise:** By offering a lower price, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and reach a deal. 
* **Plan B Still Active:** I'm still aware of John's offer of $15,000, giving me confidence in pursuing this negotiation."
