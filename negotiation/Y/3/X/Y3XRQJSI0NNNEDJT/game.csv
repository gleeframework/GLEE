"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I'm not sure I'm comfortable paying that much more than what I know I can get it for from another seller.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was hoping we could meet closer to $7500. I'm still a bit above the price I can get from another seller, and I'd like to try to save some money. Can you consider my counteroffer of $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
