Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints,  $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500.  This price reflects the value you place on the product and allows me to make a fair profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $10,000. It's important for me to make a profit on this sale, but I also want to make sure you're getting a good value for the product. Let's meet at $10,000, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I think I've reached a good point in the negotiation. Since Alice's offer is now at $10,000, which is the same price that John is offering, I think it's time to take a closer look at buying from John. I'll choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.
