"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I have to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints,  $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500.  This price reflects the value you place on the product and allows me to make a fair profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget of $10,000. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $10,000. It's important for me to make a profit on this sale, but I also want to make sure you're getting a good value for the product. Let's meet at $10,000, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome.",10000.0,Alice,5,
