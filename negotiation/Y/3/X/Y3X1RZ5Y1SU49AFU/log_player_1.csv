"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is lower than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum desired price and even lower than his own perceived value of the product. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for you.  Since you have more rounds to negotiate and a guaranteed sale to John, rejecting his offer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints,  $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500.  This price reflects the value you place on the product and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget of $10,000. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, but accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate gives you a better chance of getting closer to your desired price or at least finding a compromise that works for both parties."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $10,000. It's important for me to make a profit on this sale, but I also want to make sure you're getting a good value for the product. Let's meet at $10,000, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 10000}
