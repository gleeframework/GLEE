{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, but still above my minimum of $12,000. This allows for some negotiation space and gives Bob a good reason to accept, while still securing a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired $14,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  If that's not acceptable, I might have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price of $14,000 and is still above my minimum of $12,000.  There's a good chance I can't get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and having to settle for John's lower offer."
