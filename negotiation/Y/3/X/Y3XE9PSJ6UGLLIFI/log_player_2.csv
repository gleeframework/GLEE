"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $120 and my target price of $100. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $115, it's still above my target price of $100. I'm going to try to negotiate with Alice again, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110. This demonstrates my commitment to the negotiation while still leaving room for Alice to come down a bit.  I believe this price is fair and likely within Alice's acceptable range, given her previous counteroffer of $115."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $118 is getting closer to my target price of $100, but it's still not quite there. I've already made a counteroffer and been rejected twice. Continuing the negotiation could risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or potentially increasing the price further.  It's better to lock in the guaranteed price of $100 from John, as it's more likely to be a secure deal."
