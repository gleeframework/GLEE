"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I can come down a bit, but $120 is simply too low for me. How about $140? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $110 is simply not feasible for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $130. This price still gives me a reasonable profit while allowing you to acquire the product you need. ",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115, which is my absolute maximum. I hope we can meet at this price.",115.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. This price allows both of us to get a good deal.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, but no more. I'm really interested in making a deal, so I hope we can meet at this price.",120.0,Bob,8,
