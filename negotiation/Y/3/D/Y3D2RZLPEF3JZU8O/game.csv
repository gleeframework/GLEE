"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the value you place on it is $1200000. Let me know if you're interested!",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $975000? It's a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.",975000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $975000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $925000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,980000.0
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $980000. I've already made some concessions, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. Let's discuss $977500. It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",977500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $977500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $906250. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",906250.0,Bob,6,,
