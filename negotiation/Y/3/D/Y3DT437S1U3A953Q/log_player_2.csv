"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within my budget, I can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further, especially since she values the product at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $90. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate.  I believe this price is fair, considering Alice values the product at $80, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is higher than my initial counteroffer of $85 and even higher than her original offer of $90.  This indicates she's not willing to negotiate down further.  However, I'm still willing to try and reach a lower price before resorting to buying from John. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll be prepared to buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $88. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get a lower price than Alice's last offer of $92. I believe this price is fair and leaves room for further negotiation if needed. If Alice rejects this offer, I'm prepared to move on to John and purchase the product from him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is steadily climbing higher.  It's clear that she's not budging much, and I'm unlikely to get a price lower than $90 from her at this point. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not finding a deal with Alice is too high. John is offering a fair price of $100, and I'm willing to pay that rather than risk further negotiation with Alice.  It's time to secure the product and move on."
