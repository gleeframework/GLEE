"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking to stay within $100, and I appreciate your interest.  To be fair to myself, I can't go all the way down to $100, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet at $125. Could we possibly find a middle ground at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
