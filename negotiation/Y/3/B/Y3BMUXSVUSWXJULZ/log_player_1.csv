{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [Product Name] and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage and consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to hearing your thoughts"" shows I'm flexible and willing to discuss.  This encourages Bob to make a counteroffer if he's interested. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I have John as a safety net, so I can always walk away if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:**  Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept and get the sale quickly, it's worth seeing if I can get a bit more.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  Since Bob is interested in the product, there's a chance he might be willing to go a little higher than $100 if I push back.
* **No Immediate Pressure:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer, so I'm not under any pressure to accept Bob's offer right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking to stay within $100, and I appreciate your interest.  To be fair to myself, I can't go all the way down to $100, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:**  Start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer to show I'm taking his perspective seriously.
* **Justification:**  Provide a reason for not accepting his offer (value of the product) and a reason for my counteroffer (fair deal for both).
* **Middle Ground:**  The price of $125 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know what you think"" keeps the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet at $125. Could we possibly find a middle ground at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is only $10 above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation is Limited:** I've already reduced my price significantly from my initial offer. It's unlikely Bob will budge much further.
* **Time is a Factor:** While I could try for another counteroffer, it's possible this could drag out the negotiation without a guarantee of a better price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and guaranteed sale. 

While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars with further negotiation, the risk of losing the sale to John or a prolonged negotiation outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
