"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. Is this a price you're comfortable with?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $1350000. Is this a price you're willing to pay?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1250000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm ready to make a deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
