"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is your maximum price, there's no reason to immediately accept. You have 10 rounds to try and get a lower price from Alice. There's a possibility she's willing to negotiate, and you could potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount.  This is a bold move, but it's designed to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get the ball rolling towards a more favorable price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high. I want to see if I can push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it below Alice's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate to close the deal.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still not ideal. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate, hoping to get a better deal. There's still a chance we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still not happy with $11,800. I'm willing to take a small risk and keep negotiating, hoping for a lower price. We're close to a deal, and I'm confident that I can convince Alice to lower her price slightly more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about making a deal. It's getting close to her last offer, and I'm hoping she'll meet me halfway. We have a few rounds left, and I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000, but I'm willing to compromise slightly to get this done."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is our last round, and Alice is sticking to her initial price. While I've managed to negotiate a bit, I'm not going to be able to get the price down further. Since I can buy the product from John for the same price, I'm going to go with the sure thing and avoid any more haggling."
