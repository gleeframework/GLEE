Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves money on the table, while going too low risks Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Highlighting Bob's ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of urgency and importance.
* **Value Justification:**  Mentioning ""potential value"" subtly reminds Bob of the $1,200,000 he stands to gain.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (enough to be enticing) while securing you a $150,000 profit.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point ($1,000,000) is crucial in any counter-negotiation."
