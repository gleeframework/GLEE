"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but not to that extent. How about we meet halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you consider something around $720,000?",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 for this to make sense. Would you be willing to consider $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm serious about getting this deal done, but I need you to meet me closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This is my final offer, let's close this deal.  If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant discount, and I need a decision today.",825000.0,Alice,7,
