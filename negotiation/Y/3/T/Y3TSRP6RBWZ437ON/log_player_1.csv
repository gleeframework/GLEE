Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but not to that extent. How about we meet halfway at $950,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still a ways off. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $850,000 or higher."
