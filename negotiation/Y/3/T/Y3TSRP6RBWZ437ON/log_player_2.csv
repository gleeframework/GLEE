Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but not to that extent. How about we meet halfway at $950,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 for this to make sense. Would you be willing to consider $875,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This is my final offer, let's close this deal.  If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant discount, and I need a decision today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000 and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. Buying from John at $800,000 ensures you get the product at the best possible price."
