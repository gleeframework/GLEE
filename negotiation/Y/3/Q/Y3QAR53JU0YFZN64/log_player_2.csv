"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and offers you a substantial return on your investment. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $900,000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This offer reflects a significant discount from my initial price and provides you with a substantial opportunity for growth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
