"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and offers you a substantial return on your investment. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a counteroffer of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $900,000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This offer reflects a significant discount from my initial price and provides you with a substantial opportunity for growth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",950000.0,Bob,4,
