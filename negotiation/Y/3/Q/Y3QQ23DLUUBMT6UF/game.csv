"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a significant investment for me but closer to my budget. I'm confident this price would be beneficial for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. My revised offer is $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product, which represents a significant investment for me. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1,050,000, which is $50,000 more than your last offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm offering $950,000,  which is a significant investment for me. I'm hopeful we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is $25,000 more than your last offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
