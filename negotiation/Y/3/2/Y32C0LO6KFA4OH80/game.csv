"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this budget?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget.  $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I really appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go above $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $11,500? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the product.",11500.0,Bob,6,
