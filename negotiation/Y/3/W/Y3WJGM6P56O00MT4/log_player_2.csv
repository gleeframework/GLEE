"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is above your limit. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $95, which is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $110. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also trying to get a good deal.  It's a reasonable starting point, and if Alice rejects, we can continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $105 is closer to my limit, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. There are still rounds left, and I can potentially get a better price.  It's worth rejecting and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $100. This is a clear signal that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go higher. If Alice rejects, I can always buy from John for the same price. However, it's worth trying to close the deal with Alice if possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is still above my maximum price.  While we have a few rounds left, I'm not confident I can negotiate a better price. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John at $100 and save myself the potential for further negotiation.  It's guaranteed and aligns with my initial goal of paying no more than $100."
