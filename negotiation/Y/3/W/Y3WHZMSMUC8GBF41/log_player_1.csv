Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:**  This is a starting point that is slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation but ensures I start strong.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product to Bob.  This helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

This offer strikes a balance between trying to maximize my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  If he rejects this offer, I can then adjust my price depending on his counteroffer and the likelihood of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about offering the product for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm confident in the value of the product and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $10,250 represents a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold. 
* **Message:** The message maintains a friendly tone and emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement. It also highlights the fairness of the counteroffer. 

This counteroffer aims to push for a more favorable price while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate the compromise, I still feel there might be room for negotiation. Would it be possible to lower the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to earn more,  accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a sale to John at the same price.  By accepting his offer, I avoid the uncertainty and potential for a worse outcome."
