# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but I can likely get a better price. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $950,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is within my budget and a good deal considering my initial target of $850,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
