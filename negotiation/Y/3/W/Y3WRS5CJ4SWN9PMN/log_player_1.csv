I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer in the next round. While $160 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to sell it for $170, $165 is a good compromise and brings me closer to my desired price. It also avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to sell to John for the minimum price."
