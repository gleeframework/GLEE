""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as much money as possible. Offering the product slightly below her minimum ($1,200,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, a price of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning another buyer (John) introduces a level of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
