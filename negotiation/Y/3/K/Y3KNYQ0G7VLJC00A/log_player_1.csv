Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential $200,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might scare Bob away.  A good strategy is to aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  You're not desperate, you're offering a valuable opportunity.
* **High Price Point:**  $1,150,000 secures a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** You leave $50,000 on the table, potentially allowing Bob to counter-offer and still feel good about the deal.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price based on your risk tolerance and Bob's perceived negotiating style.
* Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a walk-away price in mind.  Anything below $1,000,000 is a loss for you."
