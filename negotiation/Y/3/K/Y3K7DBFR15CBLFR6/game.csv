"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,800,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
