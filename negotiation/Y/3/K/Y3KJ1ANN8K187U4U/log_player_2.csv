"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $680000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable item. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring lower prices."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $680,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $660,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 660000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $660000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $680000 and $660000, which would be $670000. I think that's a fair price for this high-quality product. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Savings:** At $670,000, Bob saves $130,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and this offer is close to Bob's previous counteroffer.
* **Risk:** There are only 5 rounds remaining, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price."
