{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary, while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price from him or John.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
I'm offering $95, which is still a good deal for me and closer to my minimum value. This might be enough to convince Bob, but if not, I'm still in a strong position to potentially sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get a better price from John.  I'll take the guaranteed $100 and move on."
