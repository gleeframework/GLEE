I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a higher price than I know I can get from John, but it gives me the potential for a much larger profit. 

By offering a higher price, I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my ideal target. If he rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
