Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to push him a bit further to see if I can get closer to $1,800,000. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to go as low as $1,850,000, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,725,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is not increasing at a rate that suggests he's willing to meet my minimum price.  His latest offer is even further away from my previous counteroffer.  At this point, continuing the negotiation risks missing out on John's guaranteed offer, which would be a significant financial loss.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale."
