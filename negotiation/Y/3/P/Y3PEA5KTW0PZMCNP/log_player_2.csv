"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$500,000 is a good price, but there's potential to save more.**  You have 10 rounds and can counteroffer. 
* **There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer immediately.**  But you want to explore that possibility. 
* **Buying from John is the last resort.**  You want to try negotiating with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** A $100,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a significant drop, but still allows for potential negotiation.
* **Setting a starting point:** This counteroffer sets a clear price range for further discussions.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** There's still $400,000 of your budget available, making room for potential counteroffers from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice met you halfway:**  Her counteroffer is closer to your initial counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Good deal:** $450,000 is a good price within your budget, and you've already saved $50,000 compared to John's price.
* **Limited time:**  You want to make a deal before you run out of rounds, and this is a solid offer.  

While there's always the possibility of getting a slightly lower price, accepting this offer secures the product and saves you significant money."
