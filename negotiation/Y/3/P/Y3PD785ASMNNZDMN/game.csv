"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the price I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. Given the unique value and quality of our product, I am unable to reduce the price below $15000. I hope we can find a way to reach an agreement that respects the value of the product while also fitting within your budget.",15000.0,Alice,3,
