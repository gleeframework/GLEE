"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a steal considering its unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1200000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
