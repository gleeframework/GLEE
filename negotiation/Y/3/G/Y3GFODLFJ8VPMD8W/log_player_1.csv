Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($150) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, so starting above that is key.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $145 leaves room for potential negotiation while still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Clear & Concise:** The message is straightforward and highlights the potential value to Bob."
