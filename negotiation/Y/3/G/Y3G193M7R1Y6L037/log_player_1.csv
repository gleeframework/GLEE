Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

Here's why this is a strong approach for Alice:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice aims to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. Offering it at $11,500 leaves room for negotiation but ensures a significant profit margin over her minimum ($10,000).
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning the product's value and potential benefits, Alice subtly implies it's a desirable item, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is strong, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly price-sensitive. This allows Alice to potentially secure an even higher price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact willingness to pay ($12,000).  If she had that information, she'd offer it at slightly less than $12,000 to ensure she gets the sale."
