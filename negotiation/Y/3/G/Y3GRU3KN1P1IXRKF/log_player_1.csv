Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above our minimum price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, ensuring we don't lose money."
