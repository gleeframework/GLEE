Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as much as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't decline.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $120, so offering it slightly above that makes it more enticing.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum.

By offering the product at $140, you leave room for negotiation while aiming for a price that's profitable but still attractive to Bob."
