# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. We've reached a price that's a good compromise, saving $475,000 off John's price and significantly below my initial maximum. Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away."
