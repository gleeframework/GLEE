"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My starting offer is $900,000. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $900,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant amount, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone sets the stage for a productive negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's high value to him  can help him be more open to negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and my next move. 
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's counteroffers, but always keep in mind my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Consider John's offer:**  If the negotiation with Bob stalls or doesn't reach a satisfactory price, I'll be prepared to sell to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm willing to negotiate,  $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe there's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price. Bob has already shown interest and acknowledged the product's value.
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can show that I'm serious about maximizing my profit and encourage further negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob in round 3, aiming for a price closer to my desired price point, but still within a range that's likely to be acceptable to Bob.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I'll be flexible in my negotiations, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:**  While I'm optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob, John's offer remains a viable backup option if the negotiations stall or if Bob's offers continue to be too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $750,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $850,000.  Let's continue to work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:** I'm offering $850,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my value.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the idea of finding a ""price that works for both of us"" to encourage cooperation.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** I'm stating that I'm ""still looking for a price closer to $850,000"" to avoid getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation at a much lower price.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's next move. If he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to make another counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the remaining rounds.
* **Be prepared to adjust:**  I'm ready to make further concessions if necessary, but I'll be mindful of my value and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:**  While I'm optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob, I'll continue to keep John's offer as a fallback option if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm still a bit far from that. How about we meet in the middle at $825000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is just $25,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This is a reasonable compromise, especially considering we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.
* **Potential for future gains:**  Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting this offer secures a good profit and leaves room for future potential gains. 
* **Avoiding risk:** Rejecting Bob's offer might lead to a prolonged negotiation, increasing the risk of him backing out or getting a worse deal in subsequent rounds.  

**Next steps:**

* **Close the deal:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction.
* **Future possibilities:**  While this deal is good, I'll keep in mind the value of the product and the potential for future negotiations if similar opportunities arise."
