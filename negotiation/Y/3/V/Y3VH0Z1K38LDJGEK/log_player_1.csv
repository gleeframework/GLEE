{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and focuses on the product's value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly leaves room for Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while also keeping the negotiation open.  By starting high, I can potentially earn closer to my minimum value ($15,000).  If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and potentially lower the price slightly, but only if it's still beneficial for me.  If the negotiation stalls, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he is still interested in the product. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer at a price closer to my desired value, hopefully securing a better deal.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  I'll aim to bridge the gap between our valuations while still remaining above my minimum.  I'm confident I can find a price that is acceptable to both of us, or I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make an offer.  While $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still give me some room to make this worthwhile for me, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $9,000 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message maintains a positive tone and reiterates the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation (Again):** The message again emphasizes the openness to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially come closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that is a compromise, I am signaling my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.  I am confident that this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but if he rejects, I can still adjust my price in the next round or fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum acceptable value, $7,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob's counteroffer demonstrates his continued interest, suggesting further negotiation could lead to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, potentially even close to my initial offer of $12,000.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer again. I will aim for a price closer to $9,000, hopefully finding a compromise that satisfies both of us. If that fails, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $8,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** This price is closer to Bob's perceived value of $8,000, making it more attractive to him.
* **Still Above Minimum:** It's still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, ensuring I'm not losing money.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on. It's a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product while still being within Bob's budget. If he rejects this offer, I'm willing to reconsider selling to John."
