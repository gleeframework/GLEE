"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I hope this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, which is a guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping Bob will be willing to come up a bit.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal than John's offer, and I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not high enough. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I'm determined to get a price closer to my desired range, and I have a few more rounds to try.  I also have the option to sell to John, but I'm hoping to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering my absolute minimum price of $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll sell to John, as it's a guaranteed sale.  This is a high-stakes round, and I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of the product and agrees to my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, we're running out of time. It's risky to continue negotiating and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further. 

Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures a quick and guaranteed sale. This is a safe option and allows me to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
