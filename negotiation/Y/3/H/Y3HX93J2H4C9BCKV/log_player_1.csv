"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential benefits to Bob, aiming to justify the initial offer.
* **Information Gathering:**  Bob's response to this high price will give me valuable insight into his willingness to pay and negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for me. It's clear we have a wide gap to bridge.  I'll counter-offer in the next round to try and move the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This offer reflects the product's unique benefits and potential for your business."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to engage more seriously. However, the price remains well above my $15,000 minimum and signals my product's value.
* **Reiteration of Value:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's benefits specific to Bob's business, aiming to shift his focus from the price alone to the value it offers.
* **Guaging Bob's Seriousness:** This counter-offer will help me assess Bob's real interest and willingness to meet me closer to a reasonable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a strict budget for this purchase.  Could we agree on $10,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met his own perceived value of the product, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could accept the $10,000 and close the deal, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's mention of a ""strict budget"" could be a tactic, and I'm willing to see if I can push a bit further before settling or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $15,000?  This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  I'm making it clear this is my best offer and introducing the alternative buyer (John) to add a level of urgency and pressure.
* **Meeting at My Minimum:**  I'm coming down to my absolute minimum acceptable price.  This allows me to maximize my potential profit while still leaving Bob with a potentially good deal.
* **Decision Point for Bob:**  This offer forces Bob to seriously consider if the product is worth the price difference between my offer and his budget limit."
