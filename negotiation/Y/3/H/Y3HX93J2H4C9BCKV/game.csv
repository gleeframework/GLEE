"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This offer reflects the product's unique benefits and potential for your business.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $15,000?  This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
