"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $80 is lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($120), I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.
