"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still below my minimum price. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item.",850000.0,Alice,5,
