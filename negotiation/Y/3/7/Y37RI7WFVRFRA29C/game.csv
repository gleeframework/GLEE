"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, this product is truly unique and its value to you is significantly higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
