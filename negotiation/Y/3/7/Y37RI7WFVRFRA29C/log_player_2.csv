"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, this product is truly unique and its value to you is significantly higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.
