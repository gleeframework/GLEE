"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate down closer to her value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 
We're aiming to get the price closer to the middle ground between Alice's valuation and our maximum budget. $100 is a reasonable counteroffer to start negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but $115 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

We're nudging the price closer to our target. There's a chance Alice might accept, and even if she doesn't, it signals that we're willing to negotiate but not at a price too far from our initial counter."
