"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I need ($150) to see if I can get a good deal. I know Bob values the product at $120, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get more from him. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $150 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering $155, which is still below what I'd get from John but above what Bob offered. This should keep the negotiations moving and might be enough for Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal with more negotiation. The risk of selling to John for $150 is always there, but I'm not willing to settle for $130 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering $145. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. It's a fair offer that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to cave in completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $150.  There are only a few rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going down to $135.  With only a few rounds left, I need to be more flexible. This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, and it shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the chances of Bob increasing his offer to a price I find acceptable are slim.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
