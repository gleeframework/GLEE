"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we settle on $13,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $12,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This would be a great deal for you and allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $12,900. This is my final offer, as I really need to stay within my budget. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",12900.0,Bob,6,
