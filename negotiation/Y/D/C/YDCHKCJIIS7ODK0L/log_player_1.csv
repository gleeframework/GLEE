Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While I could push for more, Bob is consistently moving upward and we are getting close to John's offer.  Accepting $1,050,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through."
