"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $170 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $155. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $155 is still slightly above my price point. I'm willing to go up to $145 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",145.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 was still a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $152.50. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get us closer to a deal. What do you think?",152.5,Alice,5,
