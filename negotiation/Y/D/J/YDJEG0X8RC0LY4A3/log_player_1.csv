"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a price of $97.50. This feels like a reasonable compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $97.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. There are still six rounds remaining and I have the option of selling to John, so I don't feel pressured to accept a price that is significantly lower than what I want."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $100? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
