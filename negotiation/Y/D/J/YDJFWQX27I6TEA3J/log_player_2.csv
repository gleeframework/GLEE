"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a strong investment for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I accept it, I will be paying $1,400,000, which is more than I'm willing to spend. Buying from John for $800,000 is a better option for me.
