"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this deal work.  This is still a great value for you, and it gives us both a chance to make a fair deal. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I appreciate the offer of $11,500, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close this out.",12500.0,Alice,5,
