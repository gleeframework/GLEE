Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140, knowing that Bob values the product at $120. This gives him some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than what I think the product is worth. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $125.  This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be agreeable to him, and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to meet me closer to my desired price, and I've already made a compromise. While $115 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation at this point.  John is a sure thing at $120, which is more than my minimum and a fair price."
