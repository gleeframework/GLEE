"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This product truly offers exceptional value.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $10,250.  How about $10,000?  That seems like a fair price that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
