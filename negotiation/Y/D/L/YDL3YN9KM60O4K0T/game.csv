"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for both of us to have a successful deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
