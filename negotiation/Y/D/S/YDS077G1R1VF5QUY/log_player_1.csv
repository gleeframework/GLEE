Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting $900,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Value:**  We have a limited number of rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will go higher.  
* **Strong Offer:** $900,000 is a significant profit above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and a respectable amount overall.
* **""Final Offer"" Psychology:** Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to move much further.

It's better to secure a strong deal now than risk the negotiation stalling and potentially getting a lower offer or missing out entirely."
