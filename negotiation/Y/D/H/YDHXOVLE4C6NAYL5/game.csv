"I appreciate your offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, I'm hoping to get a better price.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $11,250.  I think that's a fair compromise.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to consider your compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,250. I can meet you at $13,000, which is closer to my minimum price. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
