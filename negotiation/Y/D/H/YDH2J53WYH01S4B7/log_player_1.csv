"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum threshold. This gives Bob room to negotiate and makes him more likely to accept the offer.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm trying to establish a friendly and open tone to encourage a positive negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting with a price that's not my absolute maximum, I leave room for counteroffers and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  
* **More Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.  
* **Not Selling to John Yet:**  I'm not willing to accept John's offer of $80 yet, as I believe I can likely get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $110? I'm flexible, and we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language and emphasizing flexibility to keep the conversation friendly and open to a deal.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum threshold, ensuring that I'm not losing money on the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $110. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 away from my minimum selling price of $100.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 4, meaning we have limited rounds left to reach an agreement.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I continue to reject offers, I risk Bob walking away, and I'm not guaranteed to get a better offer from John. 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer seems like the best option at this stage of the negotiation."
