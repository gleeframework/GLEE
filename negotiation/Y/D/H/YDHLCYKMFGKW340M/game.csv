"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $5,500 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet at $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $7,000? It's a significant price, and I'm ready to make the deal if it works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and $7,000 is closer to what I'm looking for. To make this work for both of us, I'm offering a final counteroffer of $8,000.  I believe this price accurately reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",8000.0,Alice,5,
