This initial offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it also leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a strong offer and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the value I think it's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob within the remaining rounds."
