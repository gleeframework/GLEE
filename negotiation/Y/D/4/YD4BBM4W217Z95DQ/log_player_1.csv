Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my maximum spending limit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This price respects the value you've placed on the product and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this number.

Explanation:

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount John is guaranteed to pay.  There's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting John's offer ensures Alice gets her minimum acceptable price."
