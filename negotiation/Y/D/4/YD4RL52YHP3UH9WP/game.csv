"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $115, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a fair price for this amazing product.",115.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $115 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This would still give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $110. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between $115 and $110, which would be $112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,,
