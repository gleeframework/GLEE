"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 to start. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $70 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I can sell the product to John for $80, guaranteeing my desired profit. There's no need to continue negotiating with Bob at this point."
