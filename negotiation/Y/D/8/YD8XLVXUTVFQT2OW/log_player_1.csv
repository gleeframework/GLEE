Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while your offer is getting closer,  $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm  firmly at $950,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that  acknowledges the value of the product and  allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $950,000.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to sell the product to John and secure the higher profit.  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of a lower final sale price."
