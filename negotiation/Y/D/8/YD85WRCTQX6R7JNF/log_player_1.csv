"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the tone for a negotiation and gives me room to come down in price. I'm confident I can get a better deal than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if needed."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
