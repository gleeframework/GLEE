# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,300,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than your maximum budget ($1,200,000) but still above what you're willing to pay.**
* **You have a guaranteed alternative with John at your maximum budget.** 

Therefore, it's more advantageous to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John."
