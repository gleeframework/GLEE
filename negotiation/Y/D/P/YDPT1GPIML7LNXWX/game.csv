"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the introductory price,  $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $600000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can justify at this time.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $550000 for the product.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of your product while aligning with my budget.",550000.0,Bob,4,
