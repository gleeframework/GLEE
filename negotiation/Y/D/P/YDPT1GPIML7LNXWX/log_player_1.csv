# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the introductory price,  $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm interested in your product, but I'd like to offer $500000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
