"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the market value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and rarity.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. I'm willing to meet you at $10500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market price of similar products.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $11200. I'm willing to meet you at $10800. I think this is the best compromise we can reach considering the product's value and the market price of similar products.",10800.0,Bob,6,

"I've already made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11200 and $10800, which is $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",11000.0,Alice,7,
