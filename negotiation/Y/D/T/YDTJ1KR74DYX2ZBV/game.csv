"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's more than your own valuation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500.  This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit. Let's make a deal.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,500. I'll offer you the product for $15,200. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",15200.0,Alice,5,
