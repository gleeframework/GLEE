Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above $10000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
