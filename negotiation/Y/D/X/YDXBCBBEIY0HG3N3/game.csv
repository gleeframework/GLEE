"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my limit. Can you meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,4,
