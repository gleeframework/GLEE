"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. It's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $18000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $17000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $17000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $18500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,
