"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we try $70? That's a fair offer.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $100?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. To be honest, my budget is $80, how about we split the difference and make it $90?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $90 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, which is $95. How about we try that?",95.0,Alice,7,
