**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some movement, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly more appealing than John's standing offer. Waiting longer risks Bob lowering his offer further or reaching an impasse. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
