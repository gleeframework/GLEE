Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $19,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:**  The $19,000 offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.  
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts, you make a significant profit. If he rejects, you're no worse off, as you can sell to John. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters.  If his counter-offer is too low, don't be afraid to walk away and sell to John."
