Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to offer the product to Bob for less.  
* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at my desired price sets a firm anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I'm aiming for $10,000, there might be a small window for Bob to negotiate if he's highly motivated. This could involve non-monetary incentives or a slightly lower price (though not below John's offer).

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, I have the option to reconsider and make a slightly lower offer, still keeping John's $10,000 offer in mind as my absolute bottom line."
