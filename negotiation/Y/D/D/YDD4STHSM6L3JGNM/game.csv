"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, that price is a bit high for me. How about we come down a bit, say to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. It's clear we're both passionate about this product, so let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. We're getting closer though. How about $1,250,000?  This price is closer to where I need to be to make this worthwhile.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
