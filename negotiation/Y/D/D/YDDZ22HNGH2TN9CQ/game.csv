"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant and goes beyond the $900,000 mark. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't accept anything less than $1,300,000. This revised offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal while acknowledging the true worth of what I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,300,000 offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,100,000 for the product.
