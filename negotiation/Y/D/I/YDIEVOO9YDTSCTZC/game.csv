"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $800,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I've got some flexibility to work with. I can offer you a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. It's a great deal, considering the value this product brings to the table.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which is a fair price given my limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get the product for $825,000. This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Would you consider that price?",825000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $850000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",850000.0,Alice,7,
