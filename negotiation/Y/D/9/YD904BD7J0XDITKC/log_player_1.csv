Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $120. This is significantly higher than my minimum value ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win outcome. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Initial offer is high:**  This allows for more potential bargaining room, giving me a chance to earn a higher price.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer.

I'm confident that this strategy will allow me to maximize my earnings while still being open to a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  His offer of $100 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Potential for lost opportunity:**  If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I'll be stuck selling to John for $80.
* **Time is money:** Accepting the offer allows me to close the deal quickly and move on to other opportunities. 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to earn more,  accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation. The risk of losing the deal and settling for John's lower offer is not worth the potential gain of a few extra dollars."
