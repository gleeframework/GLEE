"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its true value to me. I'm confident this will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's below the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a lower price of $1,200,000, which fits within his budget."
