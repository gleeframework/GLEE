"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $11,000? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you $12,500, which is closer to your offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",12500.0,Alice,5,
