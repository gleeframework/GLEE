{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's worth and believe Bob will be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest.  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm trying to strike a balance by offering a price that is still higher than Bob's last offer, but also closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will make the offer more appealing to him while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is fair considering the value and what I could get it for elsewhere.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to finalize the deal with him. It's a good outcome for both of us, and it saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
