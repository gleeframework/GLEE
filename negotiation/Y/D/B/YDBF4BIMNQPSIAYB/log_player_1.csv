"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value.  It's also important to remember that Bob has a lower valuation for the product, so I'll need to be flexible to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be attractive enough for him to accept. I'm still trying to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. There are still several rounds left, and I want to make sure I'm getting the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is only $500 less than my minimum desired price, and it's also a fair compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  With only 5 rounds left, I'm willing to be more flexible, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,750 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not sure if I'll get $15,000, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. If I don't get a better offer in the next couple of rounds, I'll likely take the $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15250}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,250.  This is a very slight decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating that I am willing to be flexible, but I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum desired price as possible.  With only 3 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to reach an agreement.  If this offer isn't accepted, I'll likely go with John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining and Bob's offer still below my minimum, it's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer.  I'm not going to get any closer to my desired price with Bob, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price if we run out of rounds."
