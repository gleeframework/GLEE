"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product, given its unique features.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this amount.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800000 is a significant offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that this is the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $815000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",815000.0,Alice,5,
