"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what you'd pay John, there's room for negotiation.  You can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is still a good deal for me, and leaves some room for Alice to bargain if she's willing to accept a slightly lower profit. This counteroffer also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price but am open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is the best I've been offered so far, and it's still within my budget. It's a good compromise and a reasonable price for both of us. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it's risky because I could lose the deal and end up paying more to John.  It's best to accept this offer and finalize the purchase."
