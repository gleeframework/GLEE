"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $150 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $120, which is still above your maximum budget of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $100 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This still gives you a great deal on a product worth $150 to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is within my budget of $150 and represents a good deal for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice might be unwilling to go lower. Accepting the offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
