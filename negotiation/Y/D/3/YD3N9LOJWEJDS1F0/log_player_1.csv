Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $150 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and highlights the value Bob will get from the product, making it more likely he'll accept the offer. 
* I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts, giving Bob a chance to counteroffer if he wants.

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximize profit:** I'm starting with a high offer to try and get the best price possible.
* **Maintain flexibility:** By leaving the door open for negotiation, I can adjust my price if Bob counters, and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Secure a backup:** The threat of selling to John for $80 gives me leverage if Bob becomes too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $100 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if I can get closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This still gives you a great deal on a product worth $150 to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't go too far below my desired price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing that even at $110, he's getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer."
