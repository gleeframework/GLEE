"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $550000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account the market conditions and my budget constraints.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the market conditions and budget constraints. However, I'm still willing to make a deal, but I need to adjust the price to reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $575000. This price still represents a significant discount from the original value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",575000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $525000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my financial constraints.",525000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $540000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. What do you think?",540000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, and I'm grateful for the flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $520000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and my financial constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $525000.",520000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $530000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your minimum acceptable price, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $520000. I think this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to buy the product from John for $800000 if we can't come to an agreement.",520000.0,Bob,8,
