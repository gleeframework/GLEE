"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price to give yourself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Aiming for Value:** My goal is to pay significantly less than my maximum budget ($10,000). 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer gives Alice space to counter if she's unwilling to go so low immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Negotiating:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above her value ($8,000) and my target.
* **Room for Improvement:** There's space for further negotiation. Rejecting this offer encourages her to come down further.
* **John as Backup:** I still have the option to buy from John at $10,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $7,800?"",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm doing so slowly. 
* **Targeting Below Value:** My goal is to get the price as close to Alice's value ($8,000) as possible without going over. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer is a good compromise, but I'm still not ready to accept $7,800. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer it to you for $8,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer of $8,200 is only $200 over her known value and a good deal compared to John's $10,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but it also risks Alice becoming frustrated and breaking off the deal.  
* **Time Factor:**  We are past the halfway point of the rounds. While we have time, it's better to secure a good deal now rather than potentially running out of time and being forced to accept a worse offer or buy from John."
