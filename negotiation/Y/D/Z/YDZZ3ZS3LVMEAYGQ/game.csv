"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. Would you consider $10,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. I think this is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,200 is close, but to be fair to both of us, I can't go below $9,800.  This product is truly top-of-the-line, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a worthwhile investment at this price.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $9,400. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",9400.0,Bob,6,
