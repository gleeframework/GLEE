"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, but still above Alice's minimum price. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also helps Bob save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $9,200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $8,750 for the product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again offering a price that's slightly higher than his previous offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway, but still pushing for a lower price. This approach balances being firm in his goal of saving money while not alienating Alice completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $9,100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still focused on saving money and has a good chance of getting a lower price.  While $9,100 is a good deal compared to John's offer,  Bob can likely get closer to his target price of $8,500 with continued negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $9,100 is a better price than before, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $8,850 for the product."", ""product_price"": 8850}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer slightly but still aiming for a price closer to his target.  He's hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $9,050. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently lowering her price, and while $9,050 is still higher than Bob's target, it's a much better deal than buying from John. There's a good chance that Alice will not be willing to go lower, and with only a few rounds left, it's more likely to get a better deal by accepting the offer."
