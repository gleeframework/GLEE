Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, but still lower than my absolute minimum.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while also ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm hoping to entice Bob with a potentially good deal, but I'm not giving away the farm just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not desperate to make a deal at his price. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my target price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not yet willing to sell for this amount. I'll continue to counteroffer in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding out for a slightly higher price. We are getting closer to a deal, and I want to see if Bob will compromise a little more.  I'm also considering that if we don't reach an agreement, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
