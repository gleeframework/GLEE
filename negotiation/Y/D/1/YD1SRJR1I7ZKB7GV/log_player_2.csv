"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I think it's a fair compromise and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower and it's getting too close to John's offer.  It's time to cut bait and secure the $800,000 price with John."
