Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a positive note. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** By starting at a higher price, there is more room for negotiation and potential to get closer to your minimum of $15,000.
* **Avoids immediate rejection:** While $12,000 is above Bob's value, it's not so high that he'll immediately reject the offer. It leaves space for him to counter, which keeps the negotiation alive.
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  By stating a specific price, it gives Bob a clear idea of your expectations and sets the framework for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?  I think that would be a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would lead to a significant loss.
* **Moving to a counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to make a counteroffer that might be more favorable.  

**Strategy:**

The goal is to find a compromise that benefits both parties.  Rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer shows I'm serious about getting a fair price, and opens the door for further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This price is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Positive message:** The message is positive and encouraging, emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal and encouraging Bob to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiating position:**  By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I show that I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Find a middle ground:** The price is a compromise that could be appealing to Bob while still being profitable for me. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:** The positive message aims to encourage further discussion and hopefully lead to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price of $15,000, selling to him is the most profitable option. 

**Why this is the best decision:**

* **Maximizing profit:** Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible profit, which aligns with my goal of earning as much as I can for the product. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continued negotiations with Bob may lead to a lower price or a prolonged process, risking a lost sale or a lower profit.
* **Protecting my minimum value:**  By selling to John, I ensure that I'm not settling for a price below my minimum threshold. 

While I would prefer to make a profit closer to $15,000, this decision prioritizes maximizing my income while ensuring a sale."
