"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?  I think that would be a fair deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to make this work!",11000.0,Alice,3,
