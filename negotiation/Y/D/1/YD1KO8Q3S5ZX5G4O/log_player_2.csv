"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than your initial estimate. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down further or proceed with your backup plan and save $150,000."
