Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit and me a significant saving. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
 
 While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. There are still rounds left, so I want to see if we can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us,  allowing you a good profit while providing me a significant saving. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I have more rounds left and I want to see if we can close the deal closer to my initial offer."

Round 5
