Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate but I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a higher offer."

Round 3

You have three options:

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  I'm getting closer to my desired price but I need to try and push for a higher amount."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,625? This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm already giving up some of my profit."", ""product_price"": 8625}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $8,550. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, I've reached a point where the potential gains of further negotiation are not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. $8,550 is a good compromise, and I can still make a decent profit on the sale."
