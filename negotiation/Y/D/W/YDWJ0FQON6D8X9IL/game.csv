"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $8,500. How about $8,750? This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a price closer to my valuation of the product. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,625? This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm already giving up some of my profit.",8625.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $8,550. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",8550.0,Bob,6,
