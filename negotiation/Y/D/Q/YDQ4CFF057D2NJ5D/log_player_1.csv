This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also frames the deal in a positive light, focusing on the opportunity and value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still below your desired range.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to achieve.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to consider $1,125,000 as a counteroffer. This price still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point,  $1,125,000 is a good price, very close to your desired range, and it's likely you won't be able to get a much better offer from Bob.  Accepting his offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
