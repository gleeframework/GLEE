"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a lower price, getting closer to her $80 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Alice's Valuation:** We know Alice values the product at $80, so we want to aim our offer close to that.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $85 leaves some wiggle room for Alice to counter, potentially meeting in the middle for a price beneficial to both of us. 
* **Avoiding Extreme Lowballs:** While a very low offer might tempt fate, it could also offend Alice and make her less willing to negotiate. This offer is a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $92 is a reasonable price, significantly lower than John's $120 offer and closer to Alice's valuation. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing further could make Alice withdraw from the negotiation, forcing us to buy from John at a higher price.  
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting this offer secures a good deal now."
