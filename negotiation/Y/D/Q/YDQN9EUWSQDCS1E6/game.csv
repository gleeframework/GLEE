"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the $900,000 offer is a significant gap from my minimum.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product's potential.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your previous offer of $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $975,000, which is still a significant compromise from my initial target of $800,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations is still significant.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,012,500. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product offers.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
