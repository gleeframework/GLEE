"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I know you've been interested in, at a price that's still below its true value to you. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice is leaving room for negotiation.** Her message implies she's willing to go lower. 
* **You have a fallback option.** John's offer of $1,200,000 gives you leverage.

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  There's a good chance she'll come back with a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
