"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further.  While Alice is offering a good price, it's still above his desired price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than what you value the product at.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not ready to let it go for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's now able to purchase the product for $1,075,000, which is still under his $1,200,000 budget and a good deal compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
