"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than what you value the product at.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not ready to let it go for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
