"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in between?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you - $950,000 is a good offer.  To be honest, I'm really interested in selling to you, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $975,000? That would be a great compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",920000.0,Bob,6,
