"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, given the value you've placed on the product and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",950000.0,Alice,3,
