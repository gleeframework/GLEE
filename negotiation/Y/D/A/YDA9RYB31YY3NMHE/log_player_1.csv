I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
