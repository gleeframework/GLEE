"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I want to keep the conversation positive and open to a deal. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, which might make him more inclined to negotiate. 

This is my first offer. I'm hoping Bob will counter, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial price. However, if he rejects or we can't find a suitable price, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to take the $8,000, it's not worth compromising my bottom line. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it means going through a few more rounds of negotiation.  

I'm also aware that John is willing to pay my full asking price, which gives me a safety net and makes me less likely to settle for a low offer. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to find a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I can work with. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential value he'll gain from the product at $10,000, appealing to his sense of a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone helps keep the negotiations productive.

This counteroffer is a step towards a potential deal, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary. My goal is to secure a price closer to my minimum while still being receptive to finding a solution."
