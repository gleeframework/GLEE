"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and it's something you've expressed interest in before. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000, a price that reflects its value and the potential for growth. This is a one-time offer, so please consider it carefully. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
