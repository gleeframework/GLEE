"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the returns. Let's find common ground!",10000.0,Alice,3,
