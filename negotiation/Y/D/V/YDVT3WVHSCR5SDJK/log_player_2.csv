# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming to buy the product for $100 or less, and $115 is above your target.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $110 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. John is offering the product for $100, so you have a solid benchmark to work with."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with, especially since John is willing to sell it to me for $100. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
