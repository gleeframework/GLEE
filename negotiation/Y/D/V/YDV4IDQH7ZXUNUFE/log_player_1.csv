Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  The price of $11,500 allows for potential negotiation from both sides. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price and a sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll carefully consider his counteroffer, aiming to maximize my profit while still making the deal appealing to Bob.
* **If negotiations stall:** I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. That's my top price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I could accept Bob's offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He's shown interest, and I might be able to get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always sell to John for $12,000, which is my fallback position.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  I will try to find a compromise that is both acceptable to Bob and still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $11,200.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway while still staying above my minimum price.  The offer of $11,200 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to reinforce his desire to acquire it. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John.
* **If negotiations stall:** I'll sell to John for $12,000 to ensure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is a fair compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer of $11,200 and his previous offer of $10,500. 
* **Close to My Target:**  While it's not my ideal price, $11,000 is significantly closer to my target than his previous offers.  
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks delaying the sale and potentially losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 

**Next Steps:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a decent price while avoiding further negotiation that might be time-consuming and potentially unsuccessful."
