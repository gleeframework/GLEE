Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe its value speaks for itself, so I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the value, the message hints at the product's worth by saying, ""I believe its value speaks for itself."" This creates a sense of desirability.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Bob knows you have other options (selling to John), but framing it as a ""pre-listing"" offer adds a sense of exclusivity and urgency.

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the $19,000, you have room to come down while still staying above your $12,000 minimum."
