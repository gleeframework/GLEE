Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $800,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth more to me to continue negotiating.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $800,000 is simply not viable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a significant discount from my original offer. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

$950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give it away.  I'll try to push for a higher price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

$1,050,000 is still not a price that I'm happy with. I'm not going to give up so easily.  I'll try to push for a higher price."

I'm running out of time, and Bob is not budging on his offer.  It's better to sell to John and get the guaranteed $1,500,000."
