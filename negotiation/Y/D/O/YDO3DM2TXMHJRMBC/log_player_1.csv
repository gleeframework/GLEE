Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate its value, my budget allows me to only offer $1,600,000 for the product. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm confident this product can bring significant value to your operations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $1,700,000. I would like to propose $1,650,000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a reasonable price. While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to go up to $1,660,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits to our business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,660,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,660,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and is now above our fallback option of $1,500,000 from John. Accepting at $1,660,000 secures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
