Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.

Explanation:  While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to go below $8,000.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it's better to take that deal now than risk Alice not budging further."
