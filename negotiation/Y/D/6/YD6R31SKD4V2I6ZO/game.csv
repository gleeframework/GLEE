,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $140 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $155?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",155.0,Bob,4,
