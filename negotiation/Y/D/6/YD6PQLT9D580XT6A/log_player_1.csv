{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so $9,500 is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You're leaving some room to potentially lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're comfortable selling for at least $10,000, so you're not starting too low.

By starting high, you create the opportunity to negotiate down to a price that's more favorable to you, without immediately ruling out a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,500 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're interested, let me know."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  John is a reliable buyer and offers a significantly better price, but I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if Bob will meet me halfway."
