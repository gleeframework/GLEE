This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close to Bob's maximum value as possible while still exceeding my minimum.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my target price.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000.  This price still allows for a significant profit for me, while also remaining attractive for you. Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,100,000, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still a good deal. It significantly exceeds my minimum of $800,000 and is getting closer to the desired price.  I'm confident I can leverage this deal to potentially make even more in the future."
