"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still be a good deal for you, considering your own value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a good price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal fairly.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you a significant profit. Let's reach a deal and close this negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,4,
