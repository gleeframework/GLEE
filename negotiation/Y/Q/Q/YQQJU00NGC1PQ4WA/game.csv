"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $10,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Bob,4,
