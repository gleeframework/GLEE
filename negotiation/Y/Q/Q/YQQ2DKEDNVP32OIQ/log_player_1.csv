"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob seems firmly set at $850,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable.  Selling to John guarantees I make my minimum."
