"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,300,000 is far beyond his budget, and he can get the product for significantly cheaper from John.  There's no reason to even make a counteroffer yet, as John's offer is already within Bob's budget."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,100,000 is a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the product from John for $800,000, so there's no reason to accept anything more."
