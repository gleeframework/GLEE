"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is less than the price from John, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strategic move to test the waters and see how willing Alice is to negotiate.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved up slightly from her initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Bob has 7 rounds left and can continue to negotiate. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and could lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer to $1,200,000, which is still below Alice's current offer but closer to her perceived value of the product. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about making a deal and is willing to meet her halfway.  It's likely that Alice will either accept this offer or counter with a price closer to this one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer again, making it less attractive.  Bob has only 5 rounds left.  It's still worth continuing to negotiate because a deal with Alice could be more advantageous than buying from John.  By rejecting, Bob can attempt to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a reluctance to come down in price.  Bob is getting close to the point where buying from John might become the better option.  This counteroffer represents a slight increase from the previous offer, but it's still below Alice's current price. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about making a deal and is willing to compromise.  It's a good middle ground to see if Alice is ready to come down further.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to seriously consider his options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial point in the negotiation. Alice is not budging much, and Bob is running out of time. Only three rounds remain.  While Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price with Alice, the risk is too high. If he rejects this offer, Alice might increase her price again, or even stop negotiations altogether.  At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John for $1,500,000. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids any further potential risks of losing the deal with Alice."
