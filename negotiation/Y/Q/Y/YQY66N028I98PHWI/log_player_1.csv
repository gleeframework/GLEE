Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation of the product, but lower than your minimum acceptable price. It gives Bob some room to negotiate and potentially agree to a price that is mutually beneficial.  If he rejects, you can still sell to John for $15,000, so you have nothing to lose by offering this price to Bob."
