"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than the $150 John is asking, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth negotiating with Alice further to see if you can get the price down closer to your $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but are also aiming for a fair price.  You're hoping she'll accept this offer, but you're prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price but still a bit too high. You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product, but you are trying to save as much money as possible. Therefore, it is worth rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice has lowered her price. By offering $115, you're demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget. It's a reasonable offer that hopefully bridges the gap between your desired price and Alice's."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $130, which is within your budget. While you'd prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of her walking away or you having to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible decision to secure the product at a reasonable cost."
