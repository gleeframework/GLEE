"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, your starting price is a bit higher than I can currently afford. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects my budget and the importance I place on this product. I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. How about $1,600,000? This reflects the substantial value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective. While I acknowledge the product's value, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This reflects a fair compromise, considering my budget and the potential benefit of this product. I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,450,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,525,000. This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget. Let's make this deal happen!",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $1,525,000 is still just outside my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. Let's close this deal!",1500000.0,Bob,6,
