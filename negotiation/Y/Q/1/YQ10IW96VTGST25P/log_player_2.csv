Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  To be honest, I'm really close to accepting another offer for this product. However, I believe in this product and I'd like to see it in your hands.  How about we meet in the middle again at $13,750?  This is a fair price, and it will allow me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say?
