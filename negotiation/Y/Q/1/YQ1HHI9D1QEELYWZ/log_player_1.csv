Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $135 is higher than the $120 Bob values the product at, so he has an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still getting a profit of $15, which is better than selling to John for $150.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price up or down depending on Bob's response and how eager you are to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than your minimum of $150 and even your initial offer of $135.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your value:** You're not willing to sell for less than $150, so rejecting the offer is crucial.
* **Continue negotiating:**  You can use this opportunity to counteroffer and potentially find a price closer to your desired range.
* **Explore your options:** If Bob doesn't budge, you can still sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $120? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Meet Bob halfway:** $120 is a compromise between your initial offer of $135 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Maintain a reasonable profit:** You're still getting a profit of $30, which is better than selling to John for $150. 
* **Show flexibility:** You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, which could encourage Bob to come closer to your desired price."
