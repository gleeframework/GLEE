"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $8,000, and Alice is offering the product at $8,000, there's no advantage to buying from Alice. He can get the product for the same price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open for potentially getting a better deal later on."
