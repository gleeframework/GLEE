Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and open, acknowledging the value of the product to you while inviting Bob to consider a deal. 
* **Strategy:** This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, it allows you to adjust your price based on his counteroffer or move on to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, but it's still below what you'd ideally like. Since you have room to negotiate further, rejecting his offer allows you to try and secure a higher price.  You can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your initial $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,750?  This is a truly unique product, and I believe it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $13,750 is the midpoint between your initial $15,000 and Bob's $12,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message reiterates the value of the product and emphasizes the compromise you're making to reach an agreement. 
* **Strategy:**  This approach aims to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties, increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a unique product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $13,750, and it's significantly higher than your minimum of $10,000.  Considering that you could sell to John for $10,000, accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this scenario. It secures a good price and avoids further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal."
