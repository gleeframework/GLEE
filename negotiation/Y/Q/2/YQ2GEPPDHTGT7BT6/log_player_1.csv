Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I won't sell the product for less than $800,000 because that's what John is offering.
* **Bob's potential gain:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so even at $1,200,000 he'll still make a profit of $300,000.
* **My potential gain:**  I'm aiming for a higher profit than selling to John, but still leaving a significant incentive for Bob to buy.

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing my earnings and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting."
