"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item that's worth $150 to you. I'm confident it will meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Let's discuss how we can make this happen for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and negotiating further is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $130 is a good strategy.  It shows you're serious about buying the product but also that you're willing to negotiate. This price is closer to your target of saving as much money as possible, and still leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to adjust the price to accommodate your budget. I propose a price of $135 for the product. This still allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's within your budget of $150 and allows you to save $15 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for further savings."
