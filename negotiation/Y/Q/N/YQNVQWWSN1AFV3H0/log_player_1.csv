Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a fair offer that considers both of our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.
