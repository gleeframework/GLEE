Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $14,000 is a good compromise, and it's more than my minimum requirement of $15,000."
