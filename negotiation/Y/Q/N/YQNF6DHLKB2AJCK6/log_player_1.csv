Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, but there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as a good deal or a unique opportunity.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit. However, there's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer, and you'd have to sell it to John at the base price."
