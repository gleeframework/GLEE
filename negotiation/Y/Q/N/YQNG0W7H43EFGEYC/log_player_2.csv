"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you, and a very profitable sale for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet halfway on this.
