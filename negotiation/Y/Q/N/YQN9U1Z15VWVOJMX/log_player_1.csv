Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest and counteroffer accordingly.  Remember, I have John as a backup at $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows him that I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm not giving up on my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just slightly below my initial asking price, but it's still a good profit for me and above my minimum. It's likely we won't get a better offer from Bob, so I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale."
