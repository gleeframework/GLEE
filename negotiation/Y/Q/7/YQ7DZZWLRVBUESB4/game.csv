"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it might bring to my business. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,800,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the value of the product.  While $1,800,000 represents a fair valuation, I understand your constraints. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this price point reflects the product's worth while still offering you significant value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
