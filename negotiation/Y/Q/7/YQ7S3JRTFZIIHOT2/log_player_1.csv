Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible while still ensuring a profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $135 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the chance of a sale.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing we have John as a backup at $150 gives us leverage. We don't need to go below our minimum.

This strategy aims to secure a sale above our minimum while acknowledging Bob's valuation and potential willingness to negotiate."
