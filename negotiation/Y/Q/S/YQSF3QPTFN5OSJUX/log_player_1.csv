"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum value, I'm not eager to sell at that price right away. There are still 9 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering a price of $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and close the deal."
