"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1400000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1250000.  I believe this product is valuable to me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  Let's aim for $1275000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come away satisfied.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1290000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1290000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.
