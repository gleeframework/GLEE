"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's desired price point. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance to get a better deal, and Bob has 9 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,250,000.  I believe this product is valuable to me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his desired price point.  He can likely still negotiate a lower price, and with 7 rounds remaining, there's time to continue exploring a better deal.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is only a viable option if all else fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  Let's aim for $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1290000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1290000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While $1,290,000 is a good price and Alice has stated it's her lowest, Bob has 5 rounds left to negotiate. He can likely still get a slightly better deal. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is only a viable option if all else fails."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm determined to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your firm stance, I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement at $1,280,000. This would be a good compromise, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to still make a respectable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1290000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1285000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Alice's offer of $1,285,000 is very close to Bob's desired price point and a good compromise.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of rejecting and failing to reach a deal with Alice is increasing.
* **Alternative Cost:**  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is a significantly higher cost, making Alice's offer the more attractive option.

Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's still beneficial to Bob, minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation and a more expensive alternative."
