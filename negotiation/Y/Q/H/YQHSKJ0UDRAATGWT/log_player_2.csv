"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than his maximum budget of $150, there's still room to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $115 is closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate lower.  Rejecting the offer allows him another round to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $110? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now at $112.50.**  This is only $2.50 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $110.
* **It's close to Bob's ideal price:** While Bob might prefer to pay even less, it's likely he's nearing the point where further negotiation will be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly better deal.
* **The risk of going to John:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice will counter with a higher price, or they'll stall the negotiation. Going to John would cost him $150, significantly more than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $112.50 is the most sensible choice, considering the potential for a better deal is low, and going to John carries a higher cost."
