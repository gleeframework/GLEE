"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm clearly stating that I'm willing to negotiate,  making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** $12,000 is above my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate a higher price, especially since we have 8 rounds left. 
* **Assessing Bob's interest:**  By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how committed he is to buying the product. If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter with a higher offer.

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $14,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not too far. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm framing the price as a fair compromise to make it more appealing. 
* **Emphasizing the value:**  I'm reinforcing the idea that Bob is getting a good deal. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $14,000 is still above my minimum, giving me some wiggle room if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $14000. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to my minimum:**  $13,000 is only $3,000 away from my initial offer, which is a good compromise. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  We are in round 4, and we're getting closer to the point where we might run out of rounds. Selling to John for $10,000 is still an option, but I don't want to take that risk yet.
* **Bob's commitment:** Bob's counteroffer shows he is committed to buying the product, and we are getting closer to an agreement. 

It's worth accepting Bob's offer at this point to secure a sale and avoid losing the deal."
