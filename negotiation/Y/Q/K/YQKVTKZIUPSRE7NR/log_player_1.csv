Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * You earn $150,000 more than your guaranteed price.
    * Bob saves $50,000 compared to its value to him ($1,000,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value.

**Important Note:** This assumes you want to conclude the deal quickly. A more drawn-out negotiation might yield a slightly higher price from Bob, but risks him declining and accepting the guaranteed offer from John."
