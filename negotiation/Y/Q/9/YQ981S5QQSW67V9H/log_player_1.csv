Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? I think that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
