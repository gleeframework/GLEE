"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is better than Alice's current offer."
