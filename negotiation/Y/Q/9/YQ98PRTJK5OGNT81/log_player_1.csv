{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but still leaves a good profit margin. It's also a price that's above Bob's perceived value, so he might be willing to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and direct, establishing a reasonable offer and leaving space for Bob to respond. 

**Why this strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** This price gives Bob room to negotiate without immediately feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 
* **Potential Counteroffer:** It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and this allows me to adjust my price further if needed. 
* **Alternative:** If Bob rejects, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a major loss.
* **Negotiation:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to drop my price drastically this early.
* **Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value.
* **Message:**  I reiterate my understanding of Bob's constraints, but also emphasize the value of the product. This helps to frame my counteroffer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties.

**Why this strategy:**

* **Negotiation:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also sets a clear lower limit for my price.
* **Potential Compromise:**  $1,000,000 is a middle ground that could lead to a successful agreement.
* **Alternative:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to either make another counteroffer or sell to John for my minimum value."
