You should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or simply buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm happy to offer you $900,000, which is a good middle ground and allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $950,000 for the product.  This offer is fair to both of us and lets us finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down significantly, $950,000 is still more than you want to pay.  Since you can buy the product from John for $800,000, that's the best option. You'll save $150,000 by going with John."
