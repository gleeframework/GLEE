"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm happy to offer you $900,000, which is a good middle ground and allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $950,000 for the product.  This offer is fair to both of us and lets us finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
