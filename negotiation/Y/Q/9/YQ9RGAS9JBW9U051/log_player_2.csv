"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110.  You can likely get a better price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price.  $105 is closer to your ideal price, but you can likely squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further! I'm still a little hesitant at $105.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $102.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $102.50 is a good deal for you. You're still getting the product for well below your maximum price of $150, and you're likely not going to get a significantly better offer."
