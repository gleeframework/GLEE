"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $900,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, demonstrating your intent to negotiate aggressively while still remaining within your budget.  It's likely Alice will counter, but it sets a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is still within your budget, it's not the best deal. You're better off continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a price closer to your ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

You're now offering Alice her minimum acceptable price. This shows you're serious about buying the product but are still pushing for a fair deal. It's likely Alice will accept this offer, but if not, you have the option to buy from John as a fallback."
