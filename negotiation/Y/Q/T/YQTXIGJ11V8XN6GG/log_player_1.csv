I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. 

It's down to the wire, and with only two rounds left, the negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a price that's high enough for me.  It's a tough decision, but John is offering a secure deal at my minimum price, and I want to guarantee I get at least $800,000."
