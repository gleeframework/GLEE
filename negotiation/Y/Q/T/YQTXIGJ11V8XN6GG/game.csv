"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for everyone.  My initial offer is $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm very interested in the product, but I have a limited budget for this purchase. Can we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come away satisfied. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $775,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500? This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $812,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $795,000 just isn't enough for me. It's important that I receive a fair value for this product. I'm willing to go down to $805,000, which is a small compromise on my end.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.  What do you say?",805000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair value, but $805,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $797,500. Can you consider that price?",797500.0,Bob,8,
