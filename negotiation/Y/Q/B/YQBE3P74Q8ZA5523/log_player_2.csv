The product is worth no more than $120 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly lower. There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject and try to get a better price."

``` 

Alice's offer is back to the initial price of $65. You've already rejected this price once, and her counteroffers are getting closer to your initial counteroffer. This suggests she might be firm on the price, and there's a chance you could get stuck in a cycle of counteroffers.  

Given that you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $120, it's a better strategy to buy from John. You can still save $55 compared to your maximum budget."
