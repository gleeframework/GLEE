Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to the value I see in the product? I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is still too low, and I'm confident we can get a better price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,400,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is just too low. How about $1,350,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can reach a compromise. How about we aim for $1,325,000? This still allows me to save some money compared to what I value the product at, while providing you with a fair profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to what I'd like, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,325,000 is still not quite where I need to be.
