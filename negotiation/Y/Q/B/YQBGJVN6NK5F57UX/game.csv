"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $13,500 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $12,500.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to consider $13,200, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a little too high at $13,200.  I'm willing to go to $12,800.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",12800.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you $13,400. This is my final offer, and if you don't accept, I'll have to consider selling to John.",13400.0,Alice,7,
