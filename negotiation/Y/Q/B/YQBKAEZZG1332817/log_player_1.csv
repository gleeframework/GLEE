Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,500,000.  It's the highest I can go. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, Bob is firm on his valuation and it matches John's offer. It's better to secure the deal now at a price I'm comfortable with than risk prolonging negotiations and potentially losing both offers."
