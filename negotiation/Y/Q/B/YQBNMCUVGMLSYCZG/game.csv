"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $825,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and should still be attractive to you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can offer at this time. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm confident that it's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
