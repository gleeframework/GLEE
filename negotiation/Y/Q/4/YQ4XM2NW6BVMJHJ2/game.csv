"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $9200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal at $8800.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
