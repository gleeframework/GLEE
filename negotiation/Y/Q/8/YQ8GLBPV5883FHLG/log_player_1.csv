"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is far too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this price will be more appealing to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $160. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still staying above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
