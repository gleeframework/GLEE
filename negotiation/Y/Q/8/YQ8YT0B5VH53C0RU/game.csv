"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8200 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9000?  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest,  $8500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8750. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. ",8750.0,Alice,5,
