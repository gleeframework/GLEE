"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $12500?  That's still a fair price for a valuable piece like this, and it fits within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I believe the product is worth more than $12500, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit outside of my range. Would you consider $13000?  This would be a great deal for both of us and allow me to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
