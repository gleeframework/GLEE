"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll see what counteroffer he makes and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind that John is always a safe bet at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $14,000 is better than John's offer, but I think I can still push for more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for me. It's more than what John is offering, and it's only slightly less than what I countered with in the previous round.  I'm happy to close the deal here and avoid further negotiation."
