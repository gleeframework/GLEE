"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. It's a bit high, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible while still enticing Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also reinforces my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $10,750. That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. I have 6 rounds left and John is a solid back-up option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's split the difference again and try $11,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering a price that is very close to my minimum value, but still a bit higher than Bob's offer. This shows I am serious about getting a deal, but I am not willing to compromise below my minimum value."
