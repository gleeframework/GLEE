You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,500. Since I can get the product for $10,000 from John, it's more efficient to take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
