"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $8000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I can buy it from John for the same amount.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I'm still not sure that's enough for me to consider selling. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and the fact that you're a serious buyer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still above my budget. I can go as high as $9000 for the product, but I'm not comfortable going any higher. This is a fair price that considers your needs and allows for a smooth transaction.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be fair, but $9000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000, which is the lowest price I can accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
