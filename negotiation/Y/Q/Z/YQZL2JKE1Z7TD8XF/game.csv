"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $120. I think this price is reasonable, considering my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to get a good price, but $120 is still too low for me. How about $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,5,
