"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way too high,  it's more than double what the product is worth to Bob. Rejecting the offer and counteroffering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1,100,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to make a good profit and me to acquire the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  I'm willing to be flexible, but  $1,100,000 wouldn't allow me to make the kind of deal I'm looking for. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can reach a price within Bob's budget.  The offer from John is always a fallback option, but it's better to continue negotiating with Alice to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
