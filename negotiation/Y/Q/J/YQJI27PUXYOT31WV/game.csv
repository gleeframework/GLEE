"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product!  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I know it aligns perfectly with your needs.  I'm confident it will bring immense value to your business. My initial price is $900,000.  I believe it's a fair price given the product's worth, but I'm open to discussing it further. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? I think this price is still fair considering the immense value the product brings, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward!",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $775,000? I think this price is reasonable and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $775,000 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's close this deal!",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try $800,000? I think this price is reasonable and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm getting close to considering buying from John, but I'd like to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,6,
