You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but you're still paying more than you ideally want.  Let's see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $700,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

Alice has come down a bit, and $725,000 is a good price. It's still below my ideal target, but it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with John's higher price."
