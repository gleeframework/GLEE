"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, considering the product's value and potential returns, I'm not willing to go as low as $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1950000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. If this offer is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1875000.0,Alice,5,
