"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, it gives him incentive to negotiate.  I'm confident I can make a profit, and we can potentially work towards a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,500.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum and closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and gives me a decent profit. It also avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
