"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better deal than $1,100,000.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice values the product at $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. It's a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her value for the product, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation:** This initial counteroffer signals your willingness to negotiate and aims to start a back-and-forth that could lead to a more favorable price for you.
* **Strategic advantage:** By offering a lower price, you put pressure on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which still reflects the significant value this product holds for you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is still above your target price but getting closer to it.
* **Potential Savings:**  Buying from Alice at $1,050,000 saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will become unwilling to sell at a price you are willing to pay, or that you will waste too much time negotiating and potentially miss out on other opportunities.

**Conclusion:** It is in your best interest to accept Alice's offer at $1,050,000, as it offers a significant saving compared to buying from John while still ensuring you get the product you desire."
