**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to wear me down, but he's still offering more than my fallback option of John. I'm going to hold firm for now and see if he'll come up further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on the price. I'm willing to let it go for $10,750, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $10,625 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly still very interested and is making small concessions.  While I'd prefer more, taking the $10,625 is a reasonable gain over my guaranteed $10,000 with John.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk him walking away in the last two rounds."
