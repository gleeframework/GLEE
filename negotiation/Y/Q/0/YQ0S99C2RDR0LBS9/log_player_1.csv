Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can we meet at this price?

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches John's standing offer, it's strategically better to sell to John at this point. Bob has shown a pattern of incremental increases, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price. Accepting John's offer guarantees the desired profit without the risk of prolonged negotiation."
