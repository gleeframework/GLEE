Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,000,000 for the product, as that's what John is offering.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm aiming for a high initial offer, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit. A price of $1,400,000 is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum and leaves potential for Bob to counteroffer without losing too much value. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm aiming for a high sale price.
* **Stay open to negotiation:** The offer is not my final price, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Protect my minimum:** I'm not risking losing a sale by starting too low and potentially being stuck with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000 and still leaves a decent profit margin for Bob.
* **My goal:** I aim for a higher price, as I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer:** While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I prefer to continue negotiating with Bob, as I have more leverage to increase the price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Show Bob that I am not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Potentially increase the price:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Avoid selling to John:**  I can potentially get a better price from Bob than from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous offer:**  Bob rejected my $1,400,000 offer, demonstrating a willingness to pay less.
* **Bob's counteroffer:** Bob offered $1,200,000, which is still a good profit for me, but I believe I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm offering a compromise price of $1,300,000. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still a decent profit for me. This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a reasonable price.

This approach aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  The counteroffer bridges the gap between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Increase my profit:**  While it's a lower price than my initial offer, it's still a considerable profit for me.
* **Show flexibility:**  Demonstrating a willingness to compromise increases the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
