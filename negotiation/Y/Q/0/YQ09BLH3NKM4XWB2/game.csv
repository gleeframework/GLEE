"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $135 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Would you do $120? It's a fair offer for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $120 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Let's compromise at $125. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
