{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. My initial offer is $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum price of $80. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about $85?  It's still a fair price for both of us, and it lets us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still not quite there at $85.  Let's split the difference and go with $80.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Even though it's my minimum price, it's better than selling to John for the same price and I'm avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
