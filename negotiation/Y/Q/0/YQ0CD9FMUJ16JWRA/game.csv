"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about $85?  It's still a fair price for both of us, and it lets us both walk away happy.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still not quite there at $85.  Let's split the difference and go with $80.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",80.0,Bob,4,
