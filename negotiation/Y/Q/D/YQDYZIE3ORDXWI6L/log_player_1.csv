Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring I get more than my guaranteed sale to John.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message aims to be positive and frame the price as a ""deal,"" potentially influencing Bob's perception of the value."
