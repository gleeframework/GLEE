Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value and this offer reflects that."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value your product highly.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high price will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His reaction will guide my next move. 
* **Fallback Option:** I always have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests he's interested and willing to potentially pay more. 

I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I value your offer, $10,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  Could you do $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial offer ($22,000) and am now closer to the middle ground between my starting point and Bob's offer.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving me some bargaining power. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This will gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's willing to negotiate further, it indicates we might reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $12,500 remains below my absolute minimum of $15,000. 
* **John is a Guarantee:** I know I have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000.  It's getting close to the point where continuing to negotiate with Bob might not yield a significantly better result.

I'll make one more counteroffer that's closer to my minimum, but if Bob doesn't meet it, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go any lower than $14,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear to Bob that this is my absolute bottom line.
* **Close to Minimum:** $14,000 is just slightly below my guaranteed sale price with John, but it leaves a small margin for potential profit from Bob.
* **Decision Point:**  This counteroffer will force Bob to make a decision. It's a fair compromise, and if he declines, I'll move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $14,000. I'd be willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's final offer of $13,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is ready to pay my full asking price.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further lowering my price without any guarantee of success. It's more efficient to take the sure thing with John."
