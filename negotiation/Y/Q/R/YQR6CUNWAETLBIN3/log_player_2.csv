"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're aiming for a price closer to $80, and $100 is still too high. You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

You should offer $85. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing your serious intent to buy while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $95 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to negotiate further. You have rounds left, and there's a good chance Alice will come down further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

You should offer $90. This is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing you are willing to compromise. It also leaves room for Alice to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. You're getting closer to your ideal price, and it's within your budget. Continuing to negotiate might take more rounds and you risk reaching a point where you have to buy from John for $80.  It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher price than to risk getting a worse deal later."
