"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable.  Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further. ",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that still reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,075,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
