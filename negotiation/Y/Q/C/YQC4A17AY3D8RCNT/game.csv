"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,800 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
