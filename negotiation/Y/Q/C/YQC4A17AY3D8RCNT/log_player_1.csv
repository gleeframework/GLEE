Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I'll see if I can get Bob to go a little higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Bob. $10,800 is still a little too low for me, but I think I can get him to go a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,800 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
