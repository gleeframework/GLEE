# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to you and my costs, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects a fair balance between what the product is worth to us and what you perceive its value to be. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.
