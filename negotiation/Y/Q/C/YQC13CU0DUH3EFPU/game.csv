"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to you and my costs, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects a fair balance between what the product is worth to us and what you perceive its value to be. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can agree on this.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the product's value. In light of this, I am willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer for the product is $97.50. I believe this price respects the value you place on the product while allowing for a reasonable profit. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",97.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $90. This price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement on this.",90.0,Bob,4,
