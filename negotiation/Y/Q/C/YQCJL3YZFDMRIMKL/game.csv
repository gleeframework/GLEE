"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its value to me. This price is fair and allows for some room for negotiation.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite low considering the true value of this product.  Could we meet in the middle at $18,000?  I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you at that price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $15,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while also acknowledging its value.",15000.0,Bob,4,
