"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $10,500? That's a significant discount from my original price and a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product.  While I understand your budget constraints,  $9,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession,  how about $10,000? This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
