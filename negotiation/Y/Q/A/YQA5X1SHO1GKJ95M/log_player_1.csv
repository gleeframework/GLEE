Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it, but I am looking to stay within my budget. My counteroffer for the product is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a higher price. It's unlikely Bob will go significantly above $1,500,000, and we risk him walking away altogether. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
