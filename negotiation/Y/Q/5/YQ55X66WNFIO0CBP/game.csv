"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my final offer. This reflects the true value I see in this product, and it's a price I believe is fair considering its worth to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
