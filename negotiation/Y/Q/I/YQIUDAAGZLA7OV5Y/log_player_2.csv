"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500? This is a good deal for both of us and allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $12,000 as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer, there's still room to negotiate further.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
