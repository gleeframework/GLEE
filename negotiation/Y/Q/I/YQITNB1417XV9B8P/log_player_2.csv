Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I initially offered, but still a bit lower. How about $1600000? I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm open to negotiations.

While $1,600,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my limit. I will try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a price closer to my target."

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  It's the best I can do within my budget."
