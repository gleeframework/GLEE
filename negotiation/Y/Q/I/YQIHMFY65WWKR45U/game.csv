"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my valuation, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
