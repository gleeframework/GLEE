(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer is way too high.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I can get it from John for $1,200,000, so I'll keep trying to negotiate with Alice.  I'll try to get closer to my budget."
