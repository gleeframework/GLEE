Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high offer will help me understand how serious Bob is about the product. His response will reveal how much he values it and how much he's willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $1,200,000. Let's start there.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is his perceived value, it's significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** I can use the next round to further highlight the product's worth and justify a higher price.
* **Negotiate Towards a Better Deal:**  I have room to come down from my initial offer while still aiming for a price above Bob's valuation and closer to my own.
* **Maintain the Option of John:**  I don't want to settle for a low price prematurely when I have a guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I've come down considerably from my initial offer, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Bob's Valuation:** The new price of $1,800,000 remains significantly above Bob's stated budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message reinforces the product's value, justifying the higher price point.  
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While I'm open to negotiation, this counteroffer keeps me in a strong position. I'm willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of this product, and it's closer to my budget.  I believe this is a good starting point for us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 now matches what I can get from John. There's no financial benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob or waiting for a potentially better offer.
* **Saves Time and Effort:** Accepting this offer provides a clean and immediate close to the negotiation, saving time and effort that could be spent on other deals.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to push Bob slightly higher, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of him walking away. Accepting a guaranteed $1,500,000 is the most logical decision at this point."
