"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point.  While I'm interested in the product,  $900000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750000?  I'm confident this price allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $750000. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850000. I'm still a bit out of my comfort zone at that price point.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go to $800000. This demonstrates my genuine interest in the product and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway at $800000. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession to get to a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
