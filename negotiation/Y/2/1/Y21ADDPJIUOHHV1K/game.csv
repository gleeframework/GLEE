"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is my best price for now.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I still think $10,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final counteroffer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your time. I'm willing to go up slightly to $10,500, but that's my absolute limit.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my last offer.",12000.0,Alice,7,
