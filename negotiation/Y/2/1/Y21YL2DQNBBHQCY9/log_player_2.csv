"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $120 is less than $150.
* **You can still save money:**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is selling it for $120. This means you're getting a good deal."
