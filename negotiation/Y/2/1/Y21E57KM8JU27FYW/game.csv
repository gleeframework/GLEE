,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $700,000 for the product. I'm looking to make a significant saving, and I believe this price is more reasonable considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make a significant saving to justify the purchase.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase. Let's find a middle ground. How about $875,000? That's a substantial reduction on my end, demonstrating my willingness to work with you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to make a significant saving to justify the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,6,
