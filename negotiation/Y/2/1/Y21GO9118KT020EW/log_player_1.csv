Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's enough space between your offer and Bob's perceived value ($15,000) for both of you to potentially find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **It's bold:** It shows you're confident in the value of your product and not afraid to ask for a good price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below the desired range.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000.  It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $10,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,200 isn't my ideal price, it's a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
