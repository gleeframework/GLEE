Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're providing, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product for $1500000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I reject Bob's offer because my minimum value for the product is $1,500,000, and Bob is offering the minimum. I want to see if I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,750,000?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,600,000 is a good compromise and above my minimum value. I'm confident I can make a good profit, and it's better than selling to John for $1,500,000."
