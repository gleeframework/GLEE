"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, given the value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking a better deal from John."
