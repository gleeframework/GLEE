Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep the cost below $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $75 is too low for me.  I'm going to try to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your response. I really appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to stick to my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between $85 and $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would have liked to get closer to my original asking price, $82 is a fair compromise and still above my minimum. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell him the product."
