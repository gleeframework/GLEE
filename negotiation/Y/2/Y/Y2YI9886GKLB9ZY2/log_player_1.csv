Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start negotiations high. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, suggesting he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still netting you a profit above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time before you absolutely need to sell to John. If you need an immediate sale, a price closer to $1,200,000 might be more strategic."
