# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you. This price reflects a fair compromise, giving you a substantial profit while still ensuring I receive a fair value for my product. I'm confident this is a win-win proposition. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's $1,500,000. 
* **You still save money:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($1,000,000), you are still getting the product for less than your maximum budget ($1,500,000)."
