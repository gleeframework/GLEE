"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $10000 for it.  This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a discussion. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000.  This price is a good compromise for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction.  Let's finalize this deal!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway just yet, Bob. I'm willing to come down to $13000, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
