Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can get at least $120 from John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit to $115. This is still above Bob's offer, but I'm hoping to reach a compromise.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to meet me in the middle.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum desired price of $120."
