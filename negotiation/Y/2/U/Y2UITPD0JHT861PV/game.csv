"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?  That's a fair offer considering the value and it works for my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $8,500. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to reach a reasonable price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
