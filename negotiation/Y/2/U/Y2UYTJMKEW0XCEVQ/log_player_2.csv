Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $900,000. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that you're serious about purchasing the product. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. Let's try $850,000. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $800,000, which is $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $825,000. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**  

While Alice is slowly coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach $800,000 in the remaining rounds. She's very committed to getting a price above $800,000. At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for my maximum price makes the most sense."
