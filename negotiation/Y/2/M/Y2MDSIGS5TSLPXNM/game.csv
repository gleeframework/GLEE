"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500, reflecting the value of the product.  This is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  $7,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,5,
