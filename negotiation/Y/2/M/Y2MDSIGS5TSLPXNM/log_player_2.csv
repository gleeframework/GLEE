"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is above my maximum budget. It makes sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?"", ""product_price"": 7000} 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to get a sense of Alice's flexibility. There's a good chance she'll counter, giving me more room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500, reflecting the value of the product.  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but she's still above my target price. I'll counter again, moving closer to my limit but leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 7750}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting a price exactly between our previous offers can signal a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Strategic Positioning:** While this counteroffer is closer to my budget, it leaves me some room to negotiate further if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  $7,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Alice's price reduction is smaller this time, indicating she might be nearing her bottom line. 
* **Alternative Option:** John's offer is only $250 away. It's getting to the point where the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of Alice not budging further. 

I'll make one more counteroffer, pushing closer to my limit. If Alice doesn't accept, it's probably time to go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you've been great to work with, but I have to be mindful of my budget.  My final offer is $7,900. If that works, we have a deal!"", ""product_price"": 7900}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signal:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to convey urgency and limit further back-and-forth. 
* **Small Concession:** I'm only increasing my offer by $150, signaling I'm getting close to my limit.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  If Alice rejects this, I'm ready to buy from John for $8,000. The potential savings aren't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
