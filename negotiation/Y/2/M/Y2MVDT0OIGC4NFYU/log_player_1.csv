Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language to make the offer appealing.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I emphasize the value of the product to make the price seem more justifiable. 

This strategy aims to get Bob to counteroffer, giving me a chance to find a price point within the $80-$100 range that benefits both of us. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($100).  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Seeking a Higher Price:**  While selling to John for $100 is a safe option, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  
* **Testing Bob's Limits:**  By rejecting his offer, I can see if he's willing to increase his offer further. 

My next counteroffer will aim to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. It's definitely closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about $95?  That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Persuasion:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to secure a higher price. 
* **Mutual Benefit Emphasis:** I highlight that my counteroffer is a ""great deal for both of us."" This frames the price as a win-win situation.
* **Positive Language:** I maintain a positive tone, making the negotiation feel collaborative.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping my goal of getting a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really don't want to go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Risk:** Bob has consistently refused to budge above $90.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a $100 profit, which is my minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could waste time and potentially lead to a lower price or no sale at all.

While I'd prefer to make a higher profit, it's more important to secure a sale that meets my minimum requirements."
