"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which still gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $12000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and settle on $11500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
