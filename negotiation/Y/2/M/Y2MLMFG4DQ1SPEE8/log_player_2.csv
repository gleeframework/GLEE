**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000, which is lower than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:**  While you are paying more than the product's worth to you ($1,000,000), you're still saving $50,000 compared to buying from John."
