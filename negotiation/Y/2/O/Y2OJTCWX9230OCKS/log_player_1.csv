Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I leave the door open for counteroffers, showing flexibility and willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll likely counter with a slightly reduced price, keeping in mind my minimum value of $1,500,000 from John. 
* If negotiations stall, I can always choose to sell to John for my guaranteed minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and my desired price. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer and continuing the dialogue.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, but the potential for a higher price with Bob is still worth pursuing. 

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,250,000. I'll use this opportunity to reiterate the value of the product and highlight any benefits Bob might be missing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While your offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $1,150,000. This shows willingness to negotiate and find a solution. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, highlighting the potential benefits he'd gain from the deal.
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a positive tone and use language that emphasizes collaboration and finding a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Avoiding the ""John"" option:** At this point, it's still beneficial to continue negotiating with Bob, as I am confident I can get a higher price than $1,100,000.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts this counteroffer, the transaction is complete.
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. 
* If I make another counteroffer, it will likely be closer to his offer of $1,100,000. I'll be cautious about making too many concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,125,000? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,100,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a higher price, but the risk is that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Compromise:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and accepting his offer signals a collaborative approach.

**Next steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and complete the transaction. While I would have preferred a higher price, this is a satisfactory outcome given the circumstances."
