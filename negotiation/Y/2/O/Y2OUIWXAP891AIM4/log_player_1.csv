Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you for $18,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire [brief, enticing description of the product and its benefits to Bob]. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we start higher to explore potential profit.  $18,000 is a significant markup but not so high as to be immediately dismissed without consideration.
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:** The message includes a brief, positive description to remind Bob of the product's value and his potential need for it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?"") inviting Bob to counter-offer and start a negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, agreeable), you might adjust the initial offer and message accordingly.
* **Market Context:**  If the product is in high demand or has limited availability, a higher initial offer might be justified. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the door open for a successful sale to Bob."
