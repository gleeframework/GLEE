"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $105. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $102.50? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Bob,4,
