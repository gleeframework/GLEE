"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable about the price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $15,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $13,750 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to meet you halfway, $13,750 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $14,500. This is my final offer, as I'm confident the product is worth it. Let me know your decision.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not willing to pay $14,500. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
