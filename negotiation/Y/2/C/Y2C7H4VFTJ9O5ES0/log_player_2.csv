``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum price, it's still beneficial to see if you can get a better deal.  There's potential for a counteroffer to get a lower price, saving you some money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if it's something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $975,000, which is a significant drop from her original price and puts us closer to our goal of saving as much money as possible. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will either raise the price again or become less willing to negotiate further.  Accepting this offer secures a purchase for a good price, especially considering the alternative is paying $1,000,000 from John."
