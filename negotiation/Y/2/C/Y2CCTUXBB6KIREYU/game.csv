"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while you get a great deal on a valuable product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the middle ground you're trying to find, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,500, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
