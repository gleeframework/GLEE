Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a good starting point.
* **Being friendly:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $14,000 is a good starting point for negotiations, allowing for a potential counteroffer and still making a good profit.
* **Plan B:**  I'm ready to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:**  While $12,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $14,000.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, increasing my chances of a better deal. 
* **Not desperate:**  I'm not desperate for a sale, as I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the flexibility to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while you get a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob (a great deal) and the fairness of the price, making it more appealing.
* **Still profitable:**  $13,000 is still a decent profit for me and keeps me closer to my goal. 
* **Encouraging acceptance:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the middle ground you're trying to find, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,500, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:**  While $11,500 is below my initial target, it's still a decent profit and a significant improvement over selling to John for $10,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance that Bob will walk away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer of $10,000.
* **Potential for future business:**  Even though I'm accepting a lower price, building a positive relationship with Bob could lead to future business opportunities.

It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at a reasonable price than risk losing the deal entirely and settling for a lower offer from John."
