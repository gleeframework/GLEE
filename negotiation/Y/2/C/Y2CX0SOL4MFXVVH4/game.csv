"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the quality and features of the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $11500 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to meet me at $11000, but I'm still a bit away from my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $11500 is too low, so I'll go to $11250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",11250.0,Alice,5,
