Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching a stalemate. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **John as Backup:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer yields an extra $100,000."
