"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it to you at $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Building Rapport:** The message is friendly and focuses on the product's value to Bob, creating a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 
* **Option to go with John:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a large loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I can still counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price with Bob.
* **John is a backup:**  I have the option to sell to John for a much better price, which keeps me in a strong negotiating position.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $9,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time.  Considering the value of the product and its potential benefit to you, I believe a price of $11,000 would be a fair compromise.  This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffering Strategically:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not completely rejecting him. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Staying Firm on Value:** $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility without compromising too much on my minimum price.
* **Highlighting Potential Benefits:**  I remind Bob of the product's potential value to him, reinforcing the idea that it's a worthwhile investment.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, giving me more rounds to potentially reach a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to take a significant loss at this point.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, which indicates that further negotiation is possible.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, which gives me leverage in the negotiation.

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise with a Purpose:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $11,000 to $11,500. This demonstrates that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Meeting in the Middle (sort of):**  $11,500 is closer to Bob's offer than my previous one, but still significantly above his last offer. 
* **Finality and Urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""make this deal happen"" to subtly imply that this might be my final offer. This puts pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining Option:**  I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.  

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be accepted. If not, I'm prepared to counteroffer again in the next round while keeping John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $11,250 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is becoming more flexible, so there's potential to reach a better price in the next round. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer.

I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer! I'm willing to go down to $11,400. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.  Let's close this deal, I know we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, only $100 lower than my last offer. This demonstrates continued flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Emphasize Fair Price:** I remind Bob that the price is fair considering the value of the product.
* **Positive and Motivating:**  I use phrases like ""getting closer"" and ""close this deal"" to create a sense of progress and encourage Bob to accept.
* **John's Offer Remains:** I'm aware of John's offer, which keeps me in a strong negotiating position.

This counteroffer aims to convince Bob to accept while still preserving my chance to secure a better price if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We're down to the final rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offers are still below my desired price point.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me a significantly higher profit than accepting Bob's latest offer.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk that he won't budge further, or that the negotiation could drag on without a successful outcome.

While I would like to maximize my profits, it's important to be practical and secure a deal that meets my minimum expectations. Selling to John is the most logical choice at this point."
