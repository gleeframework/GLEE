"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a great asset to your business. I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This gives you a significant advantage over acquiring it elsewhere, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,
