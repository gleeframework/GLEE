"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a great asset to your business. I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This gives you a significant advantage over acquiring it elsewhere, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum valuation of $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or resort to buying from John for a guaranteed lower price."
