Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you.,130.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal considering the value it brings to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle again at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. It's still a good price considering the value it brings to you.",105.0,Alice,5,
