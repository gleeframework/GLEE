Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum desired price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message creates a more agreeable atmosphere for negotiations. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  Bob is likely to counteroffer, and I'm prepared for that.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150. Accepting it would be a loss for me.
* **Opportunity to counteroffer:** I can still try to negotiate with Bob and get closer to my target price. 
* **Selling to John is an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $150.

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. That would be a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still being above my minimum desired price.
* **Justification:** I'm offering a reason for my price, emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion if Bob is still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130, but that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While $130 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below it. Selling for this price would be a significant loss.
* **John is a safer option:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might lead to an even lower price. 
* **Potential for stalemate:** Continued negotiations with Bob might lead to a stalemate, wasting time and potentially losing the sale to someone else.

I'll choose to sell the product to John to ensure a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $135. That's a fair price considering the quality of the product and what other buyers are willing to pay.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with justification:** I'm still rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate further. I'm providing a justification for my counteroffer based on the product's quality and the market.
* **Strategic compromise:**  $135 is only $5 higher than Bob's last offer,  demonstrating a genuine desire to reach a deal. This might encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **No ""final offer"" language:** I'm leaving room for further negotiations if Bob isn't satisfied. 

I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $127.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $127.50 is still below my minimum desired price of $150. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John for $150 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that could lead to a lower price.
* **Negotiations might stall:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate, wasting time and possibly losing the sale altogether.

I'm choosing to sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
