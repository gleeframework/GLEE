"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. You should definitely reject this and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. The goal is to see how much Alice is willing to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the value it brings while still acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $1,400,000 is still more than you need to spend. You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, I believe."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We're aiming to get the price as close to John's offer ($1,200,000) as possible without losing the deal.
* This counteroffer shows a willingness to move significantly from your initial offer while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* By framing it as a ""good deal for both of us,"" you maintain a positive tone and encourage Alice to consider your perspective."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a workable range, it's still a significant gap from what I have in mind. Let's try $1,250,000. This price reflects the value it brings while recognizing we're both making concessions to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is unlikely to budge much further. Her latest offer of $1,250,000 is only slightly above John's price of $1,200,000. 
* Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a slightly better deal, but it also risks her pulling out or the negotiations stalling. 
* It's more strategic to take John's offer now, securing the product at a reasonable price. You've successfully negotiated Alice down significantly, but the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
