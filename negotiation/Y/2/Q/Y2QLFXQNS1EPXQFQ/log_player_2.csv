"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

* **It's within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that. 
* **You're saving money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $30 compared to buying from John."
