"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,500.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a higher price from him. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal. However, it's still a good price for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price.  I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob, but I'd rather try than settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $8,500. This is a big compromise from my initial offer, but I still believe I can get a higher price than John's offer.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's becoming clear that I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum acceptable price."
