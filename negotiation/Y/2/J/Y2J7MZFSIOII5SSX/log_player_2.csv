Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a price closer to $90.  We have time to negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $100, and we're getting close to that point. Accepting at $102 is a good deal and saves us $18 compared to John's price."
