Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better outcome. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the offer seriously.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's beneficial for both parties but still above our minimum."
