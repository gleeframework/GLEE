"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I understand the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm looking for at least $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $1,212,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1212500}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer or ending up with no deal at all.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $1,200,000."
