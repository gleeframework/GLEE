Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be of great value to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we want to get as close to that as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning that you'll offer it elsewhere creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly, making him less likely to overthink or lowball a counter-offer."
