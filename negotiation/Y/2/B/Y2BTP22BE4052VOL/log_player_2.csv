Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's already gotten Alice down to $9,000, and he's still within his budget.  He should counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to his $8,000 target."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. While he could continue negotiating with Alice, it seems she's firm at $9,200. This is beyond his $8,000 goal, and John offers a better deal.  It's time to cut his losses and move on."
