"Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$600,000 is a significant discount from $1,000,000, but it's still unknown how much Alice values the product.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly narrow the gap. A $400,000 price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. This aggressive approach might encourage Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially getting closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by lowering her price from $600,000 to $500,000.  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $450,000, hoping to meet her halfway. This shows I'm serious about getting the product but still value saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $475,000 is a good deal considering the potential to save $525,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it's becoming increasingly risky to continue. Accepting the offer ensures a good deal and avoids the potential for a breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
