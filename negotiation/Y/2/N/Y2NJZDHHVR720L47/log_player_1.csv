Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) who will pay $1,000,000.
* **Potential Gain:** By offering $1,500,000, I'm aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for Bob to potentially perceive value in the deal.
* **Risk Assessment:**  There is a risk Bob might reject the offer, but I'm comfortable with that risk because I have John's offer as a safety net.

By offering a price higher than John's offer, I'm incentivizing Bob to consider buying the product. This strategy increases my potential profit while minimizing the risk of not finding a buyer."
