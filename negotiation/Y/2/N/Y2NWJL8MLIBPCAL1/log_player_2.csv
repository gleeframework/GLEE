"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$85 is a good price, but you're trying to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $70 is a reasonable starting point.  It's a significant discount from Alice's original offer, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy from there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a little closer to your counteroffer, but $80 is still above your desired price. We can continue to negotiate and hopefully get her down to something closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so we'll continue to push for a lower price. Offering $75 is a small increase from our previous offer, but it's still a significant discount from Alice's original price. We'll see if this is enough to convince her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than our desired price, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again gives us the opportunity to see if we can get her down to something closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $82 is closer to our desired price, but we're still trying to save as much as possible.  Offering $78 is a compromise that shows we're serious about buying the product, but we're also not willing to give up too much.  We'll see if this is enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $84 is getting closer to her original price, and we've already gone back and forth several times.  We've reached a point where the potential savings are not worth the continued negotiation.  It's better to buy the product from John at $150 to avoid further delays and potential stalemate with Alice."
