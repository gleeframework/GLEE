"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really value. I'm offering it to you for $135. This is a good deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it below market value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Your value:** $150
* **Alice's offer:** $135
* **John's price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price and you risk losing the deal entirely."
