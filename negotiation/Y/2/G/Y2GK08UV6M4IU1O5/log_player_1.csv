Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $8,000 minimum. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still go up if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $12,000 is significantly less than the $15,000 value to him, leaving him a good profit margin. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly less than what you'd like to get.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value and hopefully reach a more agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows you're not willing to settle for his initial price.
* **Is still lower than your original offer:**  It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate.
* **Offers a fair compromise:**  It splits the difference, showing you're open to a solution that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you initially aimed for a higher price, $10,250 is a good deal.  It's close to your desired value, and rejecting it might lead to further negotiation, potentially dropping the price further. Accepting it allows you to close the deal and secure a good profit without risking further haggling."
