{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still reasonable.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers.  It's also a good opening to gauge Bob's interest and his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk further negotiation, especially since I can sell to John for the same amount."
