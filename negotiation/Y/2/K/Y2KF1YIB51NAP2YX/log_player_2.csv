Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm still a bit attached to my initial offer. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?

The product is worth $150 to you and Alice is now offering it for $110, which is within your budget and a good deal.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially having Alice walk away or you ending up buying from John for a higher price."
