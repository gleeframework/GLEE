"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a good price for you, considering its value. Let's see if we can make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high. How about $14,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",14500.0,Bob,4,
