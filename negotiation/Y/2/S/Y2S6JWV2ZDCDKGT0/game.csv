"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $140. I'm willing to meet you at $130, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $130. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",135.0,Alice,5,
