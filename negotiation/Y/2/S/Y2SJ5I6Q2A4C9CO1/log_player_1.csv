Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,100,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly less than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  Highlighting that the price is below Bob's perceived value could incentivize him to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Back-up Option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 provides leverage in case negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I can still potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher number.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still represents a great deal for you, as it's below your perceived value. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price at this level."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Reaffirming Value:**  I emphasize that $1,000,000 is still a good deal for Bob based on his perceived value. 
* **Reiterating Negotiation:** I reiterate that I'm open to negotiation but have set a clear lower limit.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By refusing to go below $1,000,000, I am signaling that I'm serious about getting a fair price and have a fallback option with John."
