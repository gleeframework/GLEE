Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from him.  Therefore, I'm accepting his offer."
