"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room to negotiate further as Alice values the product at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value you mentioned, I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counter-offer of $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's $1,000 less than John's offer and only $1,000 more than Bob's desired price point.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart, and Bob might end up paying John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids further risk."
