"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still higher than Alice's value of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and I'm eager to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $11,000:**  This is closer to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000 and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering could lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away.  At this point, the risk of losing the deal is higher than the potential reward of a few hundred dollars in savings.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and require more time and energy. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product quickly and move on."
