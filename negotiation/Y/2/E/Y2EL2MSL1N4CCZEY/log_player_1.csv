Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum value:**  I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so I want to earn more than that.
* **Potential profit:**  By offering $15,000, I am aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for Bob to potentially negotiate.
* **Risk assessment:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $12,000.  This minimizes my risk of not selling the product.

By offering a price higher than my minimum but still within a reasonable range, I am increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer while also maximizing my potential earnings."
