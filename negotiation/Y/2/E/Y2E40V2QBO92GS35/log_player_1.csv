This offer represents a significant discount from my minimum price, showing willingness to negotiate while still securing a reasonable profit. It leaves room for potential counteroffers, allowing for a dynamic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far too low to be considered. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, it's significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the highest I can go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away entirely or further lowering his offer is too high. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
