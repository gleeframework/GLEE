"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you say to a price of $200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $120. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still too high for me. My final offer is $130. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with John."", ""product_price"": 130}
