"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This price is closer to my maximum budget of $8,000, while also acknowledging that Alice likely won't accept this price immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate further. I'm hoping Alice will continue to lower her price as the rounds progress.  It's worth exploring more negotiation options before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice and avoid going all the way to my maximum. By demonstrating a willingness to compromise, I might be able to close the deal sooner."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and while it's still above my desired $8,000, it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid further negotiations.  If I continue to negotiate and Alice rejects my counteroffer, I risk ending up with a higher price than this. Additionally, we're already at Round 5, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds and having to buy from John at his price."
