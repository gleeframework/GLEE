Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a good starting point to maximize my potential profit. I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to meet my price. If not, I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still allows me to make a profit. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $160. This is a further compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and finally accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I don't think I can get any more out of him. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
