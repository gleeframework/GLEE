Round 2

Round 6

**Reasoning:** We are getting close to John's offer, but Bob is still moving up in his offers.  There's a chance we can push him a bit further in the next few rounds to get closer to our desired price."

**Reasoning:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, and while it's close to John's offer, it's unlikely Bob will bridge that gap in the remaining two rounds.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
