Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  By starting at $150, I set a high anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $150 is a good starting price, I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone helps build rapport with Bob. 
* **Backup plan:** I can always fall back to selling to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There's still a chance Bob might be willing to pay more.
* **Negotiation is key:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $125? It's still a good deal, and it would help me make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price to $125. 
* **Appeal to value:** I'm highlighting that $125 is still a good deal, implying that the product is worth more.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair price for both of us. 
* **Maintain room for negotiation:**  While $125 is closer to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my minimum price of $100.
* **Opportunity cost:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that he'll walk away or that I'll end up selling to John for $100 anyway. 
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and I'm likely to get a better price by accepting Bob's offer now."
