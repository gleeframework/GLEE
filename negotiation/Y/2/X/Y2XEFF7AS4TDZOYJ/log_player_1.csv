"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is a strong opening offer that shows I value the product and am confident in its worth. It also gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  

I want to see if Bob is seriously interested in purchasing at a higher price.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $900,000, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a price that I believe reflects the value of the product while also being within a reasonable range for Bob. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired value and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not where I want it to be. I believe I can get closer to my desired value with further negotiation.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm countering with $1,150,000. This is a smaller increment than before, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still want a fair price. 

With each round, I'm getting closer to my goal while also making it clear to Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product. This counteroffer should push Bob to consider accepting, but it also gives me a little room to negotiate if he chooses to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally close enough to my desired value. While I would love to push for a higher price, there is a risk that he will reject my counteroffer and we'll be stuck in a stalemate. With only 4 rounds left,  selling to John for $1,000,000 is no longer a better alternative. Therefore, I will accept his offer and sell the product for $1,125,000."
