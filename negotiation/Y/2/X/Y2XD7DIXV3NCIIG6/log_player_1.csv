I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and I'm confident the product is worth at least that to me.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or go with John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,000,000 is far too low for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this shows Bob I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I can get the same amount from John. I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
