"I understand that you've done your research, but I've also done my due diligence and I'm confident that the product is worth more than $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'd be willing to make a decision today if we can meet at that price.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9000. I'm willing to meet you at $8800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about buying from John if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with.",8800.0,Bob,6,
