"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you.  My starting price is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still confident this product is worth more than $950,000 to you. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a very fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $925,000 still doesn't reflect the true value this product holds for you.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant drop from my last offer, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is the same as my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to stand by it.",925000.0,Bob,8,
