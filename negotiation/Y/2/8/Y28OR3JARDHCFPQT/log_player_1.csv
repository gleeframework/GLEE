Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than what I had in mind. This product holds a certain value for me, and I'm prepared to offer $600,000. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering it's significantly more than half your initial asking price.
