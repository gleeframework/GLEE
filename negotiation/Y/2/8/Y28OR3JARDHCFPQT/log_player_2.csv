"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering it's significantly more than half your initial asking price."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway again. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing hardball and is unlikely to go substantially lower than $950,000. While she claims it's her final offer, there's still room for negotiation, but it's getting risky. Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees you stay within your budget and avoids the uncertainty of further haggling with Alice."
