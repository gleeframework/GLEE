Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a profit. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which might encourage Bob to accept my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $90. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell it for less than my minimum value of $100. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $98? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $98 is very close to my minimum value of $100. It's better than selling to John for $100, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept the offer."
