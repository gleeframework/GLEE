"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $900,000? It's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's try to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear your offer and appreciate the negotiation. To be honest, $890,000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal work. Would you consider $910,000?
