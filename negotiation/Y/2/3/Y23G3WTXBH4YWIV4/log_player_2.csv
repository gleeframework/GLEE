"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $6,500 is a good price, but Bob can likely do better.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000.  By rejecting, Bob can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a strong counteroffer.  He's aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to get a better deal.  This first counteroffer shows his serious interest in the product while setting a low baseline for further negotiations.  He's aiming to get a price closer to his $12,000 limit but also wants to leave room for negotiation in case Alice's bottom line is higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $6,000 is a good price, Bob should reject Alice's offer again. He has already shown his willingness to negotiate and knows Alice is willing to come down from her initial price.  By rejecting, Bob can continue to push for a lower price and potentially get closer to his target.  He still has 7 rounds left and can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round. He's showing flexibility while still trying to keep the price below $6,000.  He's gauging how much Alice is willing to compromise and is strategically working towards a price closer to his target while leaving room for negotiation. He's trying to find a sweet spot where Alice might accept and he gets a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $6,200, which is a fair price considering Bob's initial target was $12,000.  He has already made significant progress in the negotiation, and accepting this offer saves him $5,800 compared to buying from John.  While there's still room for negotiation, it's not clear that Alice will go lower, and risking further rounds might lead to a higher price or a failed negotiation altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing out completely."
