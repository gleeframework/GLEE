"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget, however, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle on $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
