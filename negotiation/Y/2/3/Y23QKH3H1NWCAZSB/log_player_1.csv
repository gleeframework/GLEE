Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would that work for you?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget, however, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle on $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise.
