{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price again, and while it's still slightly above her own valuation, it's a good deal for us. We're getting the product for a price that's significantly lower than what we'd pay John, and we're still saving money. It's time to accept this offer and close the deal."
