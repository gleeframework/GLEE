"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, and I think this is a fair compromise.",12800.0,Bob,4,
