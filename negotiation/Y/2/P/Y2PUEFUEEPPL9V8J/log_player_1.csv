"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets your minimum, you still have room for negotiation. You're aiming to maximize your profit, so it's worth exploring if you can secure a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, and I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is close to your initial counteroffer of $13,500. Accepting this offer will get you a better price than selling to John, and it seems like a fair compromise given Bob's budget constraints."
