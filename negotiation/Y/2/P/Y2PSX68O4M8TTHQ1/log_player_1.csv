Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This strategy allows me to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can then consider lowering my price slightly or going to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or, in the worst-case scenario, sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a price that's closer to my desired value than his last offer. I believe this price is attractive enough to incentivize Bob to accept, but not so low that I'm losing out on a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of going back and forth further with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price is not worth it.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired value, which is the best outcome at this point."
