"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value for you at $15,000. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I am offering you the opportunity to own it at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an exclusive offer tailored to recognize your interest and commitment. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's a risk she might refuse and you'd end up paying more to John."
