"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the unique qualities of the product. However, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $9000 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to offer $10500, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $11200. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
