"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $95. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $98, which is my lowest price point. I'm confident that this is a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
