Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum price of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's room for you to potentially get a higher price. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** You don't want to scare Bob off right away with a super high price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $110 is still above your minimum price of $100, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lower the price.  It's better to take the offer now and secure a good deal."
