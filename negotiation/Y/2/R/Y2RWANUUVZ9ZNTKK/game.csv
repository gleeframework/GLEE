"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about $1,300,000? This allows for a good profit for you and keeps me within a reasonable range. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. However, I want to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,275,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,275,000 is still below my minimum. I'm committed to finding a solution, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $1,325,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I truly believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Please consider this final offer.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
