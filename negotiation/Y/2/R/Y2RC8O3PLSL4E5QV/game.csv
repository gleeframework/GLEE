"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted rate.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $108. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",108.0,Alice,5,
