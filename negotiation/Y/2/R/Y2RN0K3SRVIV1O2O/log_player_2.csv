* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Buying from Alice at $950,000 saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **It's within Bob's budget:** The price is within Bob's $1,200,000 limit.
* **Alice is still getting a profit:** Alice is selling for $950,000 and values the product at $800,000, so she makes a profit of $150,000."
