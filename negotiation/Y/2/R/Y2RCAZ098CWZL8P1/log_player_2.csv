Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he would prefer to pay less, Alice has come down significantly from her original price and is getting closer to Bob's desired price point. It's likely that Alice won't come down further, and Bob risks losing the product entirely if he rejects the offer.  He also risks having to purchase from John at a much higher price."
