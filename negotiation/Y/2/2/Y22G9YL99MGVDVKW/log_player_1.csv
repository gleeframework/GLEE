Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for negotiation.  I believe he'll be willing to pay more, considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to him."
