"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $925,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion.  What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it, and it leaves room for both of us to make a profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle - how about $890,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",890000.0,Alice,3,
