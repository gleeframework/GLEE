Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it will be a valuable asset. I'm asking for $1,300,000 for it, reflecting its high quality and potential. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value of similar products. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,150,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation.  I have several rounds left, and selling to John is always an option if I can't get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher, and I believe its potential benefit to you warrants a price closer to $1,250,000. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. Let's continue to explore options and see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations and willing to work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing a deal by pushing for more, especially since I have the option to sell to John for the same price."
