Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher, and I believe its potential benefit to you warrants a price closer to $1,250,000. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. Let's continue to explore options and see if we can bridge the gap.
