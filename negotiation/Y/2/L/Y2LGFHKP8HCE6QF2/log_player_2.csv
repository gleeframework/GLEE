"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, and I maximize my return.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  The goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This still gives you a good return and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is still a great deal for you as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than John's offer of $1,500,000, and it's still a good deal for Bob.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
