Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $14,500."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.  
* **Time Value:** While Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John, selling it quickly to Bob has its own value. 

This strategy balances getting a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
