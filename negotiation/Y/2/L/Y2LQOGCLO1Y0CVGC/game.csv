"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $11,500 for it.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $12,500? That's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
