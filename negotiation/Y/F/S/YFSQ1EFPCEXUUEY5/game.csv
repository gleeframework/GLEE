"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $750,000 is a significant undervaluation of what this product can do, I'm willing to move closer to your number. How about we consider $1,300,000? I believe this reflects the true value while still offering you a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
