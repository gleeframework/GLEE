{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer, offering a price that's lower than Alice's initial price but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable value.  This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is within Bob's budget and only a small amount more than Bob's initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiations."
