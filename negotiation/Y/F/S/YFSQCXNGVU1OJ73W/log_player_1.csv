"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for some wiggle room. It's also important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating but also that I won't settle for anything significantly below my worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $14,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can push for a bit more. I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still within a reasonable range.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on, but I'm not willing to give up too much at this point."
