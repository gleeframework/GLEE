"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've had other interested buyers and I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,750. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $11,250. This is a fair price that's closer to what I can afford, and it's still above your value for the product. Let's try to close this deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've had to turn down other offers for this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to make one more concession to $11,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
