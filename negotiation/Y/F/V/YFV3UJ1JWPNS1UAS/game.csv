,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let's work together to make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too far off from what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, at $975,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
