"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which is a very fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. $200 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It also leaves room to increase the offer later while staying well below my $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is too low for me.  Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still way too high.  Time to inch my offer up a little, but I'm still prepared to walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice, but $140 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere, say around $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm raising my offer, but still aiming for a price well below Alice's desired amount.  This keeps the negotiation moving while making it clear I'm serious about getting a good deal."
