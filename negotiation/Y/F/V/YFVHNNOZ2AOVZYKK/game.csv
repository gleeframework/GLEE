"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential benefits for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of your counteroffer, I am willing to consider a compromise. Therefore, I am proposing a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair balance between the intrinsic value of the product to you and my need to maximize the return on my investment. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still slightly above what I'm comfortable with.  To make this deal work, I'm prepared to offer $1,280,000.  This represents a significant savings for me, and still leaves a healthy margin for you. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise.",1280000.0,Bob,4,
