Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you'd be happy with $100 from John, there's a chance to get $99 from Bob, which is almost the maximum you can earn.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $99 is just above Bob's perceived value. It creates a sense of urgency and potential loss aversion (""missing out on a deal"").
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially get even closer to your desired price.

Let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer!"
