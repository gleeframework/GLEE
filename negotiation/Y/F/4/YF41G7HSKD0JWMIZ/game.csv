I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it?,150.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,130.0
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,125.0
"I like your suggestion to split the difference, but I was thinking more along the lines of $128. That way, I can still make a bit of a profit, but also meet you in the middle. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,5,,
