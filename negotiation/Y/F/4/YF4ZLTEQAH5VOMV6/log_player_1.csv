{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum value of $10,000, meaning you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $11,500 is below Bob's maximum value of $12,000, giving him room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for back-and-forth without immediately hitting your floor price or Bob's ceiling price.

By starting with a reasonable offer, you set the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is still above your minimum acceptable price, it's significantly below your initial offer of $11,500.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, you show that you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Potentially get closer to your desired price:**  A counteroffer gives you the opportunity to nudge Bob back towards your initial price point.

**Next Step:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than $9,500 but lower than $11,500. This allows for continued negotiation and a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is my absolute minimum. It's still a good price for you, considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  This counteroffer is above Bob's offer but still below your initial offer.  It demonstrates flexibility while maintaining your desired profit margin.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message highlights the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing his incentive to close the deal.
* **Clear minimum:** By stating your absolute minimum, you set a firm boundary for the negotiation.

This counteroffer allows for further negotiation and a potential compromise. You've maintained a strong position while giving Bob room to come back with a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is a good deal for you. It's above your minimum of $10,000 and  closer to your desired price. 

While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance that:

* **Bob won't budge further:** He's already moved closer to your desired price and may be reluctant to offer more.
* **You risk losing the deal:** If you keep rejecting, Bob might walk away and you'll have to settle for John's offer of $10,000.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale at a good price without risking a further negotiation that might result in a lower price."
