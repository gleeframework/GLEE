"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $75? That's a fair offer, considering it's closer to my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $110, which is closer to what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  While $110 is closer, I'm trying to keep it under $80. Could you do $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to keep it under $80, but $78 is still a bit low for me. I can do $90, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm getting close to my minimum price, so let's see if we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Alice,7,
