"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high initial price without revealing my hand.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I want Bob to understand I'm willing to negotiate, encouraging him to engage in the process rather than immediately walking away.
* **Alternative Option:**  While I have John as a backup, I want to explore maximizing my profit with Bob before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own stated value ($1,000,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation. Accepting his offer now would be leaving a lot of money on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your offer reflects. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and thanking him for his engagement. 
* **Hold Firm on Value:** I'm reiterating that his initial offer significantly undervalues the product. 
* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial reduction from my initial price ($200,000 decrease), demonstrating flexibility. However, I'm still holding firm well above my absolute minimum and closer to my target price.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message frames this counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" encouraging Bob to meet me closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too rich for me.  How about we split the difference some more and I offer you $1,000,000. That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met his own perceived value for the product. While I could push for a slightly higher price, it's unlikely he'll go much further. Accepting his offer of $1,000,000 gives me a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or potentially losing the deal altogether."
