"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to capture some of Bob's surplus value. I'm confident in the product's value and believe Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value for the product. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I believe this is a fair counteroffer, considering Bob's initial offer, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum, it's getting closer. I'm also aware that I have limited rounds and John is a sure bet for $1,500,000.  It's better to secure a deal now for a slightly lower price than risk losing a sale altogether."
