{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $120 but below my minimum value of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his maximum willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $130. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum of $150.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm going to try to get a bit closer to that $150 mark. It's worth risking another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can do $140.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $135. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum of $150, and it feels like we're going back and forth without getting closer to my desired price.  John is a guaranteed sale at $150, so I'm going to take the sure thing."
