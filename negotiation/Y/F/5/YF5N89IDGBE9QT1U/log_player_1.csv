Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product I think you'll find valuable. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, at least $1,200,000. To be fair, I'm offering it to you first at $1,450,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly worthwhile.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting with a price significantly above that gives room for negotiation and increases your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the shared value  subtly anchors the price in Bob's mind and suggests it's worth the higher price. 
* **Urgency:**  Letting Bob know he has the first opportunity creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if he rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept."
