"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm still not sure if $90 is enough for me. I'm willing to consider a higher price, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $98, which would be $95. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $98 is still a bit too high for me, I'm willing to come up a bit to $96. Let's see if we can close this deal.",96.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $96 and $98, which would be $97. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",97.0,Alice,7,
