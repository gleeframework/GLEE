Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $10,000 is lower than what Bob is willing to pay, making it attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can go higher if Bob counteroffers, or you can accept a lower price if needed. 

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of a successful negotiation while still ensuring you get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still above your minimum of $8,000 and closer to your initial offer of $10,000.  It's a good deal for both of you.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and secures a profit for you."
