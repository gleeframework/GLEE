"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's try to find a compromise here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $9,800 is still a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,200 as a final compromise. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,
