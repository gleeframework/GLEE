"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1500000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a price that I believe is still fair, given the potential benefits it offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking $1450000 is a fair price for this product, considering its value and the market. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I see your point, but $1450000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $1550000? This price reflects a significant compromise on my end and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's work together to find a solution that suits both of our needs.",1550000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking $1400000 is the absolute maximum I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. I believe it's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,6,,
