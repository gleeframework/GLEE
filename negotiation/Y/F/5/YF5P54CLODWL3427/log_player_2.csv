Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my absolute floor, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut your losses. Alice has drawn a line in the sand at $13,000 and seems unlikely to budge. You've gotten her down $5,000, but you have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a downside risk (she could stick to $13,000) and little upside potential (you're unlikely to get much lower)."
