"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I know we're both trying to find a good deal here. While $13,500 is tempting, I have to stick closer to my budget. How about $12,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal with this.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my absolute floor, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13000.0,Alice,7,
