"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum value this product holds for me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is a fair starting point considering the value this product provides. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
