Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $14,000 is less than the value Bob places on the product ($15,000), making it likely he'll consider the offer.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher offer might scare Bob off, so it's better to start a little lower and see where the negotiation goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit high for my budget though. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's not worth it to accept his offer. I'll counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a great deal for you and still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  Could you do $11,500? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's also better than selling to John for $12,000, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
