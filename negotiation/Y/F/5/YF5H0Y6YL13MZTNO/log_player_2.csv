"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1000000 to me, but its true value might be much higher depending on your needs. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant discount considering the potential value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.
