"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1000000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that amount. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're still trying to get the price down, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $975000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering you a compromise at $962500.

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. I'm getting close to considering buying from John, though, so I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're getting close to considering John's offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering you a price of $925000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1200000, and I think you'll regret missing out on this opportunity.",925000.0,Alice,7,
