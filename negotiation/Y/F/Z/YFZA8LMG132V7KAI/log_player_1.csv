Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also need to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation but ensures a significant profit if he accepts.
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. 

**The message strikes a balance between confidence and flexibility, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.**"
