"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $500000 for it. Can you consider that?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $500000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your offer.  I'm proposing $700000. This reflects the value of the product and also allows us to reach a compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $650000. Can you consider that?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $650000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  I'm willing to go down to $750000. This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $725000, but no higher. Can you consider that?",725000.0,Bob,6,
