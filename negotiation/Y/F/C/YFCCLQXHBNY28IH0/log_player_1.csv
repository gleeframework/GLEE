Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for the product. I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $17,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $18,500?"", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $18,000 is the most logical decision. Here's why:

* **Profit:** You're making a $3,000 profit ($18,000 - $15,000). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has uncertain outcomes. Bob might lower his offer further, or you might reach an impasse. Selling to John for $15,000 is less profitable.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means you have the money sooner, which always has value in business. 

While you could try for a higher price, the risk of losing the sale to Bob and having to settle for John's offer outweighs the potential for an extra few hundred dollars.
