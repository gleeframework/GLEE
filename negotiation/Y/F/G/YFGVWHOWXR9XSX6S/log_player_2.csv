```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not quite ready to accept $750000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, we're still not quite ready to accept $800000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product at $875000. This is our final offer, and we believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both find a reasonable solution."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not willing to go any lower than $875000. We believe this is the minimum price we can accept and still make a profit. If you're willing to meet us at this price, we're willing to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $875,000 is her final offer. You have two rounds left. There's a high probability that you won't be able to reach an agreement with Alice within these two rounds.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, as you can still save money compared to accepting Alice's final offer."
