Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My ideal price is $1,200,000, but I know Bob values it lower. 
* **Initial Offer:** Starting at $1,000,000 is a good middle ground. It's a significant discount from my ideal price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I can afford to be more flexible with Bob. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation Power:** I have the advantage because I know John is ready to pay my full asking price. This gives me leverage to push for a better deal.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but not sacrificing too much from my target.
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes that the proposed price is fair to both of us, increasing the chances of acceptance. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value, but showing flexibility to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but we're still a considerable distance apart.  Further negotiation might drag on and could potentially lead to an even lower price.
* **John's Offer:**  John is offering my desired price of $1,200,000.  This is a guaranteed deal that meets my financial goals. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  It's always better to secure a good deal with a reliable buyer than risk a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a less favorable outcome.

**Conclusion:**  Selling to John is the most sensible option in this situation. It guarantees the highest price and avoids the uncertainty and potential loss associated with further negotiation with Bob."
