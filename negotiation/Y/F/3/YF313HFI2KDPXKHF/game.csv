"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price again.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $9,000, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $10,000 feels like a fair price to me. It reflects the value of the product and gives us both a little wiggle room.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200, which is the lowest price I can accept. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",10200.0,Alice,7,
