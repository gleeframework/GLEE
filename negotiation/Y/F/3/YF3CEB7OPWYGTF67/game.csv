"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $850,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000, so how about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
