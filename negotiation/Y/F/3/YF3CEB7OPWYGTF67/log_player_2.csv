# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $850,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
