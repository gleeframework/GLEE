{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for a potential counteroffer from Bob. It also frames the offer as beneficial for both parties, which could encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is above my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $850,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000, so how about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, Bob's offer of $875,000 is still significantly better than selling to John for $800,000. I'm accepting his offer to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
