"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can try to get a better price from Alice since her offer is significantly higher than her value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay as little as possible, so we start with an offer close to Alice's value ($100). This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is friendly and expresses continued interest while clearly stating our price limit. This keeps the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $112.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, the price is still closer to her original offer than ours. There's room for further negotiation before we need to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about we settle at $106?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 106
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving closer to Alice's price in smaller steps, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties. 
* **Staying Below John:** We're still well below John's $150 offer, giving us bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $108. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice won't budge, and we'd end up with John's $150 offer. Accepting $108 guarantees a good price.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting now secures a reasonable deal and lets us move on."
