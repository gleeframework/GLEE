"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:Alice's starting price is too high. The product is only worth $12,000 to her, and I can get it for $15,000 from John. I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower to see if I can get a much better deal. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway. How about we agree on $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: While Alice is coming down, $12,500 is still more than I want to pay. I'll push a bit further down, staying below my maximum budget. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,500. Would that be agreeable to you?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to the product's worth. $12,000 is my absolute lowest price. If you're serious about purchasing it, this is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Reason: This is a great deal! Alice has come down to her product's actual worth to her, and it's well below what I'm willing to pay and significantly less than John's offer.  Time to accept before she changes her mind!
