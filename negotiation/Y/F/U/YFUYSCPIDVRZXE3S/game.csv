"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our continued negotiations. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we could have this conversation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
