# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further, but we're getting closer to the price Jhon is offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we could have this conversation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.

Alice's final offer is still too high. It's time to cut our losses and go with Jhon's offer.  While we would have saved a little more with a lower price, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Jhon is a reliable alternative, and we can secure the product at a price within our budget."
