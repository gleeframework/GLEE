"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is still above what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario while maximizing my profit in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $85. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $90. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $90 is getting closer to my minimum threshold of $120 and I'm running out of time.  It's also a good compromise, and  it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob."
