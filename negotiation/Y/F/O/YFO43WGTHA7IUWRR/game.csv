"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and land at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
