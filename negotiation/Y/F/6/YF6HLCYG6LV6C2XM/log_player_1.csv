Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm asking for $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in his mind.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stated, the message implies reasons for the price (value, demand), which can make it feel more justified to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize potential profit. However, there's always a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. You'll need to weigh the risk of losing him as a buyer against the potential reward of a higher sale price."
