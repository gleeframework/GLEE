"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to acquire the product you want. Let's make this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
