"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way beyond my budget. This product holds value for me, but I'm only willing to consider a price within a realistic range. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet somewhere in the middle; how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards the middle, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for my budget. I can offer $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I want to make this work, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large. To be frank, I have another potential buyer, but I'd prefer to find an agreement with you. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects my desire to close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, and I believe your mention of another buyer is just a tactic. However, while I'm eager to make this work, I need you to be realistic. I can stretch my budget to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I can always buy from John at that price.  Take it or leave it.",800000.0,Bob,6,
