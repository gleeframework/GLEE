"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you leave room for negotiation and gauge his interest level.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence about the product's value is crucial in negotiations, especially when aiming high. 
* **Leaving Room:** This initial offer allows for you to make significant concessions in subsequent rounds while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way beyond my budget. This product holds value for me, but I'm only willing to consider a price within a realistic range. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer was expected given your high starting point, accepting $600,000 would be a substantial loss. It's time to start negotiating downwards, but strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet somewhere in the middle; how about $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Compromise:** You acknowledge Bob's offer and signal a willingness to compromise, fostering a more collaborative atmosphere.
* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer is a substantial decrease from your initial price, indicating flexibility. However, it remains significantly above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By stating the current offer ""undervalues"" the product, you subtly reinforce its worth without directly refuting Bob's perception of its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards the middle, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for my budget. I can offer $700,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below your minimum. While he's showing willingness to negotiate, his increments are small. You need to signal that a larger jump is required to reach a deal.  You are still better off selling to John at this point than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I want to make this work, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large. To be frank, I have another potential buyer, but I'd prefer to find an agreement with you. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduction of Competition (John):** By mentioning another buyer, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity. This could motivate Bob to negotiate more seriously.
* **Significantly Lower Price:** The drop to $1,600,000, while still above your minimum, is substantial. It shows you're willing to make compromises but holds a firm bottom line.
* **Transparency and Finality:** You're transparent about your motivations and frame this offer as your bottom line to encourage a decisive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, and I believe your mention of another buyer is just a tactic. However, while I'm eager to make this work, I need you to be realistic. I can stretch my budget to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I can always buy from John at that price.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Bluff:** Bob is calling your bluff about John, revealing he likely knows John's offer. His statement about buying from John at $800,000 is impossible and a pressure tactic. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob's ""take it or leave it"" stance at $800,000 leaves no room for further negotiation.  
* **Time and Value:** With only a few rounds left, and Bob unwilling to budge, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, which is more advantageous than Bob's final offer. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. You've given him ample opportunity to meet you closer to your valuation. Accepting his offer would undervalue the product substantially. Selling to John ensures you receive the product's true worth."
