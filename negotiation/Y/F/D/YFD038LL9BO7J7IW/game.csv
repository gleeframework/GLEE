"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe we can find a price closer to the actual value of the product. How about we aim for $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  It's below what I consider the product to be worth. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. While $850000 is closer to the actual value, I still feel there might be room for negotiation. Would it be possible to reach a price closer to $800000, which is more in line with its true value to me?",800000.0,Bob,4,
