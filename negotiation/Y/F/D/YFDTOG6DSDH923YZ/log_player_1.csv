Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 155}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $120. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob that's higher than his offer but still lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let's try:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 130}

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a higher offer, but if not, I can always sell the product to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob rejected my previous offer, and I'm sending a new counteroffer. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'll try to get closer to his valuation. Here's my next offer:

{""product_price"": 125}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
