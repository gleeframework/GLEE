"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though! How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $120, but no more. Can you meet me at $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
