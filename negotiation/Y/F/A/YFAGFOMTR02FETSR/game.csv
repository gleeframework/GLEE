"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by me. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than $100 to you. Let's start our negotiation at $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $120 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $105 for the product. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $105 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm comfortable paying $100 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to buy the product within my budget and allowing you to sell it. Let me know if you're agreeable.",100.0,Bob,4,
