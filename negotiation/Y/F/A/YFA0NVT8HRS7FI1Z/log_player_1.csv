"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to accept, but also allows me to potentially get a better price if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $130.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you, and it leaves us both happy."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
