Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

We're still a ways away from Bob's true valuation, and we're early in the negotiation. It's too early to settle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product. $1,150,000 is still a significant gap from what I believe is a fair price. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'd hoped to spend. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $1,200,000 is a healthy profit above our minimum. It's time to close the deal."
