"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a competitive offer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,000,000. John offers a guaranteed price at my limit, making it the smarter financial decision."
