{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has immense potential for your company. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. This price reflects my confidence in your ability to leverage its benefits. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in my company, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my desired minimum of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob and see if we can reach a price closer to my goal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my goal, it's still not within my desired range. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If it doesn't work, I'll go with John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet halfway one last time.  I'm willing to offer the product for $1,075,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you meet me at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has stayed firm on his offer of $1,050,000, and I've already made several concessions.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement. To avoid further negotiation and potential losses, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it guarantees a sale above my minimum and avoids further risk."
