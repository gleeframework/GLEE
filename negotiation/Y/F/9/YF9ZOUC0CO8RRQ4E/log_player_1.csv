"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since Bob values the product at $800,000, there's room for negotiation. I'll see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always fall back on John's $800,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $850,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping Bob will see it that way and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I don't want to miss out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to offer $825,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll have to start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and I'm running out of time. I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiations with the potential for a lower price. 

Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a good profit, and I don't want to risk getting a worse offer from Bob in the next round."
