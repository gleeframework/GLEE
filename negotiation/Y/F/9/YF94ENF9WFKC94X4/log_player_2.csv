{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The offer is far too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting low to see if there's any room for negotiation.  $100 is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, as I have the option of buying from John for $120."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is closer to my max, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still below my maximum.  I'm hoping this shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $155 is tempting, I'm still within my budget and have rounds remaining. I'm going to try for one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay John's price, so I'm hoping Alice will accept to avoid losing the sale."

Alice is not willing to come down to my price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. I'm willing to pay his price to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product."
