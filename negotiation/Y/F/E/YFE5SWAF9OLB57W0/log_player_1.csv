Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's a strong opening offer that demonstrates the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my opening price, but still above my minimum acceptable value. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial assessment of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not where I want it to be. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a small step towards Bob's last offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on, while still getting a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable value, and I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher.  Since I can get a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, it's safer to cut my losses and sell to him."
