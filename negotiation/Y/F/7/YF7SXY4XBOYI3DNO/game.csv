"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $10,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I'm putting into negotiating. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $10,750. This price reflects the value of the product and provides a fair outcome for both of us. Let's close this deal,  I'm confident you won't regret it.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $10,500. I think this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",10500.0,Bob,6,
