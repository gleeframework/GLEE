$13,500 is way too much for Bob, and it makes more sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering John's offer."

While $11,250 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price."
