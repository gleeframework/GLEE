"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,000,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is your backup plan.**  You'll only go to John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target.**  $950,000 is still more than you'd like to pay, but it's within your budget and a decent improvement from her previous offer.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.** If you reject this offer, Alice might not budge further, and you could end up paying more or having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **The product is worth it.** Even at $950,000, you're still getting a good deal compared to buying from John, and the product's potential value to you makes it a worthwhile purchase."
