"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $80 would be a fair price given my budget constraints. Would it be possible for us to reach an agreement at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is clearly fixed on paying $80, which is our minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better outcome and risks losing the guaranteed sale to John."
