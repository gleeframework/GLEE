"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! It's a real game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is within his budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $107.50 is closer to his desired price, he can likely still negotiate a better deal.  He'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $106. If you're serious about making this deal, let's meet at that price. "", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $106. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $108 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm on her price:** Alice has already rejected two of Bob's counteroffers, showing she's willing to walk away.
* **Time is running out:**  This is Round 5, leaving only five rounds before Bob must buy from John.
* **A fair compromise:** While $108 is still more than Bob initially wanted, it's a reasonable compromise, especially considering he risks paying $120 to John. 

Bob is better off accepting the offer and securing the product for a price that's within his budget, avoiding the risk of a higher price from John."
