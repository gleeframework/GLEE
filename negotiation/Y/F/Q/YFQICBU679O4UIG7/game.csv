"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! It's a real game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $106. If you're serious about making this deal, let's meet at that price. ",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $106. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $108 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",108.0,Alice,5,
