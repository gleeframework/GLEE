"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially even more than $800000. I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects its worth, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I'm proposing a price of $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe it will be well worth your consideration. Please let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
