Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate, but it's also lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving some profit potential.  We'll see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of this negotiation.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $130?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $127.50. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $127.5. While I could potentially continue to negotiate and try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's likely that the negotiation will become more time-consuming and could even lead to a breakdown. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a profit, which is the most important thing at this point."
