"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is very interesting to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $850,000. Would that be feasible?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that.  $925,000 is tempting, but I need to stay closer to my budget.  Would you consider $875,000? I think that's a fair offer.",875000.0,Bob,6,
