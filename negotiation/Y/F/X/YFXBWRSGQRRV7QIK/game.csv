"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but it's a bit more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my maximum. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and my need to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can close this deal if we find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
