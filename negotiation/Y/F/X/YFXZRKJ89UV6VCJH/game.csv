"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I'm looking to pay closer to its intrinsic value.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, which would still be a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $850,000. Considering our conversation so far, I'd like to counteroffer $925,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product, while also acknowledging your willingness to pay a premium for it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product,  $925,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $887,500. This would still be a significant profit for you and a fair price for me.  Let's finalize this deal.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not ready to accept your offer of $887,500. Considering our previous conversations, I'd like to counteroffer $915,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're both willing to be flexible.  $915,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to go up a little more, but I need to stay under $900,000.  My final offer is $895,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it's time to close the deal.",895000.0,Bob,6,
