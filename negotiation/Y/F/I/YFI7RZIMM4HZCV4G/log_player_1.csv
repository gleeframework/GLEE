Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** My message clearly indicates that I'm open to discussion. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** Offering it to John for $100 is a safety net, but I want to see if I can get more from Bob. 

By starting high and showing willingness to negotiate, I hope to maximize my chances of getting a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  I believe there's room for a higher price. I can counteroffer and try to find a middle ground.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $100 provides a safety net, allowing me to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $110 to $95. 
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the ""fair price"" and the ""value of the product"" to make it sound like a good deal for him.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'm not losing money.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm still open to further discussion, but I'm getting closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. There's little room for negotiation at this point.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $100 ensures I get my minimum desired price. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially getting a lower price.

By selling to John, I'm securing a deal that meets my minimum requirements and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
