{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is attractive to Bob while still leaving room for potential counteroffers. It also includes a friendly message to establish a positive tone and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a fair price, I'm looking for a bit more. How about $12,500? This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  Could you do $11,750? That would make the deal work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While I would prefer a higher price, $11,750 is above my minimum threshold and a better deal than selling to John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
