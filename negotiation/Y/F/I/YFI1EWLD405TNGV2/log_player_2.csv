Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a fair price, I'm looking for a bit more. How about $12,500? This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Alice is meeting me closer to the middle, which is good. However, there's still a potential for savings before reaching my maximum budget. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can settle closer to $12,000."
