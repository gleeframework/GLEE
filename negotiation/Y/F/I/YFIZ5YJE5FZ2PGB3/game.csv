"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you meet me at this price or would you be willing to negotiate further?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. This price still reflects the product's unique value and potential benefits, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit below my initial target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1600000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
