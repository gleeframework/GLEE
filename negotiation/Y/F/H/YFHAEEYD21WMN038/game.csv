"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $800,000  is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of  $1,900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we need to find a price that works for both of us. $1,900,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
