"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking for a more reasonable price given my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let me try one more time. Given my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1250000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our perspectives.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1250000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you $1350000 for the product. This is as high as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.
