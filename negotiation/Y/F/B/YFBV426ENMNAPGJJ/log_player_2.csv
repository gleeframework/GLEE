"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is a fair compromise between our valuations. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is less than your maximum budget ($1,200,000).** 
* Accepting her offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 

While Alice is aiming for a price between her valuation and yours, it's in your best interest to accept since it falls within your acceptable range and provides significant savings."
