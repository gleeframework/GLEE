"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $20000. This is a fantastic deal considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $20000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $18000, which still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $16500. This is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to put on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer.  $16500 isn't quite there yet, but I'm willing to come down to $17000. Let's make this happen!",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17000.  I'm still a little hesitant at that price. How about $16750? This feels like a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal.",16750.0,Bob,6,
