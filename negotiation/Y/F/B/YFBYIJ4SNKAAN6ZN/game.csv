"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the best I can do.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $12,500. I can offer it to you for $12,750. This is the best I can do.",12750.0,Alice,7,
