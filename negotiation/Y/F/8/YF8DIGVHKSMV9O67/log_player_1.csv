Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and has a guaranteed sale at that price.  Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't just throw out a number; it emphasizes ""value"" and ""potential,"" framing the price as an investment rather than a cost.
* **Exclusivity:**  By positioning the offer as ""exclusive,"" Alice adds a subtle psychological element that could make Bob more eager to close the deal. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is key:**  This is just an opening offer.  Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and she'll need to decide how low she's willing to go.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** This aggressive strategy could backfire. If Bob is turned off by the high price, Alice risks losing him and having to settle for the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
