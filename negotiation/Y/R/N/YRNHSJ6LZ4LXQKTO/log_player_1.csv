Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit constrained by my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,150,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise.
