"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds immense value for you as well. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's start with $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit constrained by my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to at least cover my minimum value of $1,200,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  I think this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,150,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  However,  $1,150,000 still falls short of my minimum requirement.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's finalize this deal at my minimum price, and I'll ensure you receive a product that exceeds your expectations. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
