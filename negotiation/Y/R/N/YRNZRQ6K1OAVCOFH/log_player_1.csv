Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High but Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for him to find it appealing compared to your alternative buyer. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you add a subtle pressure tactic without being overly aggressive."
