,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is still a good price considering the value the product holds, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great price for you, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your perspective, $875,000 is still significantly below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $925,000, but this is my final offer. It's a fair compromise, considering the value this product offers you. I'm confident you won't find a better deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $912,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and represents a solid deal for both of us. Let's close this deal now.",912500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $912,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away from this deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'm going to make a firm offer of $880,000, and I expect you to consider it seriously. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",880000.0,Bob,8,
