"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's significantly lower than your estimated value, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

You can likely get a better deal from Alice. It's worth rejecting her offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a significant discount from your estimated value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.
