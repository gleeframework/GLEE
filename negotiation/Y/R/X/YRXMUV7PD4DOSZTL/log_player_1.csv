"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer of $15,000. This is based on the fact that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer downwards in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's too early to sell to John, as I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $12,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate. I hope this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm dropping my offer to $10,500.  This is my final compromise before considering selling to John. I'm hopeful Bob will accept this price, as it's still significantly higher than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob.  His offers are still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  To ensure I don't lose out completely, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
