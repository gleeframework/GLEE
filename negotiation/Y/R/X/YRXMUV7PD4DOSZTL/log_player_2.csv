You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is way above your budget. It's best to reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower price, aiming to get a good deal.  I'm offering $6,000, which is about 40% lower than Alice's initial offer. This will hopefully kickstart the negotiation and encourage Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $7,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, but I'm still not willing to pay her initial asking price. Hopefully, this will encourage her to come down closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high. I'll reject and try to get a lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice my absolute maximum price, $8,000.  This is what I would pay John, and it's within my budget. If Alice rejects, I can always go with John. This should either convince Alice to accept or at least lead to a final offer from her that's close to my budget."
