Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $1,500,000 (the minimum you'll accept)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **John's Value:** $1,500,000 (your guaranteed fallback)

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price, you have leverage.  You should aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but low enough that he's tempted to accept.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its exclusive nature and the value it offers, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It emphasizes the product's exclusivity and value, framing it as desirable.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is strategically placed:
    * It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate if needed.
    * It's significantly lower than John's offer, making it appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one offer strategy. You could start higher and be willing to negotiate down, especially if you want to gauge Bob's interest level."
