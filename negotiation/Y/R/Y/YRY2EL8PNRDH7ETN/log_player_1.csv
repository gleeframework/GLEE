{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is strategically positioned:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but it gives him room to negotiate. 
* **Lower than my minimum:** It's below my minimum of $15,000, but gives me some leeway to potentially negotiate higher.
* **Encourages negotiation:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to respond, opening up the possibility of a counter-offer.

This strategy balances the goal of earning as much money as possible with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. It leaves space for negotiation, which could lead to a higher price, while also keeping the potential sale to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value and my initial offer. I'm not ready to accept such a low price. There's still a chance to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  Selling to John is still an option, but I'll try one more round of negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer - if you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, it's getting close to my lower limit and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
