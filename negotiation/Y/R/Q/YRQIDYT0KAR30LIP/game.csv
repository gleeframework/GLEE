,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from that number. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
