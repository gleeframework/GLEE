"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm looking for something closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $8500 for the product. This allows us to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value you've set. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my desired price point.  While I would like to get closer to $9,000, it's getting late in the negotiations and accepting this offer secures a sale that is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000."
