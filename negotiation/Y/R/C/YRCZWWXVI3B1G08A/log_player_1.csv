Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your company. My asking price is $1,750,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's discuss further and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've set the price at $1,750,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value while opening the door for discussion. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum of $1,500,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can counteroffer.  If negotiations fail, I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, or if the negotiation stalls, I can always sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to accept.  Considering the product's potential and our previous discussions, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both sides."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $1,250,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but significantly closer to my minimum and hopefully more appealing.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product and the need for a price that's fair for both parties. I've also highlighted the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still being above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects again, I can further lower my price in the next round or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,100,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price, hoping to find a compromise.
* **Sell to John:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring a favorable outcome for myself."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm unwilling to sell the product for such a low price, as it wouldn't be a financially beneficial deal for me. 

At this point, further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring that I achieve my desired financial goal."
