Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to accept.  Considering the product's potential and our previous discussions, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both sides.
