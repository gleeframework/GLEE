Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significant, and $850,000 is considerably below its worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
