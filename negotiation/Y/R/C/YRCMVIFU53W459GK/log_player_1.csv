Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significant, and $850,000 is considerably below its worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. If you're not willing to accept this, I may have to consider other options.

Bob is holding firm at a price far below the product's value to me. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Selling to John ensures I receive the full value I place on the product."
