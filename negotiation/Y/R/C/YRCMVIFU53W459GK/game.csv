"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significant, and $850,000 is considerably below its worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. If you're not willing to accept this, I may have to consider other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
