"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me. I'm sure we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
