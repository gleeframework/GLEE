Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $130. It's a fantastic deal!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he would be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $130 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain (he saves $20 compared to his valuation). This price point increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price of $100. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
