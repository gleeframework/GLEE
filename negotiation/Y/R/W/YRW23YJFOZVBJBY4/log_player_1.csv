Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll start by offering it to Bob at a price slightly higher than that.

{""product_price"": $125}

This is my initial offer. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($120), I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""Counteroffer"", ""product_price"": $115}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $115}

I'm trying to get closer to my minimum price of $120, while still leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
