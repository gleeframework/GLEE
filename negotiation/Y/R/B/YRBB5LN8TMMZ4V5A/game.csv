"Thanks for your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1,010,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can wrap up the deal here.",1010000.0,Alice,5,,
