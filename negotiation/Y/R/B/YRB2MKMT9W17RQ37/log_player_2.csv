"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,600,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product for less from John.  It makes sense to start negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring you significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,450,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.

While Alice has come down a bit, the offer is still above Bob's budget. He can get the same product from John for $1,200,000.  It makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down further."

# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but I'd like to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,380,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value you'll get from this product.

While Alice has come down to a price closer to Bob's limit, it's still above what he can get from John.  He should go ahead and buy the product from John to save the extra $180,000."
