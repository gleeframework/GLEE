"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $12,500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations! I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we aim for $13,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but still a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation. While I agree the product is valuable, my budget is fairly firm.  I could potentially stretch to $11,500, but that's absolutely my limit.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but  $13,500 is still  too far from what I'm willing to pay.  I'd be willing to bump my offer to $11,750, but that's the absolute highest I can go.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see we're really close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $12,750, which is just $250 above your last offer. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if this works for you.",12750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I can do $12,000, but that's absolutely it.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with a different seller.",12000.0,Bob,10,
