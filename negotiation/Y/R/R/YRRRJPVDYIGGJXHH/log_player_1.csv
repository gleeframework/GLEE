Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price for a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob gets for the price, making it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate by asking for Bob's thoughts.
* **Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay a price higher than his perceived value, which means there's a chance to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, but I want to try to maximize my profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Moderate Compromise:** I'm not drastically dropping my price, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down to $1,050,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and framing my counteroffer as a ""great deal"" for him.
* **Encouraging Compromise:**  I'm using language like ""find a compromise"" to encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,025,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:**  We've been negotiating for a few rounds now, and further negotiation might not get me a significantly better price.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially losing John as a buyer if the negotiation drags on too long. 
* **Secure Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good profit without risking further negotiation."
