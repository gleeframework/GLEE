"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However,  $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I could consider a price of $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a fair price. I'd like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market conditions and the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
