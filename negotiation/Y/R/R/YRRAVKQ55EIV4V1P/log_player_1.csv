{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring you still get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer allows you to potentially secure a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
