"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your target of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still within your budget and is a good compromise. It's only $75,000 more than your initial target of $1,000,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a much lower price."
