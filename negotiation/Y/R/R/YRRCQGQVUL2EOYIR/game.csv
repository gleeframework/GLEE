"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I am willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it shows you understand the value of this product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a successful agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
