"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price above what the product is worth to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping he sees the potential for a good return on investment.
* **Openness:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in negotiation.

**Important Note:** I'm aware that this price is higher than what I need to sell to John.  However, I'm aiming to maximize my profits and see if I can get closer to my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is a good deal for him, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.  
* **Avoiding Immediate Sell:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a secure option, but I'm not willing to give up on potentially getting a higher price from Bob just yet.  

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit from the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that is above my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm highlighting the potential for profit for Bob, hoping to appeal to his business sense and make him see the value in a higher price.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive and encouraging language to keep the negotiation amicable and open to a compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'm cautiously optimistic that Bob will see the value in this counteroffer. I'm willing to continue negotiating if necessary, but I'm aiming to secure a deal close to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** The negotiation is progressing, and there's still a chance to get a price closer to my target.
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, but I'm confident that I can secure a higher price with Bob if I continue to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to secure a deal that benefits both of us.  I will likely aim for a price between $950,000 and $1,000,000 to find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product to you for $975,000. This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $975,000, I'm finding a middle ground between Bob's offer of $950,000 and my previous offer of $1,050,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price would allow both of us to walk away happy, making the offer more appealing to Bob from a business perspective.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to maintain a good relationship and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

I believe that this counteroffer is a strong one. It's a fair compromise that might be attractive to Bob, especially considering his previous statements about wanting to find a way to make the deal work. I'm hoping to close the deal in this round, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. If this doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and I need to ensure I secure a price that meets my needs. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially considering Bob's statement that he's willing to consider other options if we don't come to an agreement. 

**Next Steps:** I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly higher than $925,000. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a win-win situation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our mutual interest in closing this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm still holding out for a price above my minimum desired $1,000,000, but I'm being realistic about the situation and acknowledging Bob's financial limitations.
* **Compromise and Finality:** I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer of $975,000 and his offer of $925,000. This suggests a willingness to compromise and could be perceived as my final offer.
* **Positive and Urgent Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the mutual interest in closing the deal, creating a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive to Bob, especially since I've shown a willingness to compromise. If he rejects it, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $1,000,000.  However, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price if possible."
