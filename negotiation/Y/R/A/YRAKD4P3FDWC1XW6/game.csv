"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to start with an offer of $20,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm happy to consider it if we can work towards a more reasonable price. How about $12,000? It's a good starting point for us to explore a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value to me is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $17,000? This is as low as I can go for now.",17000.0,Alice,5,
