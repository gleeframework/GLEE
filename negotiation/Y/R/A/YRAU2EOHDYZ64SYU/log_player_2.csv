"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget of $8000, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This is my best and final offer for now. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. There's room to negotiate further, and he should try to get closer to $8,000 before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit above my target, though.  How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I have to be honest with you, I'm not willing to go below $12000. I've already mentioned this to you, and I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant drop from her previous offer, it's still above his budget and higher than John's price. There are still rounds left, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but that's the lowest price I can offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'd rather not waste any more time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. 

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  With only a few rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will come down further, and John's offer is the best option to stay within his budget and avoid further negotiation."
