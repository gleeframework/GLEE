"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget of $8000, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This is my best and final offer for now. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit above my target, though.  How about $9000?  I think that's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to get a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I have to be honest with you, I'm not willing to go below $12000. I've already mentioned this to you, and I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11500. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but that's the lowest price I can offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'd rather not waste any more time.",11000.0,Alice,7,
