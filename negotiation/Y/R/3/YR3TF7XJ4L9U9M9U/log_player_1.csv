Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products. Can you meet me at this price?

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,450,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I think I can go a bit lower than that. How about we try $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price range significantly lower than our target. While his offer is tempting, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Holding firm now might push him closer to our desired price point in the next rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to ensure you see the full potential this product offers. However, I need to be upfront â€“ my price floor is $1,400,000. This reflects its true worth, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment in the long run."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By Round 7, it's time to signal our firmness on the price. We're holding at $1,400,000 while reiterating the product's value proposition. This conveys seriousness while still leaving room for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price floor, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1,400,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think $1,350,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has inched upward and is getting closer to our floor price.  With only a few rounds left, and his indication that this is his ""absolute maximum,"" the risk of him walking away outweighs the potential reward of pushing for a slightly higher price. Accepting at $1,350,000 secures a substantial profit."
