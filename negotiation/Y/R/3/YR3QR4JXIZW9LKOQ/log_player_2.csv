Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly holding firm around the $825,000 mark.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting this offer saves me $175,000 compared to John's price, which is a significant savings."
