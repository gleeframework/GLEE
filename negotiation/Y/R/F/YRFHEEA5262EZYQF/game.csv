"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you the product for $1050000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $975000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $975000 is still a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1050000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on that, so I'll meet you at $1025000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
