"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $900,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can make a strong offer.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is worth a lot to me, but I'm looking to spend around $750,000. Would you be open to considering that?  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. Let's try $850,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer $800,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
