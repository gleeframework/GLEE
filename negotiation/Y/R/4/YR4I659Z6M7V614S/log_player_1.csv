Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its potential value to me. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to get closer to our desired outcome. I'm confident this price is reasonable given the product's potential and our shared goal of reaching an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to go above his perceived value of $800,000.  While he's showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in smaller increments.  At this point, it's more profitable to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
