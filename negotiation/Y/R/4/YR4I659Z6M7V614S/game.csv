"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its potential value to me. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 undervalues the inherent worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This adjusted price takes into account its unique value proposition while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably offer.  Let's compromise at $950,000. This represents a significant step towards your desired price while staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find middle ground.  Let's aim for a final agreement - I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects its true value while acknowledging your strong interest.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm eager to reach a deal, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's aim for $900,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to get closer to our desired outcome. I'm confident this price is reasonable given the product's potential and our shared goal of reaching an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
