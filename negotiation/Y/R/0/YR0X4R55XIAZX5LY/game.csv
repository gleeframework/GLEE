"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800, which is closer to the product's value to me. Can you meet me in the middle?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,150? It's closer to your price and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,900, which is a bit closer to the product's value to me. Can you meet me at this price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
