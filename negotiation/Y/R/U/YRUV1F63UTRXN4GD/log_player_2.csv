# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, but there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
