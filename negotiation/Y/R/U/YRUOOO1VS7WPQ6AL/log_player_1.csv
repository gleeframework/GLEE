Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is closer to my desired value, while still being appealing to Bob because it's significantly lower than his perceived value. This sets the stage for a potential negotiation that could benefit both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,125,000? This would allow me to move forward with the sale and still provide you with a great value."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counter.  I'm getting closer to my limit. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,087,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,087,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price and much better than selling to John.  Accepting this offer will ensure I make a decent profit and avoid further negotiation."
