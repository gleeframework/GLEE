"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the very first round. We want to see if there's any room for negotiation and potentially get a better price. We have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to explore options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that you are serious about negotiating and are willing to pay a lower price.  It's a substantial enough reduction to potentially spark a negotiation but not so low that Alice is likely to immediately reject it. We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but it's still too high. We have time and want to try to get the price down further.  We'll continue negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that we're serious about negotiating and willing to meet her halfway. However, it's still significantly lower than her offer, leaving room for further negotiation. This approach aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach an agreement in the following rounds."
