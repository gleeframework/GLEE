Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true value.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's guaranteed price creates an incentive for Bob.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Even though John guarantees $12,000, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable. Waiting for John could have unseen delays or complications.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is firm, the wording leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to counter-offer. It doesn't completely shut down the negotiation."
