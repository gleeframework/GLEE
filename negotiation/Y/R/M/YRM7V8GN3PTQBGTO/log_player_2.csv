{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's likely she's willing to come down further. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A price of $550,000 represents a substantial discount from her initial offer and gives her room to come up without feeling overly pressured. This counteroffer also reflects my maximum budget while leaving room for potential concessions."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 575000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This price is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's closer to her original price point, suggesting I'm serious about reaching a deal. The goal is to find a middle ground and hopefully secure a deal before I run out of rounds."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 590000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to increase my counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. This price is closer to Alice's last offer, but still within my budget, and leaves room for further negotiation. With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to find a middle ground while maximizing my savings."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $630,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $630,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting close to my desired price, and we're running out of time. Accepting this offer will save me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. While I'd prefer to get the price lower, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and having to buy from John for a higher price is too great at this point."
