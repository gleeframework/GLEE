This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's a good compromise between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $9500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  If he refuses, I'm ready to sell to John for $10,000."

Bob's offer of $8,700 is still too low for me.  I've already made several concessions and it seems like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll take John's offer of $10,000 and avoid further negotiations."
