Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $80 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay $80, so $100 is a good starting point to negotiate from.
* **Below your minimum:** You're not selling it for less than $120, so you have room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Reasonable:** It's a fair offer that could lead to a quick agreement. 

Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $90 for it. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I ideally want to get.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $95.  Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. However, I still feel that $95 is a bit high for me. I would like to propose $90 as a fair price for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is persistent on $90, which is still below my minimum. While I could continue to counter-offer, I'm concerned that this negotiation is becoming protracted and I'm not confident I'll get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to sell to John for $120 to ensure I get my minimum."
