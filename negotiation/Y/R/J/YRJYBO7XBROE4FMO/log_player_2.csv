"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This offers you a significant saving compared to its worth and ensures a fair transaction for both parties. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, accepting her offer of $12,000 is the best course of action for a few reasons:

* **Significant Savings:** You save $3,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Below Your Limit:** The price is well within your $15,000 budget.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting her offer in hopes of a lower price might backfire. She could refuse to negotiate, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price. 

Accepting the $12,000 offer secures the product at a good price and eliminates the risk of paying more."
