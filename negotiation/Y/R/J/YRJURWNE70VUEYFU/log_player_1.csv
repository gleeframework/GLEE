{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can adjust the price in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if there's any wiggle room for a higher price. There's a possibility that Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he's truly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,500? That would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget at $12500. Would you be willing to consider $11000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
