"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. Alice is likely willing to negotiate lower since the product is only worth $80 to her.  You can always buy from John for $150 if needed."
