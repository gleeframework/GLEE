"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is at least $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle, but I think this price is more reasonable considering the product's worth to you is at least $1500000. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $975000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think this price is more reasonable considering the product's worth to you is at least $1500000. I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
