"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm not willing to sell for $15,000 yet, as it's below my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but I need to recoup more of my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 18000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  $16,000 is tempting, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $17,000?  I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach my target.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to reach your target, Alice, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're very close to my minimum price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. $16,500 is a good price, and I'm happy with the outcome."
