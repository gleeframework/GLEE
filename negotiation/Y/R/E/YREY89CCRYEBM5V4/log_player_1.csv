Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting at my desired price point, knowing it's more than the product is worth to him. This is a strategy to see if he's willing to pay more than his perceived value, and potentially negotiate upwards.  If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $150. I'm willing to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that is significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $135 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
 
I'm offering Bob a price of $135, which is a compromise between my minimum desired price and his offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also keeps the price above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a reasonable price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his latest offer of $125 is still below my minimum threshold of $150.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
