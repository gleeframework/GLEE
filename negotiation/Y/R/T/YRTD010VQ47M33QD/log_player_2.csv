Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $12,000.  He's been negotiating with Alice for a while and it's clear she's unwilling to go lower than $13,250, which is still above his budget.  It's time to cut his losses and move on to a seller who can meet his price."
