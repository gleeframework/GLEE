{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $80. 
* It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. 
* This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* It leaves room for compromise and potential agreement without immediately resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my target price of $80. 
* I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better deal. 
* There are still rounds left, and I might be able to reach a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This is my final offer, as it matches my maximum budget and John's price. 
* I'm hoping Alice will recognize the value of a quick sale and accept. 
* If she doesn't, I'll be happy to switch to John and get the product at my target price."
