"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've been working on for a long time, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me, but I'm confident that you'll see the potential in this opportunity. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
