{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her product valuation, it's still higher than my maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting and providing a counteroffer, I can try to get closer to my desired price range."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the unique value proposition of our product and your assessment, I am prepared to consider a more flexible approach. For you, I propose a price of $10,500. This is a significant discount from the original price, while still allowing us to maintain a reasonable margin. I believe this offer strikes a good balance between our interests.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to my acceptable price range, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to negotiate a little further, as there's a small margin between her offer and John's price. I'll try one more counteroffer before resorting to John's fixed price."
