"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $11,500, which is still above your desired price point.
* **Strategy:**  Reject the offer and counteroffer to see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Minimize cost while still securing the product.
* **Counteroffer:**  $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, representing a significant discount from Alice's offer while still being above her minimum price.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating a strong preference for a lower price.  It opens the door for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can come down to $11,000, which still gives you a good deal. Let's meet halfway on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000 is still higher than your desired price point.
* **Strategy:**  Reject the offer and continue to negotiate.  You have 7 rounds remaining and can still potentially reach a lower price.  Alice is demonstrating flexibility, so there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $10,750. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to where we both want to be."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Get the best possible price while keeping negotiations open.
* **Counteroffer:** $10,750 is a compromise that's closer to Alice's last offer ($11,000) but still well below her initial price. It shows a willingness to meet halfway while also pushing for a lower price.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer continues to demonstrate a strong preference for a lower price while showing that you're willing to negotiate. It keeps the pressure on Alice to make a concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $10,875.  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still securing the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,875 is very close to your target price of $10,500.
* **Strategy:**  Accepting the offer is a good compromise. You've successfully negotiated a significant discount from the initial price, and while you could potentially push for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential savings.  You have a limited number of rounds left, and  it's unlikely that Alice will go much lower."
