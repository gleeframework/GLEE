Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,000,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate while still being within a range Bob might consider.
* **Value-Focused Message:** Emphasize the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the price and shift Bob's focus from the raw numbers.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA to allow room for counter-offers.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might be more flexible on price.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy ready."
