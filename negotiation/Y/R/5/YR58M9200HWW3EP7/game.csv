"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $11,000?  That would be a great price for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
