Alice's offer:

Alice is trying to inch the price up after a rejection. It's time to stand firm or consider John's offer as we progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but my budget is firm at $76. If you're unable to meet that, I might have to explore other options."",
 ""product_price"": 76
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stand Firm:** Alice tried to increase the price. We need to reiterate our position and hold firm at $76.
* **Introduce Scarcity:** By mentioning ""other options,"" we subtly signal that we might go with John's offer if Alice doesn't budge. This might push her to accept. 
* **Polite but Firm:** Maintaining a polite tone is important to avoid offending Alice and derailing the negotiation."
