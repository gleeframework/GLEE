"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $850000 to me. Would you be willing to consider $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and rarity. I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
