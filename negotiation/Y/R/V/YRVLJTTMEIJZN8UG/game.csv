"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is significantly below the value I'm confident this product will bring to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to demonstrate my commitment to a successful negotiation. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
