"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and it's a significant saving compared to buying from John. There's no reason to reject this offer."
