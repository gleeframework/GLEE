"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000.  It's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm interested in the product and believe it has value, but I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is a little too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This reflects the significant value this product holds.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly your maximum budget. You could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer again and you'd be forced to buy from John for the same price. It's safer to accept Alice's offer and secure the product within your budget."
