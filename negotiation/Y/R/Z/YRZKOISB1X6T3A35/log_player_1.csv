Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100, I'm offering the product to Bob at the lowest possible price to maximize my chances of selling it to him. This way, I still get my desired value for the product and have the possibility of selling it for a higher price."
