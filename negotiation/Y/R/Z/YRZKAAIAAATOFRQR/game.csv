"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $150. Could we possibly negotiate towards that amount?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go down to $200. Would you be willing to consider that?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $200 is still a bit out of my range, I would like to propose $160 as a potential compromise.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount to $220, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a good deal, and I think you'll really like the product",220.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway again. I would like to propose $190 as a fair compromise.",190.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $210 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",210.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $220, Bob. I've already made some significant concessions. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. If you meet me at $220, I'll include a free accessory that's worth $50. Would you be interested in that?",220.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the additional accessory is tempting, I believe we've reached the limit of what I'm comfortable paying. I would like to stick to $200 for the product.",200.0,Bob,10,
