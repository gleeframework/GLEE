"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value you've placed on this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident that this is a deal we can both be happy with. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident that we can finalize the deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the value we've both established for this product, I'm willing to go down to $10,000 one last time.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
