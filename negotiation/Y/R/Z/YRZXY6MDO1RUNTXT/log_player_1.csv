"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, making the offer seem more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in a conversation. 

I'm aiming to get a good price while also keeping the negotiation open for the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob, especially since I have 8 rounds left.

I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value you've placed on this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still staying above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm bottom line.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value he places on the product, hoping to persuade him to meet me halfway.
* **Open Ended:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by asking for Bob's opinion. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining my goal of getting a higher price than Bob's initial offer."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome.  I have 6 rounds left and believe I can continue to push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."

```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to secure a price that's closer to my target while still leaving room for potential compromise in the remaining rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident that we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
