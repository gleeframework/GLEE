Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement for this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for its value.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,100,000?  This would still be a significant saving for you compared to the product's full potential value, and it allows me to secure a decent return. What do you say?
