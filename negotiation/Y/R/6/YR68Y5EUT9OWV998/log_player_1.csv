Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $80. I'm not going to rush into a deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $75 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 82.50}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get close to your asking price, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we compromise at $78? I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial offer, but I can't go much further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, this is a good compromise and I'd rather not risk losing the deal entirely."
