"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'll offer you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can you consider a price of $1000000? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $1025000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1000000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $990000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",990000.0,Bob,6,
