Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price:** This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer:** If he's genuinely interested, this might make him think the product is worth more than he initially thought.

This strategy is designed to maximize my potential earnings, but I'm also prepared to potentially accept a lower offer or even sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a drastic loss. 

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. I hope this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still too low for me. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not confident I can get him to go higher. It's becoming clear that Bob might not be willing to pay what the product is worth to me.  I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially end up with a lower price.  

Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. It's a safer and more certain option than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
