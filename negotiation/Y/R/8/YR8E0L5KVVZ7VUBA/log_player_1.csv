Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be compensated for the true value of this product.  How about $1,175,000? I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,100,000 again, but I'll throw in some additional perks, such as a 5-year warranty and priority customer support. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and the added perks sweeten the deal. Accepting $1,100,000 at this point ensures I make a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer completely."
