Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is too low, and I think I can get more if I push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $9,000. How about $8,800?  It's a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 8800}
