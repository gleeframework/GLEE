"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely do better. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's flexibility.  He's aiming for a price that's still within his budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This move shows Bob is serious about the deal but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $9,000. How about $8,800?  It's a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $8,800 is a good compromise.  It's still within Bob's budget and is a good saving compared to John's price of $10,000.  There's no guarantee that Bob will get a better offer in the next rounds, so it's a good time to close the deal."
