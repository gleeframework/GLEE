"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $9,500. I think it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point of $8,000 (Alice's value for the product). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing willingness to compromise while still leaving room for potential further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and ending up buying from John for $10,000 outweighs the potential benefit of trying to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more. Accepting the offer at $9,000 is the most pragmatic choice, securing the product at a reasonable price."
