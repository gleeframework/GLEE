"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,600,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to adjust the price.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to see this product in your hands, $1,600,000 isn't quite enough to cover the value I see in it. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop the price to $1,650,000.  What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I'm still committed to staying within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,625,000 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise considering its value. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our ongoing discussions and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,625,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,637,500? It's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1637500.0,Alice,5,
