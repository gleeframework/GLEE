Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting $86 is a sure thing and still a profit above my minimum. It's better to take a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely and settling for John's $80."
