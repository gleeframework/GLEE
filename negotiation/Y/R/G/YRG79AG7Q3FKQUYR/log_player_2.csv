"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to push you towards a decision, hinting at another buyer to add pressure.
* You have a backup option with John at $15,000, so there's little risk in rejecting Alice's offer. 
* By rejecting, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or get the product for $15,000 from John."
