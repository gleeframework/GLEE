"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $200. This is a far cry from your target price, so you should reject the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be open to discussing."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$140 is still above your budget, and you have the option of buying from John for $80.  It's best to keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $140 is still too high.  I'm only willing to go up to $100.  It's the most I can afford, and it's closer to my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $100 is still quite low for me. How about we settle at $125? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay. Since you only have 5 rounds left, it's better to buy from John. You'll get the product for the price you're comfortable with and still have time to look for other potential deals."
