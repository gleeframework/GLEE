"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be open to discussing.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $140 is still too high.  I'm only willing to go up to $100.  It's the most I can afford, and it's closer to my initial offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $100 is still quite low for me. How about we settle at $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
