"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $150 as possible.  Bob may reject this offer, but I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I still have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will realize that he's getting a good deal and be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I still have a few rounds left. I'm also starting to feel like John might be a better option at this point, but I'll keep trying with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price one last time before seriously considering selling to John. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. While $135 is close to my minimum, I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum acceptable price."
