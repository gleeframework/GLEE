""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Deal:**  While a higher price is ideal, it's crucial to avoid being overly greedy. A price of $14,000 leaves a good profit margin while increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. It avoids the risk of losing him to John's guaranteed $12,000 offer."
