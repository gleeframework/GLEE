{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we have a strong starting point. Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** While a direct justification isn't strictly necessary,  hinting at the product's ""value and potential"" might make Bob more amenable to a higher price. 
* **Gauge interest:** This offer is primarily about gauging Bob's interest and seeing how high he might be willing to go. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If we had information about Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), we could tailor our approach. 
* **Time sensitivity:** If there's a time crunch to sell, we might be more aggressive with our pricing. 

This initial offer allows us to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while still keeping the option of a guaranteed sale to John."
