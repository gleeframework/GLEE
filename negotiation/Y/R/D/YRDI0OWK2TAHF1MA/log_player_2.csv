"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm aiming to sell it for $14,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows he's serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for further bargaining. By offering $12,000, Bob is still leaving some room for compromise while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's target price, he's still willing to push for a better deal.  He can likely negotiate a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to be strategic. He's showing Alice that he's serious about getting a deal while also demonstrating flexibility.  He's moved closer to Alice's offer, but still keeping some room for further negotiation. This approach maintains a positive tone while keeping the pressure on Alice."
