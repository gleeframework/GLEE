Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** The price is still significantly less than the product's worth to Bob, so it's a fair offer, giving him a good potential deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a significant profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* I'll keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly motivated to buy, and I can likely get closer to my desired price.
* **Room for compromise:**  My initial offer was significantly higher, suggesting I'm willing to compromise. However, rejecting his counteroffer shows I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control in the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer closer to my initial price of $950,000, but acknowledge Bob's willingness to meet halfway.  This shows I'm flexible but still value the product highly.
* I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this product. How about we settle on $900,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (sort of):** My counteroffer of $900,000 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm not accepting Bob's $850,000 offer because it's too low for me.  This demonstrates that I still value the product highly.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  My message emphasizes that this price is still a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to accept.  It also leaves room for further discussion and negotiation if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next offer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John.
* I'll continue to keep John's $800,000 offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $875,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This means I'm close to securing a profitable deal.
* **Limited Upside:**  There's not much room for further negotiation. Bob is showing a clear limit, and pushing too hard might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee I'll get a significantly higher price.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale. 
* I'll consider this experience for future negotiations and try to understand Bob's negotiation style better."
