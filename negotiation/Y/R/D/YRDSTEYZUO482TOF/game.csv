"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $12000 to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to pay $9500, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to pay $9500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to go up to $9800, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to sell at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to go up to $9800, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to hold out for a better offer. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me at $12000. If you're not willing to pay that, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $15000.",12000.0,Alice,7,
