Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Justification:**  The message doesn't just throw out a number, it hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it doesn't completely price Bob out. It leaves space for him to counter-offer if he's interested. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could choose to offer a price closer to $1,500,000 to ensure a quicker sale, or even go higher than $1,900,000. The best approach depends on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a deal with Bob."
