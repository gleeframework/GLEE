I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed sale price of $1,200,000 with John. 

This strategy is based on a few assumptions:

* **Bob's potential value:**  I'm hoping the product is worth more to Bob than $1,200,000, which is why I'm starting high. 
* **Negotiation room:** A higher initial offer gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob pushes back. 
* **Risk tolerance:** I'm willing to risk losing the sale to John if Bob doesn't accept, as I'm still guaranteed a decent profit.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with minimizing risk."
