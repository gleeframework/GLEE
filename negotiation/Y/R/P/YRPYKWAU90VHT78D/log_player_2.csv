{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting allows me to explore negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. It's likely she'll reject this, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get even closer to my target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still holding firm on getting a good deal.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while also keeping the pressure on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is closer to my target.  I'm getting a decent discount compared to John's price, and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice might not budge further, or I might run out of rounds and have to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good deal, so I'm accepting it."
