"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and how many rounds are left.  However, I'm always aware of John's offer of $15,000, so I won't go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still above John's offer.  I have 8 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $18,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price,  we're now at round 4, and I need to be realistic.  $16,000 is a good profit, and there's a risk of losing even that if I continue to negotiate.  This is a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal."
