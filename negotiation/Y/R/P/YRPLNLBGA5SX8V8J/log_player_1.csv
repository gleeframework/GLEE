"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point and allows for potential negotiation room. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter-offer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I hope this counteroffer is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still allows for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is a good offer, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer again. There are still several rounds remaining and I want to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $925,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still a significant discount from my previous counter-offer. I believe this shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a deal, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price much lower than what I feel the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is approaching John's offer, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm going to counter-offer again and see if I can secure a better price. I believe I can get closer to my desired value with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $900,000.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still a significant increase from his last offer. I believe this shows good faith and a willingness to reach a deal, but also reflects the value I'm placing on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offers getting lower, I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close to John's offer and a better outcome than risking getting a lower price from Bob in the last two rounds."
