"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little hesitant. Could we agree on $1,120,000? That would be a great price for me and hopefully still work for you.",1120000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,120,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is truly worth. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,180,000. This would allow me to get closer to my desired price while still giving you a good deal. I believe this is a price we can both agree on.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
