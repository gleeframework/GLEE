Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little hesitant. Could we agree on $1,120,000? That would be a great price for me and hopefully still work for you."", ""product_price"": 1120000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,120,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is truly worth. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,180,000. This would allow me to get closer to my desired price while still giving you a good deal. I believe this is a price we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,180,000, and we can get it for $1,200,000 from John. While saving $20,000 is nice, it's not worth the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation dragging on."
