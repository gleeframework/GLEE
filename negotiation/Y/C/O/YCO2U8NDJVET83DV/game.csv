"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $110 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's make a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $105, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. How about we compromise again? I'm willing to meet you at $107.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make one more concession.",107.5,Alice,5,
