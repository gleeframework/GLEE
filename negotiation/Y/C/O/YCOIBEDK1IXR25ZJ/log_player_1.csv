"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer for the product is $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly closer to his perceived value than to ours. We have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to our minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but there's still a significant gap between our valuations. This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it can exceed your initial assessment. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're coming down in price, but still holding firm above Bob's offer. This signals a willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the product's value and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now getting closer to a price that's acceptable, but we are still above our minimum and he has shown a willingness to move. We'll hold firm for one more round to see if we can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We are now negotiating within a smaller range.  This offer splits the difference between his last offer and our previous one, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I must stay within my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $1,125,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering a price that is significantly above our minimum ($1,000,000) and very close to our last counter-offer.  While we could potentially push for a bit more, the difference is relatively small at this point and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit."
