"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's start with a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm excited about the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe the value it offers you justifies this price.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $812,500? This price reflects the value of the product and also allows you to stay within your budget. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $795,000, which is a compromise between our last offers. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",795000.0,Bob,6,
