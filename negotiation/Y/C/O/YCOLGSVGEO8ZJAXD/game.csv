"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Can you meet me at $9,800? That would be a great compromise for me.",9800.0,Bob,4,
