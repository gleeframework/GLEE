"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $140, which is still more than you're willing to pay. You can get the product from John for $150, which is your maximum price. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
