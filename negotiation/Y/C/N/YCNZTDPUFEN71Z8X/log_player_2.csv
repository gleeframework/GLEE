"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. Given its high value and your interest, I believe this price strikes a fair balance between the product's worth and your valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still more than you'd ideally like to pay. You have room to negotiate, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to offer the product to you for $13,500. This price reflects a compromise that I hope will be acceptable to you while also ensuring a reasonable return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to your ideal price, you can still potentially get a better deal. You know Alice is motivated to sell (since she values the product at $12,000), so there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer gives you a chance to try and push for a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Based on our previous discussions, I am pleased to offer the product to you for $13,250. This price allows for a fair exchange while reflecting the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,250, which is very close to your last counteroffer of $13,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks a deadlock or Alice backing out entirely.  Accepting the offer is the best move, as it secures the product at a price that's within your budget and saves you from paying the full $15,000 to John."
