"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $750000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. This price still leaves room for a profit for both of us, considering the product's true value to me is $800000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this offer is a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
