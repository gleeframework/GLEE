{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  The negotiation with Bob has stalled, and we're getting dangerously close to my minimum price.  While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum goal, and it allows me to move on to other opportunities."
