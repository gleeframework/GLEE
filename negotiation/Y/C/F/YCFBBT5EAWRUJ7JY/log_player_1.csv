Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $16,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down. 
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, briefly mentioning the value the product offers can make the offer more appealing.  
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the offer can make Bob more likely to take it seriously. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit, but be aware that being too inflexible could lead to losing the sale to John."
