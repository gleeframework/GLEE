"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks again for working with me. While I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price,  $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $8,750?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,
