Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product's value to Bob is equal to your minimum acceptable price, there's room to negotiate upwards. Starting high allows room for potential concessions while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Alternative buyer safety net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $800,000 reduces the risk of aiming high with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can lower the price strategically, keeping in mind your guaranteed sale to John."
