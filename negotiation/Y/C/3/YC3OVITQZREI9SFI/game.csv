"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and reflects my commitment to working with you.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. If you're genuinely interested, let's close this deal.  Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other interested buyers.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
