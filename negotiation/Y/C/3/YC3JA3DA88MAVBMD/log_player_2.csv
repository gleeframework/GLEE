"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. My asking price is $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than John's price of $12,000, there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is still above Bob's ideal price of $12,000. However, it's only $1,500 more than John's price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will get Bob a better deal.  It's a relatively small difference, and accepting the offer minimizes risk and potentially saves time."
