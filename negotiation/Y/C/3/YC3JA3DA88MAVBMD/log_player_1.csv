"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. My asking price is $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to try for a better price.  I believe I can get closer to my asking price if I counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
