Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** The message makes it clear I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer. I'll also keep in mind John's offer of $100 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  While I could sell to him now, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  He clearly wants the product and is willing to pay something.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial asking price.  This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still seeking a better deal than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $150 to $125, indicating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for More Negotiation:**  This price is still above Bob's offer, leaving space for potential further compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait to see if Bob accepts my counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'll need to consider whether to make another counteroffer, or to take John's offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $110 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited Upside:** While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's $100 offer. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further may take more time and effort, and I'm already close to a deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer of $110 and close the deal.  This maximizes my potential earnings given the current situation and the potential risks of further negotiation."
