"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still above my budget. Let's try $8,500. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your need to sell the product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
