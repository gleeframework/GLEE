"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going to start at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately resorting to John. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using positive language to make the offer seem appealing. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he is serious about buying the product.  This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage in the negotiation. It shows I'm not desperate to sell and allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm offering a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer.  This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Appealing to Bob's desire:** I'm emphasizing the ""discount"" from my initial offer, appealing to Bob's desire to get a good deal.
* **Setting the stage for compromise:** I'm using language like ""meet me halfway"" to suggest a willingness to compromise, encouraging Bob to counteroffer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and doesn't reflect the true value of the product.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob's willingness to increase his offer slightly shows he's still interested. This means there's room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps my leverage and allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially pushing the price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far off from what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but only to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above my minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a significant compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Setting a deadline:**  I'm suggesting that we close the deal to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 

**Important Note:**  We're getting close to the middle ground.  Depending on Bob's response, I may need to reconsider my strategy in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're already on round 6, and Bob's offers keep circling around $900,000.
* **Negotiations are stalling:** There's little progress being made, and it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer.
* **John's offer is significantly better:**  John is offering $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with the product's true value. 

While it's tempting to keep negotiating with Bob, time is a factor. John's offer provides a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirements. It's better to secure a sale with John than to risk further negotiations with Bob that may not yield a better outcome."
