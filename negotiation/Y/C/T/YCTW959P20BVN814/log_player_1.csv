{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price."
