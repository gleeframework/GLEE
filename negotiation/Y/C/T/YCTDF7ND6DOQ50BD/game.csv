"Bob, I'm offering you this product for a price of $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the amount I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  How about we compromise one last time and meet at $1,090,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product while also offering you a good deal. I'm hoping we can finalize this transaction today.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
