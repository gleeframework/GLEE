Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  How about we compromise one last time and meet at $1,090,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product while also offering you a good deal. I'm hoping we can finalize this transaction today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.
