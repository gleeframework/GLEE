{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $18,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I'm not in a rush to sell."

I'm counteroffering at $15,500.  This is only $500 above my minimum value and shows a willingness to compromise. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiation progress."
