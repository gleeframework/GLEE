"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
The offer is higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiating practice to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message aims to maintain a positive and respectful tone with Alice. 
* **Clear Intention:** The message clearly states your interest in the product while also indicating that the initial price is unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $130 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer has come down, $110 is still above your $100 budget and what John is offering.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a decent chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she's already shown flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Fair:** This counteroffer directly proposes your target price of $100. 
* **Justification:** By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" you're appealing to a sense of compromise.
* **Alternative:**  Alice knows you have the option to go with John for $100, so this offer might be enough to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can do $105 for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** While $105 is slightly above your target, it's only a $5 difference from both your last offer and John's price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better price. Alice might not budge further, and you risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves you the time and effort of further negotiation."
