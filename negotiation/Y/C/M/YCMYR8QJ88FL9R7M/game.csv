"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is an exclusive deal, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price with anyone else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.
