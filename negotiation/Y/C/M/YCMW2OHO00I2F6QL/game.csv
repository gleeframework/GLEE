"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This considers both our valuations and gets us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,500. Would you be willing to consider $10,750? I think that's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  While I'm motivated to sell, I value this product at a minimum of $10,000 and going below $10,900 would be difficult for me. Could you meet me at that price? This way, you're still getting a great deal compared to its true worth.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $10,500. Would you be willing to consider $10,550? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",10550.0,Bob,6,
