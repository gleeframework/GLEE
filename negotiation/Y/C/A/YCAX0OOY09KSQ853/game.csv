"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, $2,200,000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations is quite wide. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to drop further to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal go through.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
