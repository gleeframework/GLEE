"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. To show my genuine interest, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to negotiate, and I'm happy to work with you. However, I have to consider the value of the product and the time and effort that went into creating it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. My revised offer is $1250000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and your initial offer of $1000000. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1250000 is closer to my initial offer, I still believe there's room to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1100000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my continued commitment to acquiring this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with a little more discussion.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1250000, which would be $1175000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping we can find a slightly more agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your offer. However, I'm still not convinced that $1150000 fully reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1200000. My revised offer is $1225000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What are your thoughts?",1225000.0,Alice,7,
