This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
