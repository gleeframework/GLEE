{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd love to close the deal, $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That's a good price for both of us, and I believe we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $11,500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,500 is closer to what I'd like, it's still a bit too low. I'm going to send a counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also starting to think about John as a more viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $11,500 is a good offer, but it's still a little below what I need to get.  I'm going to counter with $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's really my bottom line.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
