"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's time to start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price is reflective of the value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$1,800,000 is still too high, but we're getting closer. Let's keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 remains beyond my limit. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,550,000, which I believe is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. This offer demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
