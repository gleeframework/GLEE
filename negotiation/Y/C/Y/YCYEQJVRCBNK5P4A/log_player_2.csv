{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $10,000 is above Bob's desired price point.
* **Alternative:**  Bob can buy the product for $12,000 from John, which is a safety net.

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price. This gives him a chance to potentially get a better deal without immediately resorting to the $12,000 option."

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still securing the product.
* **Alice's Value:**  Alice values the product at $8,000.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By offering $9,000, Bob is  showing a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Alternative:**  Bob can still buy the product for $12,000 from John.

* **Alternative:** Bob can still buy the product for $12,000 from John.

While Alice is making concessions, the price is still not acceptable to Bob. Continuing to negotiate gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a better deal before resorting to John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Minimize cost while acquiring the product.
* **Alice's Value:** $8,000. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By offering $10,500, Bob is pushing the negotiation further, getting closer to his maximum while maintaining a reasonable profit for Alice. 

This counteroffer represents a significant move towards Alice's position while still remaining under Bob's ""fallback"" price of $12,000. This could potentially lead to a deal being struck without resorting to the more expensive option."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,100 is very close to Bob's maximum, but still above his preferred range.
* **Alternative:** Bob can still buy the product for $12,000 from John. 

With only one round left, the chances of getting a better deal from Alice are very slim.  It's more likely Alice will continue to try to increase the price.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John, even at the higher price, to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
