"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to the product's intrinsic value. How about we discuss a price of $980,000? I look forward to your response.",980000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $980,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,020,000?  That's still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you, and it's closer to what I need to accept. Let's see if we can make this work.",1020000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,000,000 as the final price for the product? I believe this is fair for both of us, considering the value it holds for me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
