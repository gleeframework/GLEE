{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving some room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to the product's intrinsic value. How about we discuss a price of $980,000? I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000, especially since I have another buyer willing to pay that amount. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $980,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,020,000?  That's still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you, and it's closer to what I need to accept. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,000,000 as the final price for the product? I believe this is fair for both of us, considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and finalize the deal."
