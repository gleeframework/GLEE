Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This will give me a better starting point and allows me to potentially earn closer to my desired price. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by referencing the alternative buyer, John, without explicitly mentioning his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I have another buyer ready to pay $12,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $10,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum price of $10,000. Although I'd ideally prefer to get closer to $12,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal and potentially ending up with nothing. It's time to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
