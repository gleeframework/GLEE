Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 gives Bob a potential profit of $100,000, which is a strong incentive for him to buy. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  By stating it's a one-time offer, I create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
