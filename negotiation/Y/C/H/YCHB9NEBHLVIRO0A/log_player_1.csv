Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you value highly. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,200,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit. This price is still very attractive to Bob, as it's $100,000 less than his valuation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high offer that Bob is likely to accept and a price that yields a substantial profit for you."
