"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming for a high initial price to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $9500 is a price that Bob might be willing to consider since it's significantly less than the product's worth to him. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** I want to leave room for potential counteroffers, but I'm not risking a deal by starting too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $8,000.**  I am not desperate to sell and can afford to hold out for a better deal.
* **Rejecting gives me more control.** By rejecting his offer, I maintain the power to dictate the next price point and potentially push him closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John is not ideal.**  While $8,000 is my minimum, it's still less than I'd ideally like to get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm dropping my price slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:** This price is still above Bob's offer but below my initial asking price. It allows me to gauge his true willingness to pay.
* **Strategic Bargaining:**  By counter-offering, I maintain control and avoid giving in to Bob's initial lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While I'd like to earn more, Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he may further lower his counteroffer, potentially forcing me to accept a lower price or sell to John for $8,000.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Time is a factor. Accepting now means I can secure the sale and move on.  

It's a calculated risk, but with only 6 rounds left, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option."
