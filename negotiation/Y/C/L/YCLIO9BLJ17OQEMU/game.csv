"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is a fair compromise given my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $13,500? I think that's a reasonable compromise, considering the value the product brings.",13500.0,Alice,5,
