Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you, even more so than that price, but I'm open to discussing terms further if you'd like."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary, and Bob might accept your initial offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate while still emphasizing the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to be firm in negotiations with Bob, knowing you have a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I know I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John. I'll counter-offer to see if I can bridge the gap with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you do $12,500?  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you at that price."", 
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer aims to meet Bob somewhere in the middle. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above both my minimum and his initial offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By countering at $12,500, I'm  positioning myself just above my safety net of $12,000 from John. This leaves room for potential further negotiation if Bob comes back with another offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at a price point significantly below my minimum. While his offer increased, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. I have a guaranteed offer from John at my minimum acceptable price, so it makes the most sense to take the sure thing.  Continuing with Bob at this point is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome and might even lead to a worse deal."
