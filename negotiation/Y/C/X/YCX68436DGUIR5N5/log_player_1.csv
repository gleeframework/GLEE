Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice should start with a price closer to her desired outcome. Offering it at $80 (Bob's value) leaves no room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $110 offer allows Bob to potentially counter-offer, and Alice can still decrease the price slightly while remaining above her minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" offer adds a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**The goal is to find a price point that's appealing to Bob while maximizing Alice's profit.  Even if Bob rejects this offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.**"
