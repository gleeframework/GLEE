Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we don't want to sell ourselves short. Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Alternative:**  Mentioning John isn't necessary yet. It might make Bob feel pressured, and you have a strong alternative if needed. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price gives Bob the potential to negotiate down while still ensuring Alice gets a significant profit."
