"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for... $700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable to my business, but $700,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $650,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we settle at $620,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",620000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $640,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I propose a price of $630,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",630000.0,Alice,5,
