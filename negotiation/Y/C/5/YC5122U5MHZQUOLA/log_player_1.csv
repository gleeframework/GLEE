Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, meaning he's potentially willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 to cover your own valuation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still staying below Bob's maximum valuation. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your earnings."
