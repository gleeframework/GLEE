Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $800,000. This seems to align more closely with what I'm willing to spend. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're aiming high! While Bob's offer matches our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get closer to our initial asking price."

We're getting closer, but let's not settle just yet.  We're still aiming for a higher price. Another counteroffer is in order."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I am willing to consider $920,000 as a counteroffer. I believe this price respects the product's value while also aligning with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

```

Bob is clearly committed to negotiating, and $920,000 is a strong price. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or us leaving money on the table by pushing too hard."
