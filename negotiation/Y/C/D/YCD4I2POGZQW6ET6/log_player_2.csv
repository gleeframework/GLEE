"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it will be a great asset to you.  To start the negotiation, I'm offering it at $950,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to get a better deal. 
* **It's early in the game.**  We have 10 rounds, so rejecting and counter-offering is a reasonable strategy to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Within my budget:**  $850,000 is still within my limit, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Sets the stage:** This counteroffer establishes a starting point for negotiations and hopefully pushes Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm confident this product is worth a significant amount to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still high:** While Alice has moved closer to my target, $900,000 is still above my desired price.
* **Plenty of rounds left:**  We're only on round 3, so I have time to continue negotiating and push for a lower price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get Alice closer to my counteroffer of $850,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're confident in the product, and I am too! But $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget.
* **Emphasis on a win-win:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties, signaling a collaborative approach.
* **Sets the stage for potential agreement:** By offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, this counteroffer might lead to a faster deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. This product will bring a lot of value to you.  How about we settle at $887,500?  This feels like a fair price considering the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting close to my target:** $887,500 is only $25,000 away from my previous offer and well within my budget. 
* **Alice is showing willingness to compromise:**  Alice has moved significantly from her initial asking price, demonstrating a desire to close the deal.
* **Time is a factor:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Accepting now saves time and avoids the risk of Alice becoming more stubborn. 

While I could potentially push for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal or ending up buying from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that's still favorable to me."
