"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,000 is cheaper than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice clearly wants to sell the product and knows you're interested.  By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, which might make her lower the price further."
