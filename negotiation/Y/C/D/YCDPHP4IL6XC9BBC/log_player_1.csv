Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe you'll find immense value in it. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to sell to Bob for a slightly lower price and still make a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob. He gets a good deal compared to my guaranteed sale price, motivating him to buy now.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly eager. Even if he negotiates down a little, it's still more profitable than selling to John directly."
