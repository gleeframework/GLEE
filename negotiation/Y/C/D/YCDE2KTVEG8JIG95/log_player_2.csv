"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better deal than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This gives Alice an incentive to consider the offer while also pushing for a better deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is still cheaper than buying from John, it's not the best possible deal. Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially achieve a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise while still trying to stay below his maximum budget. This counteroffer is a good balance between showing flexibility and pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is now closer to Bob's desired price range, and the time is running out. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and allows Bob to buy the product at a significantly lower price than John's offer, while still achieving a decent deal."
