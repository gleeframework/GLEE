Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a good starting point.  It's above your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows that you're serious about getting a good price, but are open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above John's, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I still need to make a good profit.  This price is a fair compromise that hopefully gets us both closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, but it's closer to my minimum.  Selling to John would mean I would get less than what Bob is offering.  At this point, it's better to secure the sale with Bob."
