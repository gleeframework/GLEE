"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",90.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $82. Would you be willing to go down to $78? I really think this product could be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase it if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your hesitation, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a commitment to purchase the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $81. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $81. I'd like to make one last counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $79? That's my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can come to a deal.",79.0,Bob,6,
