Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you'd like."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below this threshold might entice Bob without leaving too much money on the table.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a strong fallback position. There's no need to drastically undercut the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, there's still space to potentially reach a price agreeable to both parties."
