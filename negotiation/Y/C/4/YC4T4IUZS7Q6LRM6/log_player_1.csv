"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but we're open to discussing a fair price. Given its value to you, we suggest starting at $90. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different price."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $80?  That's my absolute top price, but it would allow us both to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""price"": 80}"
