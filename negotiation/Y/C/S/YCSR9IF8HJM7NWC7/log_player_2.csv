"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000.  Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, there's room to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering $10,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. It's still within your budget and leaves some room for Alice to negotiate while still getting a profit. This counteroffer shows you're serious about purchasing the product but are looking for a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your ideal price, but it's closer to your budget.  You can still try to negotiate further and potentially get a lower price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and might lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still aiming for a price lower than $12,500, but you're getting closer to Alice's price point. Offering $11,000 demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that gives Alice a profit while keeping you within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is higher than what you initially hoped for, it's still within your budget of $15,000. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and then potentially asking for an even higher price. Accepting the current offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without further haggling and the potential for a worse outcome."
