Alice's offer:

While Alice's counter-offer is lower, it's still above Bob's budget and what John is offering. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and get the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000.

Bob should buy the product from John. Although Alice's offer is lower than her original price, it's still higher than what John is offering. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and save the extra $75,000."
