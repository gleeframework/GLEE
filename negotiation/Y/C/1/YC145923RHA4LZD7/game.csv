"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However,  $13,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",12800.0,Alice,5,
