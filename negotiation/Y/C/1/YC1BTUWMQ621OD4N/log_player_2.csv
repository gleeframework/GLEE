"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, we're extending this exclusive opportunity to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high for Bob's budget. It's wise to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness about negotiating. It's a bold move, but it's calculated.  Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than John's offer, hoping to secure a better deal. This move also puts pressure on Alice to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. We believe in the intrinsic value of our product, which is why we initially offered it at $950,000. Given the quality and features, I propose we reconsider the original offer at $900,000. This is a significant discount from our initial asking price, and I hope it brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target.  He should continue negotiating, aiming to get closer to his desired price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving him ample time to reach a satisfactory agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to show his willingness to compromise by increasing his offer, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's. This demonstrates Bob's commitment to finding a good deal, while also keeping the pressure on Alice to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am glad we're making progress. After careful consideration, I would like to offer the product to you at $875,000. This is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and your budget. I hope this proposal will help us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a significant drop from her initial asking price and is now within Bob's budget.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and the possibility of having to buy from John at a higher price ($800,000) make accepting this offer the most logical choice. It's a good deal for Bob, saving him $75,000 compared to buying from John."
