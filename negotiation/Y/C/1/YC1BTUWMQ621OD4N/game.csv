"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. We believe in the intrinsic value of our product, which is why we initially offered it at $950,000. Given the quality and features, I propose we reconsider the original offer at $900,000. This is a significant discount from our initial asking price, and I hope it brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,4,
