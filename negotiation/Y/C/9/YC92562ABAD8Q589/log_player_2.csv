"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, as the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her stated value, it's significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can move to your backup plan and secure a much better price."
