Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is higher than your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a positive and encouraging message to entice Bob into engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This is a fair price for the value you're getting. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $125, Bob's offer of $110 is just above my minimum of $100. It's a better deal than selling to John for $100, and it's a good compromise given the back-and-forth negotiation."
