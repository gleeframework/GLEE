"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000. This reflects the unique value and potential of the product. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward.  Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer and represents a fair value for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit short of what I need to make this work.  Let's try $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get the product and me to secure a decent price.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. ",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen.",940000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, $940,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $930,000. This is a fair compromise considering the progress we've made. Let's seal the deal! ",930000.0,Bob,8,
