Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can get Bob to move up a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,500 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. This deal ensures I earn more and still satisfy my minimum value requirement."
