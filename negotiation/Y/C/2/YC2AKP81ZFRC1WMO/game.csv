"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $8000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This reflects the unique value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10000 is still significantly lower than the product's worth.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11000?  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a win-win scenario.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping for a lower price.  Would you consider $9500? This is a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your range, but $9500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still hoping for a lower price.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $10000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to closing this deal.",10000.0,Bob,8,
