{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than you value it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price up or down depending on Bob's response.
* **It includes a compelling reason:** Highlighting the value to Bob helps him consider the offer seriously. 

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any wiggle room on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's important to hold firm on your minimum value, so rejecting his offer is the best decision. You can now counteroffer with a price closer to your minimum, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is significantly below what I need to sell for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm looking for a more significant discount. How about we meet at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below it. You have a safe fallback option with John, so it's best to continue negotiating with Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10,000? That way, we both get a fair price, and I can avoid selling to John for less than I'd prefer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $10000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet at $9500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While you've come down a bit from your initial price,  it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet you closer to your target.  Rather than risk further negotiation that may not lead to a better outcome,  it's best to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
