Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is significantly below what I need to sell for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10000? That way, we both get a fair price, and I can avoid selling to John for less than I'd prefer. What do you think?
