"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference once more. Would you be willing to pay $8,875? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $8,750? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the price you've already mentioned.",8750.0,Bob,6,
