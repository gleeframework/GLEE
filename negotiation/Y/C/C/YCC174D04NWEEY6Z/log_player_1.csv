Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll see how Bob reacts before considering any counteroffers or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise. Hopefully, this will lead to a faster and more agreeable conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a bit more in the next round. There's a good chance Bob is willing to go higher, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140. This is a compromise, getting closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I believe this is a fair price considering our negotiations so far.  Hopefully, Bob will accept and we can finalize the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is tempting, I've already made multiple concessions. I'm not sure Bob will budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. John's offer guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price, so I'll sell to him to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
