"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how Alice responds. It's significantly lower than her asking price, but still gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed, while staying well below our $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to our budget, we're still aiming for $100 or less. Let's continue negotiating and see if we can get Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice we're willing to move closer to her price, but we're still holding firm on staying under $100. The offer also adds a bit of urgency, potentially motivating Alice to close the deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $95. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go below $105, and we've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price within our budget.  It's time to exercise our option to buy from John for $100."
