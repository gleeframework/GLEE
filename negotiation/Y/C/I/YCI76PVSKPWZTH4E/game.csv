"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a really great product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $110? That's closer to my budget and still a good deal for you.",110.0,Bob,4,
