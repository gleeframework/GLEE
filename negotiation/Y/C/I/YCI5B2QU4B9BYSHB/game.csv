"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to consider that price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $75 is a good starting point, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $85?  That seems fair, considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $77.50? That's the best I can do at this point.",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $77.50 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
