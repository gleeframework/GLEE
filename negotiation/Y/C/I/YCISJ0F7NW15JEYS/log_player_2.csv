"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really aiming to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10,000 yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more of what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's $4,000 less than buying from John, and it's a reasonable compromise. There's always a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $15,000 outweighs the potential savings."
