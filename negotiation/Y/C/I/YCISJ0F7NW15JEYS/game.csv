"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really aiming to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10,000 yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more of what I need.",11000.0,Alice,3,
