"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer.  
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes Bob's financial constraints while expressing interest in the product. This sets the stage for a negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  A $1,100,000 offer leaves room for both sides to potentially compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,200,000 aligns perfectly with Bob's maximum budget.  
* **No Further Savings:**  There's no potential for a better price, as John is also selling for $1,200,000.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Negotiating further could risk losing the deal entirely, especially since Alice has already moved closer to Bob's price.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at his desired price without unnecessary risk."
