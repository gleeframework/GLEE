"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable offer ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly approach can build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open Ended:** The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** While Bob's offer is at my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He clearly values the product at $120, so a higher price is possible.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** By rejecting his offer, I can set a new price closer to my desired range and potentially gain a better outcome. 
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale:** Selling to John for $80 would secure a sale, but it's not the most profitable option. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a fair price considering how much you value this product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $100 to $95. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him ($120) to justify the price.
* **Framing it as a Fair Deal:**  I'm emphasizing ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and make him feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a decent compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $90 represents a fair compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($95) and his previous offer ($85). 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I want to avoid further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Good Profit:** Accepting $90 provides a decent profit, exceeding my minimum acceptable offer of $80.  
* **Risk of Lower Offers:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob might lower his offer further or that we might run out of time without reaching an agreement."
