,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to consider a price of $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this.",850000.0,Bob,4,
