"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high with $10,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. If he's interested, we can go from there. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and consider the time remaining and the option of selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit more.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. If he's willing to go higher, I'm open to it.  However, if he continues to lowball me, I'll have to reconsider and possibly sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise that's higher than Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not interested in paying a price I'm comfortable with.  I've already rejected his offer of $7,500, which is below my minimum.  There are still 6 rounds left, but I don't want to risk continuing to negotiate with him and getting stuck with a lower price.  John is offering my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him to ensure I get the price I need."
