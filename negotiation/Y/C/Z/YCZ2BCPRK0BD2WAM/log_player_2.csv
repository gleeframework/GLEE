You can do better than $90. You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make at least $92 to make it worth my while.

While $92 is closer to your target, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $90 out of this deal. Let's meet in the middle again, but this time at $90.

You've negotiated as much as you can with Alice. While you'd ideally pay less,  $90 is a reasonable price, and buying from John would cost you more.  It's time to accept the deal."
