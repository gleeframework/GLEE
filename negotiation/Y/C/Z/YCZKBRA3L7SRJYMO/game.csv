"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value you placed on the product. Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and meet at $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $100, which is fair to both of us. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
