Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum and avoids further negotiation rounds."
