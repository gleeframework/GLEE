Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also framing it as a good deal for him, hoping to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a better offer than Bob's initial value, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value.  I'm going to reject his counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I have 8 rounds left and can still sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering my financial situation, I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $10,000, which is closer to my minimum desired value.  I'm going to accept his offer.  It's better than selling to John for $15,000 and we still have 6 rounds left if I need to negotiate further with another buyer in the future."
