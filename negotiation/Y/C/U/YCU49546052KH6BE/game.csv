"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
