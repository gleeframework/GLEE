Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By starting at $1,400,000, I allow for potential counteroffers that could still be profitable for me.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the value of the product to Bob can make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counter.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes that Bob is a serious buyer and might be willing to negotiate. I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I need to meet my goal.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely secure a price closer to my target by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup:** Having John as an option gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our initial offers.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll gain from the product,  further emphasizing the fairness of my offer.
* **Clear intention:** The message conveys my willingness to negotiate but also indicates that I'm not willing to go significantly lower.

**Important Note:** This counteroffer still allows me to profit from the deal while remaining within the negotiation zone. I'm also considering that if Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can still sell to John for a higher price."
