Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that reflects that. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, the goal is to maximize profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to price it below that to make it attractive.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly while still staying above our minimum.
* **High Anchor:** By starting with a high but justifiable price, we anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between attracting Bob while ensuring we still secure a significant profit."
