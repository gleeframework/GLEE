"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $1,100,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit far off from where I need to be. Would you consider $950,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, and I appreciate your willingness to make a significant jump. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're committed to finding a fair deal, and I appreciate that. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000 even? That's a big move for me, but I'm willing to make it to get this deal done.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a big move, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,000,000.
