"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
