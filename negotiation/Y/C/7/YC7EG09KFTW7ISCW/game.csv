"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",14000.0,Bob,4,
