Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure the Sale:** While Alice has a backup buyer, there's always a chance something could go wrong. Securing a deal with Bob at a good price is the priority. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiating style or how much he's willing to pay beyond his $12,000 valuation."
