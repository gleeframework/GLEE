"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your valuation, the product's inherent worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction on my initial asking price and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,150,000. I still think the product is a bit overpriced, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
