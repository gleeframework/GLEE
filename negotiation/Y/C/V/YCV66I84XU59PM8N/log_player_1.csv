Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price significantly above your fallback option.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential"", Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her minimum.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone is not demanding, but rather invites Bob's perspective, opening the door for negotiation. 

**Important Note:** Alice has a strong fallback option (John) which gives her leverage in this negotiation. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice is still guaranteed her minimum desired amount."
