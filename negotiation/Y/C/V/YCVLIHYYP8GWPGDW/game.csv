"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to me, and still provides you with a considerable profit potential. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price still allows you to make a good profit and is closer to the value I'm hoping to get for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value you place on the product. I am willing to consider a price of $960,000. This is higher than my initial offer but still allows for a reasonable profit margin. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,
