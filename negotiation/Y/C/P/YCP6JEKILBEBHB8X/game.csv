"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure $1200000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1100000. Considering your willingness to pay $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, and I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for me. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
