Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
