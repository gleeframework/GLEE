"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
