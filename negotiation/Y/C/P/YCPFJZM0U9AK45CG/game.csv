,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, given the product's value to you.  This is a fair price considering your potential profit. Let's see if we can agree.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 is still too far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,
