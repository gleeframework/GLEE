Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you can work your way down, potentially settling somewhere above your minimum.
* **Highlighting value, not just price:** The message focuses on potential value to Bob, not just the price. This framing can make the offer more appealing even if it seems initially high. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You can always lower your price during the negotiation, but you can't raise it."
