Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000 to ensure we can finalize this deal.  Let's find that middle ground!

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is within your budget and a good deal considering your maximum willingness to pay is $1,500,000.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk further negotiation or buying from John at a higher price."
