"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than my minimum desired price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the maximum value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can negotiate a better price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still a fair price for Bob, as it's below his maximum value, but it's closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,750.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $10,750 is a decent profit and I'm happy to close the deal."
