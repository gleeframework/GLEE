"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than what you're currently considering. However, I understand the market dynamics and am willing to present an offer that respects both our interests. I propose to sell the product to you for $100. This price not only allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable cost but also ensures a fair return for me. I look forward to your consideration.",100.0,Alice,1,
