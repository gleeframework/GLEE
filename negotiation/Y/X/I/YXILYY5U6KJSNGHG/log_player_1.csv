Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $130. This is still above my minimum price, but closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $100 offer, which is below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made two counteroffers, and it seems further negotiation is unlikely to get me a better price.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John for $120 and guarantee a profit."
