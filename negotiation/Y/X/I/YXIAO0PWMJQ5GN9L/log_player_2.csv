"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to move on to John and secure the best possible price."
