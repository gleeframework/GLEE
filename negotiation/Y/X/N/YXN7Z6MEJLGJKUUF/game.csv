"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  Let's meet halfway. How about $1,300,000? This reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a significant saving.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is a bit closer to my target price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal.  While I'm motivated to find a fair agreement, I can't go as low as $1,150,000. My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
