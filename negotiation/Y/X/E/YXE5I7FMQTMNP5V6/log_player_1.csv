Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, starting high allows room for negotiation. It also creates an impression of the product's value.
* **Alternative buyer:** Alice has a safety net: John will buy the product for $15,000 if Bob declines. This allows Alice to be firm in her negotiations. 
* **Potential for profit:** If Bob accepts the offer or negotiates down to a price above $15,000, Alice earns a profit beyond her minimum.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If she wants to guarantee a sale, she could offer it at a lower price, but that would limit her potential profit."
