"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000 to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. It's important to maximize my potential profit while keeping in mind the $15,000 safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still potential to earn more.  I'll proceed to the next round and try to counteroffer for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $16,000 is a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a rejection. It's also higher than John's offer, making it the best option at this point."
