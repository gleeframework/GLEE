It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $7,500 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer of $6,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for negotiation."

Alice is still coming down in price, but I'm not quite there yet. I'll counter again to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6800}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, to $6,800. I'm getting closer to Alice's price, but I want to see if I can get her to budge a little more."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $7,300, which is getting close to my limit. At this point, it's likely that I won't be able to get a lower price from Alice, and buying from John would cost me significantly more. So, I'll accept her offer and buy the product for $7,300."
