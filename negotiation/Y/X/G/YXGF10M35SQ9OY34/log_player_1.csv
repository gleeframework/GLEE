Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also recognizing your potential return on investment.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows me to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,100,000 offer is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. I can always come down slightly if needed, still remaining above my minimum. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the price."
