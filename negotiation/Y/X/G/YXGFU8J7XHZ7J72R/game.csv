"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is excellent, that price is a little high for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000? I think it's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a good profit, while also giving you a great deal on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit much.  Could you do $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
