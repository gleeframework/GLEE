"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's too high, and he can get it for $80 from John.  It makes sense to see if he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $75.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still above what Bob is willing to pay from John.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He has more rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

Bob should offer $80 to Alice in this round. This is his maximum price, as he can buy the product from John for that price. By offering his maximum price, Bob is showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's not willing to pay any more.  This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to accept the offer or risk losing the sale."
