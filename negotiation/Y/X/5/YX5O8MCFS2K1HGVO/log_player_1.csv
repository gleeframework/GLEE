Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, even more than this asking price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still net a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer, exceeding Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaving room for him to feel like he's getting a potential deal.
* **Encouraging Language:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob's perspective. This can make him more receptive to the offer."
