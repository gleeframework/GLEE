Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,400,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a price that reflects its worth while still leaving a fair profit margin for me. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($300,000) between Bob's valuation and your minimum. 

This strategy seeks a balance between:

* **Securing the sale:**  The offer is significantly lower than Bob's valuation, making it attractive.
* **Maximizing your profit:**  You secure a $200,000 profit margin over your minimum."
