"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm not able to meet your price at this time. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. This price would be a fair deal for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit while still allowing me to save some money.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere closer to the product's value to you. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the profit I need to make.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,750. This would be a win-win scenario, allowing me to purchase the product while still leaving you a reasonable profit.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, given the product's value to me and the market demand.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still not quite there on $9,250, but I'm willing to go up to $8,875.  This is a fair compromise, allowing me to make a substantial saving while still offering you a good profit margin.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,875. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point.",9000.0,Alice,7,
