"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I'm framing it as justified due to the product's ""unique features and potential,"" subtly appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts this high initial offer, I exceed my desired profit margin.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:** His response will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate.
3. **Control the Negotiation:** By starting high, I anchor the negotiation in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 - $100,000 = $1,100,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  I'll reject his offer to signal that I'm aiming for a higher price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,100,000. It shows you recognize the value of this product. However,  $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of what's being offered.  Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? This would represent a significant but fair discount on my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and complimenting his understanding of the product's value. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Standing Firm:** While I came down from my initial price, I'm still significantly above Bob's offer and well above my minimum. This signals that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the new price as a ""significant but fair discount,"" emphasizing the value Bob would receive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation by asking if Bob is ""willing to consider"" the price rather than stating it as a final offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Push for a Higher Price:** I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my initial offer without alienating Bob.
* **Maintain Control:** I'm setting the pace of the negotiation and keeping Bob engaged.
* **Seek a Win-Win:** While maximizing my profit is the goal, I also want to ensure Bob feels like he's getting a fair deal if he agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your initial offer was $1,600,000, and you're now offering $1,350,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,350,000 - $150,000 = $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer $1,200,000 - $50,000 = $1,150,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has steadily increased his offer, and at $1,150,000, it's getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more in further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John's standing offer outweighs the potential for a slightly higher gain. It's time to accept and secure a respectable profit."
