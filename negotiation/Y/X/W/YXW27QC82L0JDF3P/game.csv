"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer you the product for $1,550,000. This still represents a good value for you while ensuring I can fairly compensate for the product's worth. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a significant investment in the product, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and flexibility.  While $1,450,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still slightly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,500,000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know if this works for you.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
