Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I still need to get closer to my desired price.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?

We're getting closer, but there's still room to negotiate. Alice is coming down in larger increments, suggesting some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your latest offer is tempting, but I'm aiming for a final price closer to $1,250,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're strategically inching closer to a price that works for us while still leaving some wiggle room. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer keeps the pressure on without being unreasonably low."
