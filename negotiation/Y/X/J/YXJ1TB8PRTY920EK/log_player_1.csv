Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you.  I'm asking $100 for it. It's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer sets a high starting point, giving me room to negotiate down.  It also expresses a willingness to work with Bob, making him more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out and have to sell to John for the same amount."
