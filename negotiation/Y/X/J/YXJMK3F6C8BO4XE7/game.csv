"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for less than its value to you, and I'll still be able to make a good profit. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
