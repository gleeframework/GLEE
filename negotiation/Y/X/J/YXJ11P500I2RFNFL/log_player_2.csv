{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You have room to negotiate with Alice, so rejecting her offer is the best move to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to start by offering my maximum price of $800,000. This is a bold move, but Alice is likely motivated to sell, and this gives us a starting point for negotiation. If she rejects this, I can still go with John, but I'm trying to see if Alice will come down to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get the price down further.  There's a chance she might be willing to go lower, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $900,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, and it's a good compromise between my maximum budget and her previous offer.  I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to her and lead to a deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $1,050,000 is still over my limit. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get the price down even further.  I'm determined to save as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm going to increase my offer again to $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope Alice will accept."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $1,025,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I've been negotiating for a while now, and I'm starting to feel like Alice isn't going to come down to my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000.  This will ensure I get the product within my budget and avoid any further negotiation."
