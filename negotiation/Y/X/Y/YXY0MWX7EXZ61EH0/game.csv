"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but I've got a budget to stick to.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as 85. How about we meet in the middle at 105? It's a great value for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about $95?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer for it at that price.  Let's get this deal done!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but 95 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price, but I need to get closer to my target. How about 102? It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",102.0,Alice,5,
