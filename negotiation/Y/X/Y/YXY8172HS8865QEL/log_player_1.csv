{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a little lower than my minimum acceptable price, but I think it's a fair offer considering Bob's valuation. It also leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I want to counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept a price this low.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price for Bob while still ensuring I get a decent amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $12000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $11500 for the product. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$11,500 is still too low for me.  It's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not ready to sell at that price.  I'll counteroffer again, and if Bob still won't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $11,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

This is my final offer.  I've come down a bit more, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  If Bob rejects, I'm going to sell to John."
