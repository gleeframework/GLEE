"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $12000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $11500 for the product. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $11500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500, which is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
