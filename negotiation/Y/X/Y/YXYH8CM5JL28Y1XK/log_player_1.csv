I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I have the option to sell to John for $100, I can afford to be a bit aggressive in the initial negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I have the option to sell to John for $100, so I have some room to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm going to counter with $105.  This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  It's still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, it's appealing enough for Bob to consider."
