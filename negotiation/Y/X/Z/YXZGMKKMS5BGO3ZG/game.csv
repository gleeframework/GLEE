"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $95 for it. Would you be interested in this offer?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $85 for the product.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'd like to try to meet you halfway. I am proposing a price of $90 for the product. I hope this will be more acceptable for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $87.50.  That's a good compromise and hopefully, we can close this deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob. I believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. Let's settle on $89 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it offers.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $89 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $88?  That's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",88.0,Bob,6,
