"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and quality.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something we can agree on.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1150000, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
