Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,200,000 from John. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for Greater Profit:**  I'm aiming for a higher profit, as Bob is a potential buyer and his value for the product is unknown.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By starting high, I have room to negotiate down if Bob expresses interest but wants a lower price. 
* **Worst Case Scenario:**  If Bob rejects, I still have John's offer as a safety net. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to pay a premium!"
