Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a competitive price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit lower, while still keeping me well above my minimum.
* **Create Urgency:**  By highlighting the product's value to Bob and calling it a ""competitive price,"" I subtly imply that he might miss out if he doesn't act.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than my fallback option of selling to John."
