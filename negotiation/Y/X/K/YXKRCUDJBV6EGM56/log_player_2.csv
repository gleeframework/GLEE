Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. I'm hoping to get Alice to come down a bit from her initial price."

While $11,500 is a good deal, I want to see if I can get Alice to go even lower. I'll try another counteroffer."

Alice is moving a bit closer to my previous offer.  I'll try one more counteroffer, but if she rejects that, I'm likely to accept the next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going up again by a small amount.  This is a compromise, and if Alice rejects it, I'm ready to accept the next offer she makes."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is getting very close to my previous offer, and I'm likely to run out of rounds before I can make a counteroffer and get her to go lower.  It's time to accept the deal and save some money over buying from John."
