"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that is still below its true worth.  Consider it carefully. If you choose to decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
