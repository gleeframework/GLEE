**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,350,000, which is less than the $1,500,000 John is asking. 
* **You can still save money:** While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, you can still acquire it for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
