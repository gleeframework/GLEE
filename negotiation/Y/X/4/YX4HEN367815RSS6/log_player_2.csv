"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors and contribute greatly to your success. The product, valued at $1,200,000 to you, holds immense potential for transformation and growth. I am extending this offer to you with the hope that we can collaborate and create value together.

To facilitate this partnership, I propose a transaction price of $1,150,000. This price reflects my commitment to ensuring a mutually beneficial arrangement while also allowing me to recoup the significant investment made into the development and acquisition of this valuable asset.

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and if you would like to proceed with further discussions. I am here to answer any questions you might have and to explore how we can make this product work for both of us.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice.  Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $1,200,000."
