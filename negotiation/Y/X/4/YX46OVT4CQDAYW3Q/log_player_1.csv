Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 allows for negotiation room and still gives me a good profit.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message builds rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This price will give me an idea of Bob's willingness to pay. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $80, so there's no pressure to accept a low price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  While $85 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $80.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Counteroffer:** I can counter with a price closer to my desired $100.  
* **Plan B:**  John's offer provides a safety net.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint:**  This price is a midpoint between my last offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85.
* **Fairness:** I'm positioning this as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Profit:**  $92.50 is still significantly above my minimum of $80 and provides a good profit margin. 
* **Finality:**  This counteroffer may be my last one before accepting John's offer if Bob rejects again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90.  Let's make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  $90 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and represents a good profit.
* **Near Agreement:** Bob's offer is close to my counteroffer of $92.50, indicating we are nearing an agreement.
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away, and then I'd have to settle for John's offer of $80.

It's better to secure a deal at $90 than to risk getting only $80."
