Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. While I appreciate Bob's attempts to compromise, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $10,750. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and represents a fair value for the product based on its worth to you. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum price of $12,000. I've already made several compromises and it doesn't seem like we're going to reach an agreement.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a price I'm comfortable with."
