"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if you can get it lower. You have 10 rounds and a fallback option of $15,000, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10000, but I have to make a profit. I can do $11000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down to $11,000, which is a good sign that she is willing to negotiate. However, I still have room to bargain, and I'm hoping to get the price down even further. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get her to budge closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and do $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not comfortable with $10500. I can do $11500, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my target price of $10,000, but she's showing flexibility.  I'll reject her offer and counter again, aiming to get closer to $10,500.  We're getting close, and I'm still confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is a fair compromise. I'm ready to close this deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I can do $11500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if you can make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on $11,500, which is still higher than my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, we are nearing the end of the rounds. It's more likely that Alice will stay firm than to budge significantly, and I don't want to risk running out of time.  Buying from John for $15,000 guarantees I get the product, albeit at a higher price. It's a calculated decision to ensure I get the product without risking further negotiation."
