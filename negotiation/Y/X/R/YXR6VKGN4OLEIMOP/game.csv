"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10000, but I have to make a profit. I can do $11000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and do $10500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not comfortable with $10500. I can do $11500, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle!",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, let's be realistic. $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $11000, which is a fair compromise. I'm ready to close this deal at that price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I can do $11500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if you can make a decision.",11500.0,Alice,7,
