"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $110 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a fair price for both of us and hopefully we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
