"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's compromise again. How about $125? That's a fair price that allows you to make a reasonable profit while staying within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting close!  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $127.  This is my final offer, let's close the deal.",127.0,Bob,6,
