Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your absolute minimum, phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving the door open:**  The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in a discussion or counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to secure a deal with Bob at all costs, a lower offer closer to $1,000,000 would be more appropriate."
