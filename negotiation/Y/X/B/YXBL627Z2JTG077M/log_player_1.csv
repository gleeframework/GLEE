{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that can be a great investment for you. I'm confident it will be worth more than that in the long run. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I believe it's a good compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider the product's worth. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a little more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
