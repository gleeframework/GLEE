"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's clearly not a deal you can accept.  You'll need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far beyond what I'm able to pay.  Considering the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it falls significantly short of the product's true value and my minimum selling price. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet halfway. How about $1,200,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit. You need to push for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original counteroffer of $800,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
