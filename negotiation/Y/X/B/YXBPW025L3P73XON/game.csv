"Alice, your initial offer is far beyond what I'm able to pay.  Considering the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it falls significantly short of the product's true value and my minimum selling price. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet halfway. How about $1,200,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original counteroffer of $800,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
