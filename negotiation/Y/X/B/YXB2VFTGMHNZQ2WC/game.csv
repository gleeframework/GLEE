"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price of $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price below $15,000, and I'm willing to meet you there. I can offer it to you for $14,500. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",14500.0,Alice,5,
