Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) and gives me some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $100, so I have nothing to lose by trying to get a higher price."
