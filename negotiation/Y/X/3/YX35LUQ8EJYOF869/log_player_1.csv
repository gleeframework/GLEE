"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's a good compromise between my minimum value of $15,000 and Bob's perceived value of $8,000. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* This offer gives me a good starting point for negotiation, while also leaving room for potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's initial $8,000, it's still significantly lower than what I would ideally like to get. I believe there's room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better price.

I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and proceed to the next round. I'll try to counter with a price that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would give you a great deal, and it would be a fair compromise for me. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500** is a midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* The message is positive and focuses on the benefits for both of us. I emphasize the ""great deal"" Bob will get, aiming to make the offer more appealing.
* I'm trying to maintain a sense of urgency, suggesting we ""make this work"". This implies a willingness to finalize the deal but also adds a bit of pressure to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum value than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I would ideally like to get. 

I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and proceed to the next round. 

There are two key factors driving my decision:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob has indicated a willingness to compromise.
* **Value of Time:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to explore higher offers before resorting to selling to John for $15,000.

In the next round, I'll aim to counter with a price that's closer to my desired range, while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us.  It's a fair deal that allows you to stay within your budget while also providing me with a reasonable return. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a compromise, slightly higher than Bob's offer but closer to my desired range than my previous counteroffer.
* The message emphasizes the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and emphasizing the benefits for both parties. 
* I've removed the ""urgency"" language from the previous round, opting for a more neutral tone. 
* I'm hoping that by offering a middle ground and highlighting the fairness of the deal, Bob will be more likely to accept in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I need to stay within my limit. Can we meet at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,800 is still lower than my ideal price, it's only $200 away from my minimum value of $10,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob increases, potentially leading me to sell to John for a lower price than I'd like. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision. It allows me to secure a sale within a reasonable timeframe and avoids the risk of having to settle for a lower price with John."
