"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay that much more than its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This still represents a significant value to you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my final offer before I consider other options.  What's your decision?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $862,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer is now only slightly below my minimum acceptable price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal to another buyer."
