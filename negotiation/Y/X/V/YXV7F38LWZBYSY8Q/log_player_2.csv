"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $700,000 for it to make sense for me.  What can you do?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the  value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're still pretty far apart.  That price needs to come down significantly for me to consider it.  I can do $800,000, but that's absolutely my limit."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but  $800,000 is far below what I can accept. I'm willing to make a significant move to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value while recognizing your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated that $1,600,000 is her final offer. This is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at your target price."
