Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $700,000 for it to make sense for me.  What can you do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
