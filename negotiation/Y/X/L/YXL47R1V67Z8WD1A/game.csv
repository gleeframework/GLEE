"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $15,500 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500, which is a fair price given my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This would allow us both to reach a fair agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
