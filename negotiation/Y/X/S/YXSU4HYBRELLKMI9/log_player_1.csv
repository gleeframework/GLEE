Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to profit. If Bob rejects, I can then consider adjusting the price or selling to John for a guaranteed $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is still a bit higher than Bob's last offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate but also shows that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has gotten closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiations.  At this point, it's safer to sell to John for the guaranteed $80."
