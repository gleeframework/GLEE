Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $15,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is a significant drop from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $15500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe we can still find a more favorable price. I'll counteroffer again, but will be more careful with the price reduction. I'm also starting to consider the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm willing to go down to $16,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the reduction in price. I would like to counter with a price of $15750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

We are now in round 6 out of 10.  I've already made several concessions, and Bob's offer of $15,750 is close to my minimum.  It's a risk to continue negotiating, as we might not reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up, and I might be forced to sell to John at $12,000. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
