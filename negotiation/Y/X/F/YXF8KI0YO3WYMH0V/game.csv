"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $12,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we discuss a price of $12,500? It's a small increase from your offer, but it gets me closer to where I need to be.",12500.0,Alice,5,
