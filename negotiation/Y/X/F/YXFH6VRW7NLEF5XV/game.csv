"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  However,  $11,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? ",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is still a great price for you and gets me closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
