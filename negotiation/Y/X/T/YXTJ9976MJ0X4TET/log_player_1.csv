Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite steep. This product is valuable, but not at that price point.  I'd be willing to consider $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

We're still significantly under the product's value to both of us. It's worth pushing a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here. Let's close this gap –  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a minimal concession for a product of this caliber."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to meet me a bit more on this.  Would you consider $1,000,000 even? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has met my minimum threshold, and it's better to secure the deal now. There's always a risk he could walk away in later rounds."
