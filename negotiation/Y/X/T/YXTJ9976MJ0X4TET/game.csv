"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite steep. This product is valuable, but not at that price point.  I'd be willing to consider $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. Let's meet halfway – I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have my limits.  How about we settle at $950,000? That's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here. Let's close this gap –  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a minimal concession for a product of this caliber.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
