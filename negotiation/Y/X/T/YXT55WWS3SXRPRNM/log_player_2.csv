# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a great deal, but there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is a good compromise and saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation is high, as Alice might be unwilling to budge further."
