"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $10,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,800. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still quite a bit below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $10,150? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $9,600. Can you meet me at that price?",9600.0,Bob,6,
