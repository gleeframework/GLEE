"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit. I can do $140, and that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $135 again, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll include a free accessory with the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",135.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $132, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I'll do $138, and I'll throw in an additional free accessory to sweeten the deal. That's my final offer.",138.0,Alice,9,
