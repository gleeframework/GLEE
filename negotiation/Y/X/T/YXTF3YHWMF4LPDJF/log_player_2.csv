"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Value to you:** You value the product at $150.
* **Alice's offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $140.
* **John's price:** John is selling the product for $150.

Accepting Alice's offer means you get the product for $10 less than you would from John.  This is a better deal for you."
