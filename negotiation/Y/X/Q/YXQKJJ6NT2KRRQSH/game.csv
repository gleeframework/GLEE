"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle - how about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $2,000,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go to $1,800,000. This shows a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
