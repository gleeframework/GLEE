"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,600,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe in finding common ground.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept $1,450,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and allows us to move forward.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I'm willing to consider $1,375,000 as a fair compromise. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower counteroffer of $1,350,000. I believe this still reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
