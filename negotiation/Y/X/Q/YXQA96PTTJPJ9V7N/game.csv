"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,
