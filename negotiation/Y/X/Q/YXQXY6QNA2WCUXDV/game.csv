"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for future collaboration. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $10500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to go down to $10000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9200. I'm willing to meet you at the halfway point between our previous offers, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9200.0,Bob,6,
