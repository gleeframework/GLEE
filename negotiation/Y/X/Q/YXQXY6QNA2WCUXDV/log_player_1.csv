{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This leaves room for negotiation, and allows me to potentially secure a higher price than Bob's initial assessment.  If he rejects, I can either counter-offer or move on to John, who's willing to pay my full asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range.  I'll counter-offer, aiming for a price somewhere between Bob's $9,000 and my initial $12,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for future collaboration. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $10500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I'll counter-offer again, hoping to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to go down to $10000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9200. I'm willing to meet you at the halfway point between our previous offers, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still interested in selling the product to Bob, the negotiations are getting increasingly time-consuming.  I've already made several concessions, and Bob's offer of $9,200 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's clear that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement that works for both of us. To ensure I don't lose out on a valuable sale, I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 offer from John."
