"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10000. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
