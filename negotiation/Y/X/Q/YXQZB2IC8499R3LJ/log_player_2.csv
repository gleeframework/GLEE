"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10000. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but still higher than you want to pay. There's still room to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer seems like the best option."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  How about $11,000?  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is still a good deal for you compared to buying from John for $15,000. Further negotiation might get you a lower price, but it's unlikely you'll get much closer, and the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and leaving you with the more expensive option from John is too high. Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice at this point."
