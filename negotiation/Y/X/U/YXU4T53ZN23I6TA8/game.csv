"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe the product's value to me is lower than your minimum value, and I'd like to get a better deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $775000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is at least $800000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to go up to $725000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $725000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $750000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
