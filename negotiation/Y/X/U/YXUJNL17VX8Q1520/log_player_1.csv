I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to him and more than my minimum of $100.  I'm confident he'll find this a good deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept such a low price yet.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."

I'm countering with $130. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to my desired price than his offer, but still lower than my initial offer. I believe this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit."
