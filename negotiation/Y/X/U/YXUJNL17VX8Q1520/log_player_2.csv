"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is a good price, you can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for both of you to find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $140, but it's still within your budget.  It's a good starting point for further negotiation, as it shows you're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is a good deal for you. It's lower than your maximum budget of $150 and allows you to save $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
