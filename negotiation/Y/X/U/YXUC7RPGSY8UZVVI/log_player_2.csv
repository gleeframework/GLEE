You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you the product for $84. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
 
At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $84 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of her raising the price or the negotiation failing altogether."
