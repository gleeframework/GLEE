Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Offering the product at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob and presents the offer as a special opportunity.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Bob may counter-offer, knowing his maximum value is $10,000. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go.
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point (selling to John) will help you."
