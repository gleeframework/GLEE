"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, hoping to get a better deal.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $160. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer and my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $145 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering $155. This is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway. I'm feeling confident about this offer and I'm ready to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is exactly my minimum acceptable price and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal. It's better to secure this sale than to risk a counteroffer that could result in a lower price or a failed deal altogether."
