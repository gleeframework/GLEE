"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $100. You have the opportunity to negotiate a better deal and save money. By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a profitable deal for her.  Starting with a lower offer increases the chances of a successful negotiation and provides space for both parties to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still above your target price of $100. While it's closer to your desired price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step down than the previous one, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within your price limit.  The offer of $87.50 is a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating a genuine attempt to reach an agreement."
