"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is above Bob's perceived value of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a good starting point, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $150.  I will reject his offer and see if I can get him to move higher.  If I can't, I have the option to sell to John for $150."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $140 for this product.  It's a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer, $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not ready to give up yet and will see if I can push him higher.  If he doesn't budge, I can still sell to John for $150."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of room for negotiation.  I can't go lower than $135.  This is a fair price, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're running out of room for negotiation, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to pay $120, and that's my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made his final offer at $120. This is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've already rejected several of his offers and am running out of time.  It's better for me to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
