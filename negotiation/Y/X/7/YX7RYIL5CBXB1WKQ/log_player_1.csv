I'm still trying to get a better price than $150 from Bob. It's risky, but there's a chance he'll come closer."

I'm choosing to sell to John. It's clear that Bob is not willing to go much higher than $80, and with only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I can get a better price.  It's time to take the guaranteed $150."
