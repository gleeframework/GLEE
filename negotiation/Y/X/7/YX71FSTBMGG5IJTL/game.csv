"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is far too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  This is my absolute top offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $12,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500? This would be a win-win situation, as you'd get a great product at a fair price, and I'd be closer to my target.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get a fair deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a solution. While $11,500 is closer, it's still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a compromise for both of us. This is my final offer before I consider other options.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $12,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. If you don't accept this offer, I'm afraid I'll have to go with another seller.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of time and I want to make sure we can reach a deal. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 one last time. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",13000.0,Alice,9,
