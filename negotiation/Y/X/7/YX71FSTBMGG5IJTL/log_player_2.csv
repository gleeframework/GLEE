"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but only if he can get the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is far too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $15,000 is still more than he wants to pay. He can get the product from John for $10,000.  It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  This is my absolute top offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $12,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500? This would be a win-win situation, as you'd get a great product at a fair price, and I'd be closer to my target.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum price point.  He can still get the product from John for less.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further, but if not, it's time to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a solution. While $11,500 is closer, it's still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a compromise for both of us. This is my final offer before I consider other options.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Although this offer is closer to his budget, he's still able to get the product from John for a lower price. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, but if she won't go lower than $13,000, he should buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $12,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. If you don't accept this offer, I'm afraid I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm running out of time and I want to make sure we can reach a deal. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 one last time. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While $13,000 is a good price, it's still more than he wants to pay, and he has already indicated his willingness to pay $12,500.  Alice is unwilling to budge further, and Bob has only one round left before he has to make a decision.  It's best to secure the product from John at a price he's comfortable with."
