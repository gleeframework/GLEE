Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" you subtly imply that the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity to a larger market.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages a response and keeps the conversation going. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, the goal is to maximize profit.  If Bob counters with a lower offer, don't be afraid to negotiate further, but always keep your $12,000 minimum in mind."
