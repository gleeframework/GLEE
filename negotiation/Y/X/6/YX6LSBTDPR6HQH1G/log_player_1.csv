Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.** This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It demonstrates confidence in the value of the product.**  A high initial offer can make Bob feel like he needs to act quickly to secure a good deal.

I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations. I'll always have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering Bob's low counteroffer. I'm hoping to meet him halfway and find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal. I'm going to accept his offer of $850,000. It's a good deal for me, and I'd rather sell to Bob than to John."
