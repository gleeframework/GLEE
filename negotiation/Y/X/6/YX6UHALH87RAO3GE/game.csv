"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial price is a bit high for me.  I would be willing to consider a purchase price closer to $1,100,000.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your number. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,250,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, finding a middle ground is important.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd prefer.  How about we settle on $1,175,000?  I feel this represents a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing that we're getting closer in our valuations.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price.  Would you be open to considering $1,210,000?  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true value of this product.",1210000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,210,000 is getting very close, however, I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,190,000?  I think this is a fair deal for both of us and would allow us to close this out today.",1190000.0,Bob,6,
