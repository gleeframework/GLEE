"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to jump at it right away.  You can try to negotiate a lower price. It's possible Alice is willing to sell for less, especially if she's eager to get rid of the product."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $7500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $8500?  It's still a great deal considering the value of this item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but there's still room for negotiation.  While I can afford $8,500, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'll try to meet her halfway in my next counteroffer."
