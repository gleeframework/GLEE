Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob's higher valuation allows me to aim for a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) but still leaving room for Bob to find it attractive compared to his $1,500,000 valuation. 
* **First Refusal Advantage:** By offering Bob the first opportunity, I create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, increasing the likelihood of him accepting a price closer to my target.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit even if Bob rejects the initial offer."
