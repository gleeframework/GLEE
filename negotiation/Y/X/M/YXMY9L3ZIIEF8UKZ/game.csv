"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12800, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can you consider this offer?",12800.0,Bob,4,
