"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $875,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",885000.0,Alice,5,
