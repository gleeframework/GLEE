"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $11,000. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above your minimum and leaves room for me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  However, I know the true value of this product.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $11,000 to $10,500. This is a good price for Bob, as it's still lower than what he's willing to pay John ($12,000) and leaves some room for profit. It's likely that further negotiation won't bring the price down significantly, so accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
