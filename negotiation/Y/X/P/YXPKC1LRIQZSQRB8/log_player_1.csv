Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay that amount. This will give Bob a clear understanding of my starting point and set the stage for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation while remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this price is fair and will encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my acceptable price, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000.  This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to reach an agreement with Bob before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if he'll accept any higher price. To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of time, I'll sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
