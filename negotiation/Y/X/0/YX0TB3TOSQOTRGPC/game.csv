"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $11,500, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and allows me to earn a fair price. Let's meet in the middle!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
