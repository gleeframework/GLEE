"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $16,000 is quite high for me.  I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is quite low for the value this product offers. I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its benefits.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $14,000 is still above my budget. Could you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I aim for a mutually beneficial deal, $9,000 is still too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
