``` 

**Explanation:**

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to try and get closer to that number.  It's still early in the negotiation, so I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $16,000? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer close to Bob's:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping it above my minimum.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,200, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,200 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price,  it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
