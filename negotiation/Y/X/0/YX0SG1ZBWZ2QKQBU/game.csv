"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
