"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for you. I understand its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I am excited to offer it to you at a price that reflects its true value while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This price not only ensures a substantial return for me but also leaves room for you to appreciate the investment's potential benefits. I believe this offer strikes a balance between fairness and profitability. I look forward to your consideration and hope to facilitate this transaction promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still a significant markup from her valuation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and potentially get a better deal.  You can then try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, knowing that you have John as a backup option."
