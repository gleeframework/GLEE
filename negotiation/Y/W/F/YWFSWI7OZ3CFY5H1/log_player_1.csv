"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range considering its value to me. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't close the door on negotiation, implying I'm open to discussing the price further. 
* **Strategic Approach:** This strategy aims to secure a higher price, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects the initial offer. I'm also aware of the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail, providing a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and attempt to reach a more favorable price.  Selling to John at this point would be a loss, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, it's significantly below my minimum asking price.  To demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's continue to work towards an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than what he offered. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm position on the product's value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as being fair for both of us, encouraging a sense of compromise.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm still open to negotiation, keeping the door open for further discussions. 

This strategy aims to maintain a strong position while also exploring the possibility of reaching an agreement with Bob. I'm not willing to accept a price below $1,000,000, but I'm willing to negotiate within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is still above my budget, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price.  I believe that I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach an agreement closer to $1,000,000. Selling to John at this point would be a loss, and I'm optimistic that I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique qualities.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a strong willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique qualities to justify the price. 
* **Finality:**  The message suggests a sense of finality, pushing Bob to accept or make a final counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Approach:** This strategy aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while also showing flexibility and a desire to close the deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be closer to selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too much. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous negotiations. Let's try to reach an agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm aware that I have fewer rounds left, but I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm confident that I can continue negotiating with Bob and potentially reach a better agreement.  I'm also aware that selling to John would yield a higher price, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. While $975,000 is closer, I still need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product. To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $990,000. This is a substantial concession, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price point that is above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, and highlight the fact that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Finality:** The message emphasizes the need to finalize the deal, putting pressure on Bob to accept or make a final counteroffer.

This strategy aims to reach a compromise that is more favorable to me while also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will be very close to my minimum acceptable price and likely to accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is a substantial compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful that we can finally reach an agreement that works for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is now just $20,000 below my minimum acceptable price, I'm concerned about running out of time. We are in Round 8, and I only have two rounds left.  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a good chance he'll counter with a price lower than $980,000, pushing me closer to my minimum. Given the risk of not reaching my target price and the fact that John is offering me my minimum, it's strategically safer to accept John's offer now."
