{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my minimum price of $120 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little closer to my asking price. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep a little profit."", ""product_price"": 110}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While $100 is still better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can convince him to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm really hoping to get closer to $110. Could you meet me halfway at $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a little more on the sale."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I would like to counter with $102 for the product. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's still below my ideal price,  $102 is close enough.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk selling to John for only $120 when I can secure $102 now."
