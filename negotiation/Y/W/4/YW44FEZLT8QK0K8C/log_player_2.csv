{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the initial price.  Since I'm aiming to save money, I should start negotiating. Even if I don't get a better price from Alice, I can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This is a strong initial negotiation tactic, showing Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal. It also leaves room for further negotiation in the following rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, I'm still aiming for a lower price. There's no reason to accept yet since I have more rounds to negotiate and John is always an option if I can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show some flexibility while still pushing for a price lower than Alice's current offer. This allows for more bargaining space in future rounds and keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still determined to try for a lower price. I've got more rounds left and John is a viable backup, so there's no need to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, showing a willingness to compromise. This time, I'm proposing a price that's right in the middle of Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates a good faith effort and increases the likelihood of Alice accepting.  I'm still hoping for a lower price, but I'm getting closer to a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my previous counteroffer. I'm getting a significant discount compared to the initial price and John's offer.  With only a few rounds remaining, it's time to accept this offer and secure the product.  There's a good chance Alice might not budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
