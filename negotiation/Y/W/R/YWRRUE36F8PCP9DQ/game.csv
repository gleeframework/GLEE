"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to make you a deal. How about $90?  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $85?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?  That way, we both get a good deal.",82.5,Bob,4,
