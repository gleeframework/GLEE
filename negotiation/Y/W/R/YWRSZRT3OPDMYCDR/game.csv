"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value this product brings.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This leaves room for both of us to profit, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this investment. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - can you consider $925,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase it if we can agree on this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
