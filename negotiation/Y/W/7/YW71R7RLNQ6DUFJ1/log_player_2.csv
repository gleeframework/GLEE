"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-time offer, so you won't want to miss out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than John's price of $150, it's still significantly higher than your $150 limit. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity for Alice to potentially propose a lower price, bringing it closer to her own valuation of $80."
