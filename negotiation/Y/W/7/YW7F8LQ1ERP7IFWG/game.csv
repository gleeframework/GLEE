"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see that we're both serious about this deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe we can close the deal right now.",9500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,200. That's the highest I can go.",9200.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,200 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $9,350. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",9350.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",9000.0,Bob,6,,
