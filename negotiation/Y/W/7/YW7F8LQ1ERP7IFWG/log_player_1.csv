"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly message helps to build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the product's usefulness reinforces the value proposition for Bob. 

I'm aiming for a compromise in the next few rounds, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $9,000 is closer to my floor, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round. 
* **No need to rush:** I have 10 rounds, and selling to John is always an option. There's no need to accept Bob's offer just yet.

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to secure a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see that we're both serious about this deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe we can close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the fairness and value of the price, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Urgency:**  Suggesting a quick close can help to nudge Bob towards accepting. 

This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable option while keeping me close to my target. I'm hoping this is enough to secure a deal and avoid having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,200. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $9,200 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** We are still early in the negotiation process, and there is room for Bob to raise his offer.
* **Potential for better deal:** While selling to John is always an option, I believe I can get closer to my desired price if I continue negotiating with Bob.

I will counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer. This will hopefully encourage Bob to raise his price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,200 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $9,350. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing losses:** While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm willing to lower my offer again to show good faith and keep the negotiations moving. 
* **Finality:**  Mentioning ""other options"" implies I'm getting close to my limit and creates a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the compromise aspect to make the offer seem more reasonable. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to secure a deal with Bob. If not, I'll have to weigh my options more carefully and consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited time:**  We've already gone through five rounds, and it's becoming clear that we are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, and it's the most sensible decision at this point.

While I'd prefer to secure a deal with Bob, I cannot afford to continue negotiating and risk losing out on a guaranteed sale."
