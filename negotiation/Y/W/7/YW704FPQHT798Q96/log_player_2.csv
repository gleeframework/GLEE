It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can potentially get a better price than $8,000 from John."

I'm offering Alice $9,000. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice has lowered her price to $10,000, which is within my budget.  It's not the ideal price, but it's a good deal considering I can get it from John for $8,000.  I'll accept Alice's offer."
