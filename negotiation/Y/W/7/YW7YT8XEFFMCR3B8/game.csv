"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a bit more flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a reasonable middle ground, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest,  $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going. Would you be open to $975,000?  That would make this a done deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I understand this is your final concession, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and close the deal at $1,000,000 even? This would be a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're so close to a deal. However, I've already made a significant concession, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000, which is what I offered in round 5. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
