"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise that benefits both of us. I believe it's a great deal for you, and it's the final price I'm willing to offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
