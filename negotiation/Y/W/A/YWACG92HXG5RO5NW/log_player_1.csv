"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer positively, emphasizing the opportunity and value for Bob. 
* **Opening for Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to negotiate, showing I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while giving Bob room to counter-offer. It's important to keep in mind that if Bob rejects my initial offer, I can always turn to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is more than Bob's initial value of $800,000, it is significantly lower than my desired price and even below John's offer.  

I will reject Bob's offer and counter-offer in the next round to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price while still holding onto a significant portion of my desired value.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's true value to justify my price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation alive and potentially moving closer to my desired price. If Bob still refuses, I can always resort to selling to John in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 

Since I have John as a backup buyer, I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob.  By rejecting this offer, I can counter-offer again and try to push the price even higher. There are still 6 rounds remaining, so I have time to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this unique product. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise that benefits both of us. I believe it's a great deal for you, and it's the final price I'm willing to offer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:** I'm adding a sense of finality to my counteroffer by emphasizing this as the final price I'm willing to offer. This increases pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm reframing the negotiation as a win-win scenario, highlighting that this price is good for both of us. 
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise slightly, I'm still keeping the price above John's offer. 

This strategy aims to push Bob to make a decision. If he rejects this offer, I can comfortably move to selling the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I've already made significant concessions and reached the point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. 

With only 4 rounds remaining, it's time to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. This ensures I meet my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially lowering the price."
