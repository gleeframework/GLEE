"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a really high-quality item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $150?  That's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident I can find something similar from John for that price.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $225. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",225.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your compromise, but $225 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $175. That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps me within my budget. What do you think?",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $200. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,5,
