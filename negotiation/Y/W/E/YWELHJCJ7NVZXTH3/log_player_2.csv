**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to immediately demonstrate his seriousness about negotiating a lower price.  $1,100,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise. This counteroffer also shows Alice that Bob is prepared to walk away if she doesn't come down in price."
