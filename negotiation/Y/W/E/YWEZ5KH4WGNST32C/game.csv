"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a great chance to acquire something truly special. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1250000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement with you.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1300000. Can you consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
