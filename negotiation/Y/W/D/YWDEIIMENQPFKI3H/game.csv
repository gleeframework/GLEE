"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $115?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  $115 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $110.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more.  $112 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
