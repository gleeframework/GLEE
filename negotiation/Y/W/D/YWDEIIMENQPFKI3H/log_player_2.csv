"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $135 is too close to my budget limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $115?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  We're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. I think we can get her down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $115 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $110.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 108
}
```

We're getting closer! We are pushing a bit below the ""split the difference"" point, but it's still a reasonable counter-offer that keeps us below our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more.  $112 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice seems firm on her price, and $112 is a solid savings compared to John's offer or Alice's initial price."
