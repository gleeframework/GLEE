"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,025,000? It's a fair price considering the value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still not able to go above $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
