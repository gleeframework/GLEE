"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer. He also has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Bob needs to start with a strong counteroffer to show Alice he's serious about saving money.  $950,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Justification:** Bob emphasizes the product's value to him, suggesting that his offer is fair given his perspective. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message acknowledges the need for compromise and leaves the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,025,000? It's a fair price considering the value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice has already come down from her initial price, but Bob can likely still get a better deal.  $1,025,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price, and he can try to negotiate a lower price.
* **Value to Bob:**  Remember, the product is only worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so he shouldn't pay more than that unless he's desperate. 
* **John is an option:**  Since Bob can buy from John for $1,000,000, he has a safety net. This gives him leverage to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still not able to go above $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Bob is now firmly stating his maximum price point, demonstrating his seriousness about getting a deal. 
* **Highlighting John:**  Bob is subtly reminding Alice that he has an alternative, putting pressure on her to accept.
* **Final Offer:**  This gives Alice a clear decision point.  If she rejects, Bob will move on."
