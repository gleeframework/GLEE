Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum threshold, and I think I can do better with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still allows for a good profit margin for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,325,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still not quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000, which is a fair compromise and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,340,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to offer $1,330,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum, and I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to take a good deal now than risk getting a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John at a lower price."
