"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $1300000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1225000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still slightly higher than your maximum price point. You can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can agree on this price, I'd be happy to close the deal today. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1200000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1225000 and $1200000. I'm proposing a price of $1212500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,212,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,212,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not clear if you'll be able to negotiate her down any further. It's a better strategy to buy from John, who is offering the product at your desired price."
