"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $1300000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1200000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1150000 for the product, which is still a significant amount for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1225000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1225000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can agree on this price, I'd be happy to close the deal today. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1200000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1225000 and $1200000. I'm proposing a price of $1212500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
