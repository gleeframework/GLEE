# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has 9 more rounds to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum price.  He has 7 more rounds to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and it's a good compromise between our positions."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is a 3% discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's within his price range, and with only 5 rounds left, it's a good deal.  He can always try to negotiate further with Alice, but with the risk of her rejecting his counteroffer and potentially going back to her initial price, it's best to take the offer."
