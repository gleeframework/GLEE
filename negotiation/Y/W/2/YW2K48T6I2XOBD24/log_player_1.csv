Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.  While I'm aiming for as much as possible, I'm not unrealistic. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to sell, I'm not desperate. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."

I'm lowering my price significantly from my initial offer, but I'm still above Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also ensuring I don't sell too far below my minimum."

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's significantly higher than Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will encourage him to meet me halfway."

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it's taking too long, and I'm losing time.  I'm going to sell to John, as it's a sure thing and guarantees a profit."
