"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. I can likely negotiate a lower price, so I will reject her offer and make a counteroffer."
