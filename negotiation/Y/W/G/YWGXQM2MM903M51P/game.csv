"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects its potential value while also allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This considers both its potential for you and a fair return on my end.  Let me know what you think.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,225,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,162,500.  This offer is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you say?",1162500.0,Bob,4,
