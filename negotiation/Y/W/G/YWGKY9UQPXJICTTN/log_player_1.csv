"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal for you! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
This is my initial offer to Bob. I am starting at my minimum acceptable price, knowing that he values the product at $80. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm getting closer to my ""Sell to John"" point.  I'll counteroffer and see where we land."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  $125 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference at $130.  If this isn't acceptable, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a sale, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $122 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but we're running out of rounds and $122 is still below my threshold.  I'm going to sell to John for $150.  It's a guaranteed sale and a better price."
