,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm going to counter with $950,000. This price is still fair given the product's value to you, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know if you're open to this.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and a price I believe represents a good value for you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
