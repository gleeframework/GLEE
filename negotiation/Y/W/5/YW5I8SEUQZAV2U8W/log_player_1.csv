I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm going to counter with $950,000. This price is still fair given the product's value to you, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  That's a fair compromise in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While $875,000 is closer to what I'd like, it's still too low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.
