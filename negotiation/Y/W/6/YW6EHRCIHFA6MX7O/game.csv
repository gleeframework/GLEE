"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm definitely interested. However, $1000000 feels a bit low considering its value to you. I'm willing to pay $1100000, which is still a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to let it go for $1100000. Considering its value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to pay $1075000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",1075000.0,Bob,4,
