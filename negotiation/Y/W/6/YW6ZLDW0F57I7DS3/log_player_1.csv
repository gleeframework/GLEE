Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to me, I'll try to get as close to that as possible. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $110}

This is a reasonable offer, considering the product is worth $80 to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $90. Since the product is worth $120 to me, I'm not thrilled about selling it to Bob for $90. However, I don't want to give up the opportunity to sell the product just yet.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than $90, but still lower than the $120 I'm looking for.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": $100}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send my counteroffer to Bob. Since he was willing to pay $90, I'll increase the price by $10 to $100. This is still a reasonable offer, considering the product is worth $80 to Bob.

{""product_price"": $100}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make another counteroffer!"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my counteroffer again! He's now offering $95, which is still lower than the $100 I was hoping for. However, I'm not willing to give up yet.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer again. I'll make another counteroffer that's slightly higher than $95, hoping to get closer to my target price of $120.
