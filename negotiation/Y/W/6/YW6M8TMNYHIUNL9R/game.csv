"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering we're both trying to make a deal here. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
