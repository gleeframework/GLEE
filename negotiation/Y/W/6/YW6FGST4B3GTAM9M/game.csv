"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and you get it for a lower price than I would sell it to someone else. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,250 is still too far below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop my price to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. Let's make this happen.",8750.0,Alice,5,
