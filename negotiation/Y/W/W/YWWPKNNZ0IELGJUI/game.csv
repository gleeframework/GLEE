"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm motivated to find a solution, but $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I can accept. Let's settle this at $15,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. If you're serious about making a deal, I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
