Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm motivated to find a solution, but $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I can accept. Let's settle this at $15,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise."",
""product_price"": 15000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. If you're serious about making a deal, I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $12,000 is a reasonable compromise.  While holding out for $15,000 is tempting, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and we risk him walking away altogether. Accepting $12,000 secures a profit and avoids the risk of a no-deal scenario."
