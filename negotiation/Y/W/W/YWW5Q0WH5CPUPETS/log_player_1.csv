Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers, justifying the high price.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency might push Bob to accept quickly without overthinking. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit by potentially securing a deal significantly above your minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John at your desired price."
