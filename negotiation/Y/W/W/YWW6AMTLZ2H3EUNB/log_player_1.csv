{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and giving Bob a fair price. Here's why:

* **My perspective:** I'm still getting a good price for the product, as I can always sell it to John for $1,000,000 if Bob rejects my offer.
* **Bob's perspective:**  Bob is getting a discount of $100,000 from the product's value to him, making it a potentially attractive deal.

This offer is likely to be accepted by Bob, as he is getting a discount and I am still getting a good price."
