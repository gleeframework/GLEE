Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth even more in the future.  I'm willing to part with it for $180. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Starts High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $150, starting higher leaves room for negotiation or allows you to meet his valuation exactly with a ""discount.""
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value can make the price more palatable.
* **Direct & Clear:** The offer is straightforward, avoiding any confusion.

It's important to remember that this is just one approach.  You could experiment with different prices and messages to see what works best in your negotiations."
