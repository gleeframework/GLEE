{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While selling to John guarantees your desired price, Bob's offer of $800,000 is his highest yet and aligns with his product valuation. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above your minimum threshold and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome or a stalled deal."
