Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

This is a good starting point.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to you, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $18,000. You can always go to John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
