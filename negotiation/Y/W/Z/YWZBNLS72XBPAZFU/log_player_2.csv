"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment.  I'm asking for $1,000,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll look for a better deal.
