"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. How about we aim for a price closer to the value it holds for you? Would you consider $95 for now?",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you understanding its value to me. However, $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product to both of us, how about we aim for a price closer to $80, which is right in line with your valuation? Would $82 be acceptable to you?",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $82 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit over my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $80? That's my absolute top limit, and it's right at the value I place on the product.",80.0,Bob,4,
