"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be worth a maximum of $800,000 for me. I'm willing to offer you $500,000 to make this a worthwhile deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Clear Explanation:** I've clearly stated my maximum valuation and presented my offer as a win-win.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** By offering $500,000, I'm signaling that I'm serious about purchasing the product but also expecting Alice to move from her initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down considerably, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate further, and it's worth seeing if she'll come closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a point where this makes sense for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious but keeping it well below her current offer. 
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  $700,000 is a significant increase from my last offer and a good compromise that still allows me to save a substantial amount.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm using simple language to convey my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be willing to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $750,000 is only $50,000 over your absolute maximum, and it's unlikely Alice will come down further.
* **Time Pressure:** Alice is signaling that this is her final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Better Than John:** While you could buy from John for $800,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000."
