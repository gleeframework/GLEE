Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $140 is higher than Bob's $120 value, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $140 is still above your $150 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

By starting at $140, you're setting the stage for a potential negotiation that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I believe we could reach an agreement at $130. However, if you're not willing to go below $135, I will consider purchasing the product from John for $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come closer to your desired price, he's still not willing to meet your minimum of $150. At this point, you've already gone down from $140 to $135, and further negotiation might not yield a better result. Selling to John for $150 ensures you get your minimum price and avoid further negotiation."
