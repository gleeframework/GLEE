Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special discounted price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you get more than your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning a ""special discounted price"", you imply the offer might not last, potentially encouraging Bob to accept."
