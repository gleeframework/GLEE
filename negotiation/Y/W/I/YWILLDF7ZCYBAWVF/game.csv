,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $120 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $90. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway from $100, so how about we try $95?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $92.50, which is halfway between our last two offers. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $92.50, but I'll try to meet you halfway from $95. How about we try $92.75?",92.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $92.62? This is a small compromise that could get us both closer to a deal.",92.62,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get close to my minimum price, Bob. I'll try to meet you halfway from $92.75, so how about we try $92.69?",92.69,Alice,9,
