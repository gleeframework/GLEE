# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, as it allows Bob to acquire the product for a price he's comfortable with."
