Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than your minimum selling price.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential price ceiling. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to sell to John for $80, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message indicates he's interested but price-sensitive. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but not at any price. You'll aim for a counteroffer slightly above your minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but the product's value is still quite high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. It shows you're willing to compromise but also holds firm on a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help you understand how much more Bob is willing to budge on the price.  If he accepts, you've got a great deal. If he rejects, you can consider a smaller concession or move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on a price of $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. While you could try to push for a bit more, $100 is a solid profit margin above your minimum. It's often better to secure a good deal than risk losing the sale by being too inflexible."
