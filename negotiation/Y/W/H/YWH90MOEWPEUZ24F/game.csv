"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my costs.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. However, I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is as low as I can go while still making it worthwhile for me to sell the product to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $780,000?  This keeps us fairly close to the middle ground between our positions.",780000.0,Bob,6,
