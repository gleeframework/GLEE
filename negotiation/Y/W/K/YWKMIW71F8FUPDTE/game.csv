"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500?  That's a fair compromise that still allows me to cover my costs.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $14,500? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget. Can you consider it?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $15,000?  That's my final offer, and it's the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,5,
