"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $149 is close to your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply going with John's offer."
