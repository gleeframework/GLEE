"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
