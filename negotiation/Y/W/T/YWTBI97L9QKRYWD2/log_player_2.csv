"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her value of $800,000 but still far above my ideal price. I can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering and negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum value. This should signal my serious interest in buying while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,100,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I can still potentially negotiate a better price, and I'm not yet at a point where buying from John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer because it's a good compromise point, above Alice's value but below her offer.  This shows my seriousness while leaving room for further negotiation. It's important to be consistent and not jump around with offers, as this can make it harder to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $1,050,000 is within my acceptable range. This is a good deal for me, especially considering the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a higher price or a stalemate. I'd rather secure this deal at a price I'm comfortable with than risk a worse outcome."
