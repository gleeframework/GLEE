"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. I believe it's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let's find a middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1750000, which would be $1625000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep talking. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1675000. This shows I'm serious about making a deal with you, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1675000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider that?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1637500?  This is a fair compromise that allows me to move closer to my asking price while still offering you a good deal.  Let's get this done!",1637500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1625000, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",1625000.0,Bob,8,
