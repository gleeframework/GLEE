"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $115 is still within Bob's budget of $150 and is closer to his desired price than John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, and Bob has already made a counteroffer. Accepting the offer avoids further rounds and potential delays.
* **Risk:** While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or simply walking away from the deal is present. It's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk missing out entirely."
