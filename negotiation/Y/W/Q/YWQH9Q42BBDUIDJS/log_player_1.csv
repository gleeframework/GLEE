Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,199,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1199000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you aim to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** Offering it just below John's price ($1,199,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Limited Information:** Bob doesn't know about John, so this price might seem reasonable given the product's worth to him ($1,000,000).

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts, and you make a profit of $199,000 (over your minimum).
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects, and you sell to John for your guaranteed $1,200,000."
