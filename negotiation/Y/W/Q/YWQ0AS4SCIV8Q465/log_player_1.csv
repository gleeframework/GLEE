Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, you need to give Bob a reason to accept your offer instead of walking away.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll see. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,450,000 is a strong starting point within the ZOPA, giving you room to negotiate if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone is collaborative (""I believe..."", ""What do you think?""), suggesting you're open to discussing the price further, potentially increasing your chances of securing a deal with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  You could adjust your strategy and offer based on Bob's perceived negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
