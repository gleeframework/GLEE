"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can work out a price that benefits us both.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This gives you a good price, and I can still make a reasonable profit. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000, but that's as high as I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're firm on your price. While I'm not happy to drop this low, I'm willing to go down to $10,250 for a final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,250 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but we're getting close to a stalemate here.  $9,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to move on.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already offered to meet you at $9,750, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",9750.0,Bob,8,
