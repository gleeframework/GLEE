"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is still quite high. There's room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the market."",

}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a firm starting point for the negotiation and signals that I'm serious about buying, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice is coming down, but the price is still higher than what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However,  $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway between our previous offers. It keeps the negotiation moving while staying within a reasonable range of John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm prepared to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to you, and it allows me to secure a reasonable return. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is now only $50,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for such a small potential saving. John's offer of $1,200,000 is a sure thing at this point."
