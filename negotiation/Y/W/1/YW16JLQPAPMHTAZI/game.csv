"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit higher than your offer, but still a good compromise. How about $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $11000.  Is that something you'd consider?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $11250. This is my final offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
