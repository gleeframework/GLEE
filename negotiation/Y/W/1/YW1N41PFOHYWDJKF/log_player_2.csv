"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly below the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) and even lower than Alice's own valuation ($1,200,000).  Bob should try to negotiate a better price. There's room for improvement without immediately resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly lower than the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Justification:** This counteroffer is a significant jump from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for Alice to profit, as it's less than her own valuation ($1,200,000).
* **Message Tone:** The message is polite but firm, emphasizing the value Bob sees in the product. 
* **Strategic Approach:** This counteroffer tests Alice's willingness to negotiate and sets a higher starting point for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at her own valuation:**  She's willing to sell at $1,200,000, which means she's not making a profit, but she's also not losing money. This is a good sign that she's serious about making a deal.
* **Significant savings for Bob:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers. There's no guarantee that Bob would get a better price in subsequent rounds. 

Given the above, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice.  It secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's and allows Bob to avoid further negotiation, which could lead to a stalemate or worse."
