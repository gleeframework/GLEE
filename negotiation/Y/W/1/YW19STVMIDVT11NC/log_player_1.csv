"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you're serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your initial asking price. You have 8 more rounds to reach a better deal. By rejecting, you can continue to negotiate and potentially get closer to your desired price of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your target price. You have 6 more rounds to negotiate and potentially get closer to your desired price. You've already shown flexibility and a willingness to compromise, so rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $120, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I really want this product. I'll meet you halfway between our last offers and go to $118. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $118 is just $2 away from your minimum acceptable price of $100.  You've already made significant concessions and with only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely you'll get a significantly better offer from Bob. It's time to secure the sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
