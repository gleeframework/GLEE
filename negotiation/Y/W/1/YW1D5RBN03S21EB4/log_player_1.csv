Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and my offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (Anything less and you're better off with John).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, offering it for that price would be a ""take it or leave it"" scenario, with no room for negotiation.  We want to give the impression there's a potential deal to be made.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,650,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,650,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message implies flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue. This makes him feel more in control and open to making a counter-offer.

**Important Note:** If Bob outright rejects this initial offer, you have the security of John's offer at $1,500,000. You can then decide whether to slightly reduce your price to entice Bob or proceed with selling to John."
