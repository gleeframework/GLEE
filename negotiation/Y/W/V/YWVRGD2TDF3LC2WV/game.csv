"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's make a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can we try $9,750? That would be a great compromise for me.",9750.0,Bob,4,
