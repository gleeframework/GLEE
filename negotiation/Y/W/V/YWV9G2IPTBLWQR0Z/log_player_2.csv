"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further.  The potential savings make it worthwhile to continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,800 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference and settle on $10,650. I'm confident this will be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your point, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10700. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,700 is just slightly above Bob's ideal price point, but it's still a significant savings compared to John's offer of $12,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product and avoid further negotiations.  There's always a chance Alice might become more rigid in future rounds, and Bob could end up paying more."
