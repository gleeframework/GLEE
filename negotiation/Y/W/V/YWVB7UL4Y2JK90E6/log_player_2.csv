"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating my price target.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired price range while keeping me below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,500 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my alternative offer of buying from John. There's no further room for negotiation unless I want to risk losing the deal entirely."
