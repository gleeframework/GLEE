"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. Would you like to buy it from me for $140?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $145?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $135.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $135 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we try $142.50?",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $137.50. It's closer to your last offer and still within my budget.",137.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $139, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm hoping you'll take it.",139.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $139 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $138.  This is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can agree on it.",138.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $139, and you're still not meeting me at that price. I'm starting to think we're not going to come to an agreement. I'm going to have to consider selling to someone else.",139.0,Alice,9,
