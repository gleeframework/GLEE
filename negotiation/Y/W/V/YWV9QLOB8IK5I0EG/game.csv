"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I understand that's above your budget, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
