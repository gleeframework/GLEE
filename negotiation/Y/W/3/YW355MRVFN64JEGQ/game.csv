"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,000 is my final offer.  This is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth.  Let's make this deal happen.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a slightly higher offer of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
