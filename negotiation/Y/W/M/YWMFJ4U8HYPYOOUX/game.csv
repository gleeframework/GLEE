"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Could you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going much higher than that.",11200.0,Bob,4,
