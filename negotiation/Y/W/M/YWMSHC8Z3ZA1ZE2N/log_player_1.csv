Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob is serious about purchasing the product, and this price might be attractive enough to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering Bob's latest offer. I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,725,000 is still above my minimum of $1,500,000 and getting closer to my desired price.  It's getting late in the negotiation and risking another round might result in a lower price.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
