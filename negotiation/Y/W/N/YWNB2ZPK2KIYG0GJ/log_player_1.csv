Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's valuation is irrelevant:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price ($150), Bob's valuation of $80 doesn't factor into your decision. 
* **Maximize profit:**  You aim to earn the highest possible price. Offering it to Bob at your minimum acceptable price ($150) gives you the best chance to maximize your profit. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While unlikely, there's a small chance Bob might accept your offer of $150, even though he values it lower. People sometimes value things differently for personal reasons.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are indifferent between selling to Bob or John, as long as you receive $150."
