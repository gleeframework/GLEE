Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and your keen interest, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a rare chance to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so you can afford to aim high with Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  Starting with a significantly higher offer tests his willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusivity"" and ""rare opportunity"" to justify the high price, potentially playing on psychological factors in decision-making.

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $1,500,000 offer, giving you a significant profit.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer. You sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000 â€“ no loss compared to your minimum acceptable price."
