Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can aim high with Bob. Starting at $1,200,000 gives you significant room for negotiation. 
* **Justification for the price:** While not revealing specifics, the message hints at the product's ""immense value,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Exclusive opportunity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" can make Bob feel like he's getting something special and might be more willing to pay a premium. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., whether he's easily put off by high prices), you can adjust your approach.
* **Market demand:** While you have John as a backup, understanding the broader market demand for your product can inform your strategy. If similar products sell for significantly more than $800,000, you could push for an even higher price."
