I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point, allowing me to potentially maximize my earnings while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. There's a chance I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for potential profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob has been insistent on his price, and it's clear that he's not willing to budge. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid further back-and-forth."
