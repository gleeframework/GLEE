"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming high to maximize profit. Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain over our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and John's offer.
* **Gauge Bob's Enthusiasm:** The message is framed positively but doesn't reveal how low we're willing to go. This lets us assess Bob's eagerness and potential counter-offer. 
* **Time is Money:** While we have 10 rounds, we don't want to drag it out unnecessarily. A strong opening offer can lead to a quicker, more favorable resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant profit, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's offer indicates strong interest, but it's significantly below his perceived value of $1,200,000. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  We demonstrate that we value the product highly and aren't desperate to settle.
* **Encourage a Higher Counter:** Bob is likely to increase his offer, moving us closer to a more favorable outcome. 

We're willing to risk continuing negotiations for now, as the potential gains from a higher sale price to Bob outweigh the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional and $950,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm above the $1 million mark.  A significant concession encourages reciprocation.
* **Justification:** Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces our position and justifies the higher price.
* **Clear Target:** The ""$1,025,000"" acts as a new anchor point. By framing it as a compromise (""halfway""), we nudge Bob towards that figure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but given my budget constraints, I cannot agree to $1,025,000. Let's aim for a compromise at $975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows continued interest. While $975,000 is tempting, we're still leaving a significant sum on the table knowing the product's value to him. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Test Bob's Resolve:**  We need to assess if he's willing to cross the $1 million threshold. It's possible he's holding back to see how low we'll go.
* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Even a small increase from Bob's offer will result in a significantly better outcome than John's $800,000.

It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of continuing negotiations with Bob currently outweighs the guaranteed sale to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on a price of $1,000,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budgetary concerns."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm at the $1 million mark, signaling this is our bottom line.  It's a strong, round number that projects confidence.
* **Understanding Tone:** We're maintaining a collaborative tone (""find a solution""), emphasizing that we want to close the deal.
* **Pressure Point:** By framing it as a final offer (""settle on""), we're subtly increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. 

At this stage, we're balancing the potential for a higher offer from Bob with the risk that he might walk away. The $1,000,000 represents a significant profit and a reasonable compromise."
