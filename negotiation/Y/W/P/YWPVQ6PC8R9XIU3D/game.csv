"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm not quite ready to pay that much.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase from John at that price if we can't reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering $1,075,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John for $1,200,000.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
