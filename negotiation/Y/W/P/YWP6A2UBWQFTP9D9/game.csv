"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? That would work better for my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
