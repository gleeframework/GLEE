"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price. I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
