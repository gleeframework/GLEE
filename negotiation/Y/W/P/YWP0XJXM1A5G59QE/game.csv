"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. This is a premium product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - I can do $15500. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. I can do $16000, but I'll throw in a special bonus package that includes additional features and support. This is a one-time offer, so what do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
