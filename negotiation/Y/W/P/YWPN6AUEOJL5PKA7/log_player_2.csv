"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, but I can get it from John for that price.  Alice's offer of $100 is too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than I'd like, but it's lower than John's price, and it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'll accept her offer."
