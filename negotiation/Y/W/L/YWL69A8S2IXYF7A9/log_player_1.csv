"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my earnings while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a good price for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's interest and demonstrating willingness to compromise. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $8,750? It's the best I can do at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price in the following rounds. I'm also considering the time constraint and the potential of selling to John for $10,000, which will be a significant advantage for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show that I'm still willing to negotiate, but also to test Bob's willingness to compromise. By emphasizing the value of the product and offering a fair price, I'm hoping to motivate him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $9,000? It's the best I can do at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $10,000, I'm running out of time and Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting close to my minimum. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent price and avoids the risk of losing out on the sale to John or having to lower my price further."
