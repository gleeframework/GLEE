"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above your target value of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $700,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still higher than her minimum value of $800,000. This is a bold move, but it's designed to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly. If she rejects, we can gradually increase our offer until we reach a point where we're both happy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is within my acceptable range of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or John's price changing is too high. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids potential complications."
