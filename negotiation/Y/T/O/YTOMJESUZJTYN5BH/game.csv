"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great price for this product, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
