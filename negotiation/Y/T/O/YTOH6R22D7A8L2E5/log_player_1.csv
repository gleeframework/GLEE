{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer starts with a reasonable price that's higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a little lower than what I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle from $80? Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum of $80 and closer to my desired price point. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a fair price without risking losing the sale to John."
