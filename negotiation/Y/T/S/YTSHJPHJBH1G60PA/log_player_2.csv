You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $1,200,000.  You can get the product from John for the same price.  Since there is no benefit to buying from Alice at this price, you should reject her offer and buy from John."
