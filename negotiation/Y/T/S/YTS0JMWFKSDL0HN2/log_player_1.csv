Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This offer is designed to maximize profit while still leaving some room for negotiation with Bob. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. This means he has a $500,000 margin for profit. 
* **My Minimum:**  I need at least $1,000,000. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup offer from John for $1,000,000. 

By offering $1,400,000, I am:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Bob still has $100,000 in potential profit. This makes the offer attractive.
* **Maximizing my profit:** I'm making $400,000 more than John's offer.

This approach balances maximizing profit with the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob."
