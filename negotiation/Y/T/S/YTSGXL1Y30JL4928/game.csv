"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's closer to my initial offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to save as much as possible on this purchase.",9800.0,Bob,4,
