```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within my budget and only $15,000 away from my last counteroffer. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a reasonable price and allows me to avoid the potential of a higher price from John."
