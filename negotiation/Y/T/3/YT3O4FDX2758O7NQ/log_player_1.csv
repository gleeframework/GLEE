Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be of great value to your business. My initial price is $1,200,000.  This reflects the unique benefits and potential for growth this product offers. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than the product's value to both Alice and Bob.  Alice should aim for a higher price, and there are still more rounds to negotiate. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but Alice can potentially earn more by continuing with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. While I value your interest,  $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value it brings and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's continue discussing to find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to Alice's desired price, it's still below the $1,000,000 she knows the product is worth to Bob. Alice can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  There are still rounds left, and she can use those to try and get a price closer to her target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to meet halfway. However, $950,000 still falls short of the true value of this product, considering its unique benefits and potential. To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm offering a final price of $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both understand this product holds."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $975000. I think this is the maximum I can go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit from this investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be realistic about the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below the $1,000,000 Alice knows the product is worth to Bob. While there are still rounds left, it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is unwilling to meet Alice's price point.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially a lower price, Alice should take the safe option and sell to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees a good return and avoids the risk of losing out entirely."
