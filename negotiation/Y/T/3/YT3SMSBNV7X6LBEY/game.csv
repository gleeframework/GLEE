"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is a fair price, it doesn't fully reflect the value and potential I see in this product for your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a slightly reduced price of $1350000. This would still allow you a significant profit margin and allows me to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1350000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
