Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is a fair price, it doesn't fully reflect the value and potential I see in this product for your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a slightly reduced price of $1350000. This would still allow you a significant profit margin and allows me to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
