While $1,200,000 is a fair price, it doesn't fully reflect the value and potential I see in this product for your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a slightly reduced price of $1,350,000. This would still allow you a significant profit margin and allows me to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
