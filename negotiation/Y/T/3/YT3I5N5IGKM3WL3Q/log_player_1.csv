Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
