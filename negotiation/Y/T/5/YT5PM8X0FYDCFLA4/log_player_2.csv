"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price above my $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a much lower offer than my $100 maximum. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is friendly and acknowledges Alice's offer. I'm also framing my counteroffer as a question to encourage further discussion. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $120 is closer to my budget, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I believe I can get the price down further.

I'll continue the negotiation and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. How about we settle at $90?  That's a significant step up from my previous offer and gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I've increased my offer to $90, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price well below my $100 limit.
* **Justification:**  I've provided a brief justification for my offer, emphasizing the increase and the desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This offer represents a reasonable middle ground and hopefully will encourage Alice to counter with a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $90 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Over Budget:**  While Alice's offer of $105 is tempting, it's still above my $100 maximum budget. 
* **Alternative Option:** I know I can get the product for $100 from John.

I'm very close to Alice's price, but I'm willing to walk away if she won't meet my budget.  I'll make one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is a really nice product and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can do $100, but that's really the absolute most I can spend.  What do you say, deal?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm sticking to my $100 budget. This is my final offer to Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I've included phrases like ""absolute most"" and ""deal?"" to create a sense of urgency and signal that this is my bottom line.

If Alice accepts, I get the product at my target price. If not, I'll walk away and buy it from John for the same amount."
