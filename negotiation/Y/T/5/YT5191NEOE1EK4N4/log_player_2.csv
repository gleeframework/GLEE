"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I'm keen to find an agreement, the product's value to me is quite significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a considerable return on your investment.

While Alice's offer is better than her initial offer, there's still room to negotiate. You're still above your desired price point and John's offer is always an option.  A counteroffer will likely bring you closer to your target."
