"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Given my own valuation and the market for this type of product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I'm keen to find an agreement, the product's value to me is quite significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a considerable return on your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but  I'm still a bit over my budget.  How about we settle on $1,075,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
