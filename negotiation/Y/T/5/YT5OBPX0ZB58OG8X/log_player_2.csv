Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,550,000. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below her stated minimum.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation when you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John."
