{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth attempting to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This shows my willingness to negotiate while also highlighting that her initial price is unacceptable."
