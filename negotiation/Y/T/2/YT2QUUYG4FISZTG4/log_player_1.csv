Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both room to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my target.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but  $1,050,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go to $900,000. This represents a substantial compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price point for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my target. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again, but I'll also throw in a small concession: I'll cover 50% of the closing costs. This should sweeten the deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
