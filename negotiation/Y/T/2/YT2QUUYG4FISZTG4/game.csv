"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both room to make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my target. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but  $1,050,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go to $900,000. This represents a substantial compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price point for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my target. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again, but I'll also throw in a small concession: I'll cover 50% of the closing costs. This should sweeten the deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
