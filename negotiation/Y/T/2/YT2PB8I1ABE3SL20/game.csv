"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $600000. I'm willing to consider a price of $700000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm sorry, Bob, but I've already made my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than $670000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",670000.0,Alice,9,
