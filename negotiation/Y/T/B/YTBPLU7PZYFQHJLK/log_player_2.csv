"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's valuation of $1,200,000 but lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.** This means there's potential to negotiate a lower price.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice or buy from John as a fallback option.** Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer gives you more flexibility."
