"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. If you're interested, let me know.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is far below what this product is worth. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your potential gain.",850000.0,Alice,3,
