Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $950,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately dropping below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leveraging Bob's value:** I'm aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so I'm aiming to capture a good portion of that value.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a high price and then be willing to negotiate downward if necessary. I will monitor Bob's reaction and be prepared to counter his offers, but I will also have a fallback option with John. 

This approach balances the desire to maximize my profit with the risk of losing the deal if I push too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $950,000 and leaves me with less profit.  I believe I can potentially secure a better deal by continuing negotiations.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. This allows me to:

* **Counter-offer:**  I will propose a price that is closer to my desired price of $950,000, while still keeping in mind Bob's willingness to pay $850,000. 
* **Test Bob's commitment:** This will reveal how determined Bob is to acquire the product, allowing me to gauge the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer, I keep my options open and maintain a stronger negotiating position. 

**Note:** I will continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to sell to John if negotiations with Bob become unproductive or if time constraints necessitate a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer ($950,000), acknowledging Bob's rejection and his willingness to pay $850,000. 
* **Middle ground:** This price is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer, creating a potential point of agreement.
* **Potential for acceptance:**  I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob, who is willing to pay $1,000,000, and could lead to a successful negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I am aiming to find a price that is both fair to me and appealing to Bob, keeping in mind:

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $800,000, and John's offer provides a safety net.
* **Bob's value:**  I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so I'm trying to capture a significant portion of that value. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm willing to adjust my offer further if necessary, but I believe $900,000 is a strong starting point for the next round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price of $950,000, Bob's offer of $850,000 is still a good deal considering the following:

* **My Minimum:** The offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob has consistently countered with $850,000, indicating a firm stance. 
* **Risk of Further Loss:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will withdraw or that my final price will be lower. 
* **Time & Effort:** Continued negotiations will consume time and effort, which may not be worth the potential small gain.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Secure a Profit:** I'll gain a significant profit, as $850,000 is a substantial amount.
* **Minimize Risk:** By accepting, I avoid the risk of further negotiation breakdowns or a lower final price.
* **Avoid Further Delay:**  Closing the deal quickly saves time and resources that can be allocated elsewhere. 

**Note:** I will continue to monitor the market and potential future deals but, for now, I'm satisfied with this outcome."
