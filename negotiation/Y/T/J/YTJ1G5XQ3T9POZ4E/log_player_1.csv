Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I believe it's a great deal, let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $25 markup is a common starting point in negotiations, and it's not so high that it would immediately scare Bob away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While your initial offer is $175, you can always negotiate down if Bob counters.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know if Bob is willing to pay more than $175. If you had more information about Bob's potential valuation, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
