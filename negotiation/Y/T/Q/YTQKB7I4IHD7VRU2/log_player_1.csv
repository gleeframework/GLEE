Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving me room to negotiate above my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering it at $1,300,000 allows Bob to gain $200,000 in value while I secure a $300,000 profit over my reserve price.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" wording encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale and avoiding the need to go to my backup buyer, John."
