Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to make this deal happen for you at $1,450,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and ensures you'll reap substantial benefits from it."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is a strong offer that still leaves me with a significant gain. It's considerably higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but might entice him given the potential for future gains.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:**  Positioning the offer as exclusive adds a sense of urgency and value, potentially swaying Bob's decision.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John at my guaranteed price, ensuring no potential loss."
