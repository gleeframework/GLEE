"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $7,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $8,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, $8,100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $7,900. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've already made two concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,100. However, I'm willing to throw in a sweetener to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance service, which is worth $200. So, considering the additional value, I'm willing to meet you at $8,000. This is my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,7,
