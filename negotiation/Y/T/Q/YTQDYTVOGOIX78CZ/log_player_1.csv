"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to bargain while still securing a profit. It's important to be polite and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $7,500, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $8,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,250. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $7,800 is closer to my target, I'm still within the 10 rounds and haven't exhausted all my options.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
