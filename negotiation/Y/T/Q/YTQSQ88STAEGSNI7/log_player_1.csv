{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel valued.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know that I'm open to discussion. This encourages him to make a counteroffer. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximizes potential earnings:** By starting high, I maximize the potential for a higher sale price.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  The starting price is still below my minimum, so I can make concessions without losing too much.
* **Encourages a back-and-forth:** The friendly approach and openness to negotiation encourages Bob to participate actively in the process.

**Next steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his counteroffer. I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $8,500 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to compromise my minimum profit margin at this stage.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This will give him a chance to reconsider, but I'll still be able to protect my interests.  I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, but I'm still firmly above Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to see it as a win-win scenario.
* **Reinforcement of interest:** I reiterate my interest in selling to Bob to show him that I'm motivated to reach an agreement.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Finding middle ground:** This counteroffer seeks a compromise that could be acceptable to both of us.
* **Maintaining leverage:** The price is still above Bob's initial offer, giving me some leverage in the negotiation.
* **Staying close to my minimum:** $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose too much if Bob accepts.

**Next steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll consider making a final counteroffer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $9,000.  Let's try to work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown persistence and is clearly interested, his offer of $9,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant financial loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob. I'll propose a price closer to my minimum, but I'll also reiterate that I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if we can't find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product and I appreciate your persistence. To be honest, $9,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  If you're truly serious about buying, I can come down to $11,000. This is my absolute bottom line, so I hope you'll consider it. If you're not able to meet this price, I'm afraid I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:** I clearly state that this is my ""absolute bottom line"" to create a sense of urgency and push Bob to make a decision.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate my interest in selling to Bob, but I also highlight the value of the product, subtly reminding him that he might lose out if he doesn't agree.
* **Prepared to walk away:**  I explicitly mention that I have other options, making it clear that I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if needed.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Pushing for a deal:**  This final offer creates pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Protecting my minimum:**  $11,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a reasonable profit.
* **Managing expectations:**  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to move on to John, setting a clear boundary for the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to my final counteroffer. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
