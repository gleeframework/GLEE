"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $850,000?  This is a fair price, given the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both sides.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,
