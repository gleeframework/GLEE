"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $900,000, which would be $1,050,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
