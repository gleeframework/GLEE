Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $15,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter with a lower price, but you can still likely settle on a price higher than your baseline of $10,000.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price without being overly aggressive. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
