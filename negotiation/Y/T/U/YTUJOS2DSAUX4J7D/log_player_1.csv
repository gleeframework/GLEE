"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a high anchor point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** The high starting point provides ample room for me to negotiate downwards over subsequent rounds if needed, while still aiming for a price well above my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will give me insight into Bob's negotiation style and how eager he is to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $500,000 to start. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $500,000 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($800,000). This suggests he has significant room to move. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me. It's more strategic to counter and continue negotiating.  I'm confident I can get a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $500,000 is significantly below market value for a product of this caliber.  Let's find a more realistic middle ground. I could consider coming down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** While I'm significantly reducing my asking price from the initial offer, I'm still aiming high. This signals flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to prevent Bob from anchoring too low. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By making a substantial reduction, I'm prompting Bob to engage more seriously and hopefully offer a counter closer to my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a significant jump.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is getting closer to his perceived value, but it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. Accepting would be a substantial financial loss.
* **Negotiating Room:** We are only in Round 4 of 10. There's ample time to negotiate, and Bob's incremental increases indicate he's willing to pay more. 
* **John Option:** While selling to John is always an option, I'm confident I can secure a deal with Bob closer to my desired outcome. It's too early to concede and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right that $1,900,000 is a substantial move, and I appreciate you coming up from your initial offer. To show I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This feels like a fair reflection of its value."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making another significant price reduction, this time by $300,000, to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Holding Firm:**  However, I'm holding firm above the $1,500,000 mark, which is my absolute minimum.  
* **Encouraging a Move:** By making a notable concession, I'm hoping Bob recognizes my commitment to reaching a deal and responds with a significant offer closer to my target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on. How about we settle in the middle at $1,150,000? This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal while recognizing the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a significant improvement and tempting, but it's still below my $1,500,000 threshold. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With four rounds left, I need to apply pressure to see if Bob is willing to meet my minimum. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'll use the guaranteed offer from John as leverage in the next round, indicating my willingness to walk away from the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer willing to offer me $1,500,000.  However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. My final offer is $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making a smaller concession this round, signaling that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Introducing John:** I'm subtly bringing in John's offer as leverage without making it a direct threat. This emphasizes that I have a viable alternative if Bob doesn't meet my needs.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By presenting a ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency for Bob to act if he wants the product.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:**  While my final offer is $100,000 below my guaranteed sale price, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter and still provides me with a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other offers, and I respect your final offer. I'm willing to come up to $1,000,000. This offer reflects a strong commitment on my end while acknowledging the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Budge:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 indicates he's unwilling to come close to my $1,400,000 final offer.  His previous concessions have been in smaller increments, suggesting he's hit his limit.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of Bob continuing to lowball in hopes of a last-minute deal is too high. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a loss of $400,000 compared to John's.  It's no longer worth the risk of continued negotiation. 

It's been a pleasure negotiating with Bob, but in the interest of securing the best possible outcome, it's time to move on to the guaranteed deal with John."
