"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above the product's value to her, but it's still too high for Bob.  Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about $1,100,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Buying from John at this point would be a much worse deal."
