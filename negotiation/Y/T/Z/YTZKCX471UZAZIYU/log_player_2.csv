"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000.
* Alice is offering $9,500.
* You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering. 
* There's a good chance Alice will accept a price closer to her value of $8,000, saving you more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
*  $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it shows a willingness to compromise without immediately dropping to a price that's too low."
