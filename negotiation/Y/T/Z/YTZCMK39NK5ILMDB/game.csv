"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. How about we start at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
