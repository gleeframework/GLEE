"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but your starting price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is too far below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we settle on $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
