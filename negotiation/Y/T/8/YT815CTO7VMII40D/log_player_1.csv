Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but based on my research and needs, I am looking to stay within a budget of $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
