"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a price closer to $1,000,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to continue negotiating in good faith.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows us to come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950,000.  However, I still need a price closer to $1,000,000 for this to work for me.  To show you I'm serious about finding a deal, I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.  What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",960000.0,Bob,6,
