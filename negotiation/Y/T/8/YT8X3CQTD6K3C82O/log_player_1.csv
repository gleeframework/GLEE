Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential benefits for Bob. I'm also leaving the door open for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting high, I'm maximizing potential profit.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer gives me leverage throughout the negotiation. 
* **Encourage negotiation:** By being open to discussion, I'm encouraging Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially secure a better deal.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a price closer to $1,000,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to continue negotiating in good faith.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $1,000,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective, but emphasizing that $900,000 is not acceptable. I'm highlighting the benefits of my counteroffer for both of us and keeping the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to achieving a price closer to my desired range.
* **Finding a middle ground:** My counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that could potentially be agreeable to both of us.
* **Staying open to discussion:** The message encourages Bob to continue negotiating and possibly make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows us to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product for me.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $1,000,000.  This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially secure a better deal.  While selling to John is always an option, I want to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950,000.  However, I still need a price closer to $1,000,000 for this to work for me.  To show you I'm serious about finding a deal, I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $980,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's effort to meet me halfway while emphasizing that I still need a higher price. I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" and expressing my desire to reach an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm willing to budge, I'm not settling for a price far below my desired range. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is truly willing to go higher, or if he's going to stick to his $950,000 offer. 
* **Keeping the negotiation moving:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and avoids a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It seems like we've reached an impasse in the negotiation, and further back-and-forth is unlikely to get us to a price I'm comfortable with.

**Strategy:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price, it's time to move on and avoid potentially wasting more time with Bob. Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price for the product and avoids any further negotiation fatigue."
