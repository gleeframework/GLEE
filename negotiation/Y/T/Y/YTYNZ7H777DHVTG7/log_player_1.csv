Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet halfway. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $8,750.

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I've already gone down significantly from my initial price, and I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting time. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
