"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, which is higher than my minimum price of $100, but still within a reasonable range given that the product is worth $80 to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build a rapport with Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, ensuring the negotiation continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is lower than my minimum price of $100, and I am still confident that I can get a better price.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  

I'm not ready to sell to John yet, because I believe I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's meet in the middle on this!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I'm showing Bob that I'm listening and taking his offer seriously.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my absolute bottom line.  Let's close this deal and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but I'm also making it clear that I'm willing to close the deal at this price.
* **Sense of urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is my ""bottom line"" and encouraging Bob to accept the offer.
* **Positive closing:** I'm ending the message on a positive note, emphasizing the benefits of closing the deal and focusing on a collaborative approach."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $97.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I've made several concessions, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation is not worth it. I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $100, which is my minimum goal."
