"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit low for me, considering my cost. How about $130?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $128? I'm willing to make a deal, but I really want to get the best price I can.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $128 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $129? It's a fair price for both of us.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with $129. I'm willing to go up to $127, that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's meet in the middle at $127.5",127.5,Bob,6,
