"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:**  Starting with a high price sets a strong baseline for negotiation. 
* **Justifying the price:** Mentioning the product's value and potential benefits for Bob helps him see the worth.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $1,200,000 is more than Bob's estimated value, it leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers. 
* **Staying open to John:**  This offer doesn't immediately lock me into a deal with Bob, allowing me to consider John's offer if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I need to make it worthwhile.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I still have 8 rounds left. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, which I can always fall back on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects the value and potential it holds for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  This counteroffer shows I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not desperate to make a deal.
* **Re-emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to maintain leverage.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  Leaving room for another counteroffer keeps the negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is finally above my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Limited time:**  We're only in round 4, and I have 6 rounds remaining. It's worth considering that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away, and I could end up selling to John for $1,000,000 anyway.  

Accepting this offer ensures a profit and minimizes the risk of a stalemate."
