"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than my budget and John's offer.  It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $5,000?"", 
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a low offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This price is significantly lower than her initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving John as Leverage:** I haven't completely revealed my hand. Knowing John will sell for $8,000 gives me a fallback position if Alice is unwilling to negotiate reasonably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  However, she's still closer to her desired price than mine. Since I have the option to buy from John for $8,000, I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? That would make it much easier for me to say yes."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm aiming slightly below my ""walk-away"" price of $8,000 (John's offer). This gives me a bit of bargaining room while still staying within a reasonable range.
* **Emphasizing Budget:** I continue to highlight budget limitations, which might make Alice more willing to negotiate, especially if she believes she might lose the sale. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""make it much easier for me to say yes,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $8,500, and has indicated this is her lowest price. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower.  At this point, John's offer of $8,000 is more appealing. It's not worth the risk of Alice sticking to her price and me missing out on both deals."
