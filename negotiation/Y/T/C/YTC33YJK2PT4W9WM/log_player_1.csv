"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $160 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm offering $170. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $165 is a good profit and it seems like Bob is unlikely to budge much further.  It's better than selling to John and risks further negotiation getting us into a stalemate."
