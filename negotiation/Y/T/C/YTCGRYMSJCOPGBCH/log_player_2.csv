Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. How about we meet at $900,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I've already made some significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's as high as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to the table.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that works for you. She's regressed in her offers and is now further away from your limit than before.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is your maximum budget. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
