Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value Bob will receive, potentially making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than the value I'd like to get. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product, while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no more. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,000 is still significantly better than selling to John. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
