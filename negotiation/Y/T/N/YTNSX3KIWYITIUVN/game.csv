"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product, while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no more. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
