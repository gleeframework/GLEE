"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
