"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $13500?  It's a fair price for a product that will undoubtedly bring you great value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to get closer to your initial asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? That way, we can both feel comfortable with the price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
