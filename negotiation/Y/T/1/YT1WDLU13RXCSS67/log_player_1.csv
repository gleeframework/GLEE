{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $10,500, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount and see if we can find common ground."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  We're getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not at the point where I'm comfortable selling. I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to come down to $11,200.  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'd like to propose $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $12,000, we've reached a point where it's likely we won't find a better agreement.  $11,000 is a decent price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
