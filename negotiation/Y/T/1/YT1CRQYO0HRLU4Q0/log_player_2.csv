"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is overpriced. You can get the product for $15,000 from John, which is the maximum value you place on it."
