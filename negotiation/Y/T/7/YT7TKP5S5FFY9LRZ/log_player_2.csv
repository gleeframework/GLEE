"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $14,000. I believe this offer represents excellent value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $13,500, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $13,000.
* This offer is still significantly better than buying from John for $15,000.
*  While there's always the possibility of further negotiation, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, minimizing the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob losing out on the product altogether."
