"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the profit I can make.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and it's the absolute maximum I can pay at this time.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
