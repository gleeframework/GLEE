"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This price would still be profitable for you and allows me to acquire the product within my means. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and the fact that you would still be making a profit. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
