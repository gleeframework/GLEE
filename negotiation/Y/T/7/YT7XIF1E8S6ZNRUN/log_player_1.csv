"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high, hoping to get a good deal.  Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'm leaving some room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll see how low he's willing to go and then decide if I want to continue negotiating with him or sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $150, but I'll see what happens in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer.  This should give him a better chance of accepting, while still allowing me to get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price in the next round.  While $150 is guaranteed with John, I'm hoping to get closer to that with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again, but only slightly.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price.  This is my last offer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can push him a little further.  If he doesn't come up to at least $150, I'll be happy to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

This is my final attempt to reach a deal with Bob. I'm lowering my price to $140, which is just below my minimum price, but still a good profit. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is close to my minimum price, but it's still not enough.  I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, and it seems like we're not going to reach a deal that satisfies both of us.  Rather than continue to negotiate and risk getting an even lower offer, I'm going to sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
