"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a competitive price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price given the value it provides. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price to make this worthwhile.  How about $900,000?  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $800,000.  How about we meet at $850,000?  That's a good compromise, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment.",850000.0,Alice,5,
