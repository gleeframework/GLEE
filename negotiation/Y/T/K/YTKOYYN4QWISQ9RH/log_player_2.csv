"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first.  $1,100,000 is still too high, and there's a good chance we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge.  We know she values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer is still within her range.  We'll see if she bites."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Since Alice's offer in round 3 is higher than my initial offer in round 2, I'm moving closer to her price, but still below what I consider a reasonable value.  $1,050,000 is a good compromise that leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is now equal to the price John is offering. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice.  It's time to buy from John and close the deal."
