"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is as close as I can get to my target price while still being reasonable. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
