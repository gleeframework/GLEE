Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but going lower increases the chance Bob will accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $140, there might be a chance Bob counter-offers, giving you room to still get closer to your desired price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could offer a lower price initially."
