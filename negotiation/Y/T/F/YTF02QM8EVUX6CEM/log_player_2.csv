"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  There's no information about the value of the product to Alice, so it's possible she's willing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $13,000? I'm really keen on getting this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can see you're serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already come down from $15,000 to $14,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and suggests there might be room for further compromise. However, it's important to note that Alice could reject further counteroffers. 

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John and is a reasonable compromise."
