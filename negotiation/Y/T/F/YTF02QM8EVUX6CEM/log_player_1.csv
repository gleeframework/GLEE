"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $13000? I'm really keen on getting this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($12,000), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.
