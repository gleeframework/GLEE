"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to establish rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $88. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer of $88 is still below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating in the hope of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $87. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer of $87 is still below it. I will reject his offer and keep negotiating with the hope of reaching a more favorable price. I still have several rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible here. How about $89? It's just a small step up from your offer, and we could finally close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $89 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $86. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob is unlikely to go higher than $86. This is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. With only two rounds left, it's more beneficial for me to sell to John for $120 and guarantee a profit."
