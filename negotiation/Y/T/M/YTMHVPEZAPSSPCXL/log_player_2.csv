"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a lower price by counter-offering.  The goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. While John's offer is still an option, Bob should try to exhaust all avenues with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a lower price. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer but still below $10,000. This could potentially lead to a deal where both parties are satisfied."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to Bob's limit.  It's possible that Alice will continue to make small concessions, but the risk is that the negotiation will drag on without a guarantee of a better price.  Since Bob has a clear alternative with John, who is willing to sell for $12,000, it makes sense to secure the product now and avoid further negotiations.  This ensures a quick purchase within Bob's budget."
