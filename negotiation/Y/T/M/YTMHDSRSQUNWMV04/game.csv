"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a good price, it's unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This would still give you a great deal on a product that's worth more to you. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget of $10,000. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price point?",10000.0,Bob,4,
