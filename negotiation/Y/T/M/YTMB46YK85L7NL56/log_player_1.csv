"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point as it's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but still leaves me with a profit. I'm hopeful he'll accept, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle just yet. Bob is clearly willing to pay more, and I have 8 rounds left to get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good profit for me. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in closing the deal at this price, as I'm starting to run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and Bob's offer is only $5 less than what John is offering.  I'm taking the sure thing and selling to Bob for $85."
