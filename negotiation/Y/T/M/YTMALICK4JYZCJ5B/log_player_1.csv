"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. My starting price is $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price to give myself some room to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $70? That feels like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise again.  I'm willing to come down to $75.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $72.50? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, there's a risk that Bob will continue to push for a lower price.  With only four rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a good profit and eliminates the risk of a lower price."
