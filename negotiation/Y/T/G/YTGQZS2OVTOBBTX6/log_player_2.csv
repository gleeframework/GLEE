"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

You are willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is offering it for $8,000.  Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. You should reject the offer and buy from John."
