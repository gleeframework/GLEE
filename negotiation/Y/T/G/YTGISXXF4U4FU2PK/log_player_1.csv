Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer it at $15,000 to John, there's an opportunity to make a higher profit with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it just below John's price ($14,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the price is firm, Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to potentially get closer to $15,000."
