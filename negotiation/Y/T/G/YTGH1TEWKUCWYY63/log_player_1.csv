Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $700,000?  I believe this reflects a fair deal for both of us.
