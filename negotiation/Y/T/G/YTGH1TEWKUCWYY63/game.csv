"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $700,000?  I believe this reflects a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I hope you can see the value in this compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
