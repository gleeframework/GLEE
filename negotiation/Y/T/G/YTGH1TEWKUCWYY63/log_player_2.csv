"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $700,000?  I believe this reflects a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I hope you can see the value in this compromise.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000, and we've already got a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice."
