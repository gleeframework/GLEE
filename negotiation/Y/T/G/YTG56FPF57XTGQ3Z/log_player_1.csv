Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price of $12,000. While I know Bob values the product at $10,000, I'm hoping he'll see the value and be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer and decide if I'm willing to compromise. If not, I'll go with John who is guaranteed to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too far below my minimum value, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering $11,000. This is still a bit above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping this is a good middle ground that will allow us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000.  I've already negotiated and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a higher offer from Bob.  I'm going to go with John and sell the product to him for $12,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired price."
