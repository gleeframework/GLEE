Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like you're being unreasonable.
* **It reflects the product's value to Bob:**  You're acknowledging Bob's potential benefit from owning the product, encouraging him to consider your offer. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer.  Rejecting allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point,  Bob's offer of $12,000 is only $2,000 below your initial offer and only slightly lower than your counteroffer. It's a good deal considering that you could sell to John for $10,000. Accepting ensures you secure a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
