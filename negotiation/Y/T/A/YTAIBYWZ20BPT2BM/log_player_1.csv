"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than the product's value to Bob ($150). There's room to negotiate a higher price, and with 8 rounds left, I can try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a little too low. How about we split the difference at $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $110 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and his offer of $105 is now just $5 below my starting offer.  This is a good deal for me, considering my minimum price is $80, and I'm getting closer to my desired price point.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal than selling to John, so accepting Bob's offer is the best move at this stage."
