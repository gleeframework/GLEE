"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its true worth. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum and significantly less than John's $15,000 offer. It's a good deal for you."
