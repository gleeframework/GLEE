"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $500,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, my product holds significant worth beyond that figure.  How about we meet halfway and consider $1,250,000? This reflects its true value while still offering you a competitive edge.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while remaining within a reasonable price range.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $650,000 offer is still significantly below the product's true market value.  I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as my final offer. This represents a considerable compromise on my end and ensures you're receiving a very competitive deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
