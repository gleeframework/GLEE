"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price. Buying from John at $15,000 is always an option, but let's try to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too Low:** Offering $10,500 is still a reasonable markup from Alice's perceived value of $10,000. It shows we're serious buyers but looking for a fair price. 
* **Polite and Positive:** The message keeps the tone polite and positive, focusing on finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to find a middle ground. How about $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above our target. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate. Let's counter with a price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer ($10,500) and her current offer ($12,500), signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Strategic:** We're still negotiating well below her initial offer and closer to our ideal price range. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes finding a fair deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly interested in the value this product brings. I'm aiming for $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a price we might accept, but we're still not at our ideal point. We've made good progress, and there's no harm in trying to push for a slightly better deal before considering her $12,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can do $11,750, and I think that's a very fair price.  Does that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're making a smaller counteroffer this time ($11,750), signaling that we're getting closer to our limit but still open to negotiation.
* **Justification:**  By stating ""I think that's a very fair price"", we're subtly anchoring our offer as a reasonable compromise.
* **Seeking Closure:** The tone suggests we're aiming to finalize the deal soon, subtly adding a bit of pressure."
