"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $9,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'll accept $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9200.0,Bob,4,
