Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing our minimum is $150 from John.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it at $150 or more is unlikely to work, as Bob only values it at $80. We need a price enticing for Bob but profitable for us.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $120 is a significant markup from Bob's valuation, but it's a price he *might* consider if he sees the product as somewhat desirable.  

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $120. We've weighed the risk of losing him against the potential for higher profit."
