"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I can sell it to you for $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $90.  It's a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $90, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make another small concession, though. I can sell it to you for $92.50. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $91?  I really do want to buy this product from you, but I need to stay within my price range.",91.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $91. I can meet you halfway between $92.50 and $91, which would be $91.75. What do you think?",91.75,Alice,9,
