Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,112,500? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm keen to finalize this deal, $1,095,000 is still a bit below what I need.

Alice seems stuck at $1,100,000. It's unlikely she'll go down to a price that beats John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product for $1,000,000 from John."
