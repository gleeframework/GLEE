Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's a fair price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **It's ambitious:** It aims for a price closer to your desired value of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving you the opportunity to bargain.
* **It's within reason:** $1,150,000 is a price Bob might be willing to pay, especially if he values the product highly. 

By starting high and being prepared to counteroffer, you maximize your chances of getting the best price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,080,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale with John for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but staying above Bob's offer.  It signals my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value. 

Here's why this counteroffer is strategically sound:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It meets Bob halfway, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** Bob might counteroffer again, but the gap is shrinking. 
* **It avoids the guaranteed sale:** It keeps the potential of a better deal alive while also avoiding a hasty decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the time to take the guaranteed sale. While I'd like to get closer to my target price, Bob's counteroffers are getting increasingly lower. Accepting his offer would be below my minimum acceptable value. 

Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price and avoids further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower offer. It's the most logical decision to secure a profitable sale."
