"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and potential. I'm initially offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's room for negotiation. It's likely Alice is willing to come down in price, especially as this is the first round.  Rejecting the offer opens the door for counteroffers and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your interest in working with me. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** A $2,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer demonstrates Bob's serious intent to negotiate while still showing respect for Alice's value.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is friendly but firm, highlighting Bob's willingness to work together.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $12,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. It's a good starting point for finding a price that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers you significant value, and I'm confident it will more than pay for itself. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Alice has moved from $14,000 to $13,000, but Bob can still potentially get a better deal. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving and demonstrates Bob's commitment to finding a price that aligns with his budget.
* **Finding a sweet spot:**  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, and there's a chance he can get closer to his desired $12,000 price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. This offer shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly from $12,000 to $12,500, showing flexibility without significantly compromising his goal.
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial solution,"" appealing to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Closing the Gap:**  $12,500 is closer to Alice's last offer, suggesting a potential end point to the negotiation."
