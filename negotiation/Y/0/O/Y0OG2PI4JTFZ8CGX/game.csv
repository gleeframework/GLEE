"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and potential. I'm initially offering it at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your interest in working with me. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers you significant value, and I'm confident it will more than pay for itself. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. This offer shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution.  Let's close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
