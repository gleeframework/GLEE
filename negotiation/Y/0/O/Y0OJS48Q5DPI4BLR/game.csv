,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $105. This is the best I can do, and I'm sure you'll find it's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,5,
