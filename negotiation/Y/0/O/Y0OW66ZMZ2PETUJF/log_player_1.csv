Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's interested, getting you closer to your maximum potential profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the message focuses on potential value rather than just the price. This could entice Bob to consider it if he sees additional value not initially factored in.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob rejects the offer at $140. However, this strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings before resorting to your guaranteed sale with John."
