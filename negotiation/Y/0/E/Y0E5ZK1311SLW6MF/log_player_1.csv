Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still potentially attractive compared to losing the deal. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. There's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer, and you'll be left selling to John at your minimum acceptable price. However, the potential for a higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
