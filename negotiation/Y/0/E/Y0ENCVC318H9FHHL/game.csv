"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,,
