Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $12,500 is a bit closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows him to see if he can get Alice closer to his ideal price."
