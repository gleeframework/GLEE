Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects a significant discount and represents a great deal for you. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,325,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still a good deal. It's a significant profit for me, and further negotiation might risk losing him as a buyer altogether."
