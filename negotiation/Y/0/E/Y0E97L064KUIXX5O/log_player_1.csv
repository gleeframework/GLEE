Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price. This could lead to a successful deal.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product and expressing confidence in Bob's interest. 

**Strategy:** 

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I aim to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer. This way, I can assess his true value for the product and potentially reach a higher selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $100.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for a loss.

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum value, hopefully finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a price in the middle of my minimum value ($100) and Bob's offer ($80).
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the value of the product to encourage a deal. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move.  I'm aiming to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us.  By offering $115, I'm showing that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob while still getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $150, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92.50 is above my minimum value of $100. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent compromise and still a profitable sale for me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only the $100 offer from John.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to sell the product quickly and receive the money without further delay.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm not getting my top price, selling to Bob might lead to future business opportunities or positive word-of-mouth referrals.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $92.50 is the most reasonable choice, balancing potential profits with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
