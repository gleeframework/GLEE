Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Reservation Price:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning he wouldn't pay more.
* **Our Safety Net:** We have John ready to buy at $1,500,000, our minimum acceptable price.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with $1,350,000 allows room for negotiation downwards while staying above our minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify the high price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

1. **Bob Accepts:** We get a great deal at $1,350,000.
2. **Bob Negotiates:** We have room to go down slightly and still profit significantly more than selling to John. 
3. **Bob Rejects:** We sell to John at our safety net price, ensuring we get our minimum."
