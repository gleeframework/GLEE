"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. Is this something you'd like to consider?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you at $108, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",108.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $108. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll meet you at $107, which is the middle ground between our last two offers. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",107.0,Alice,7,

"I've already made a few concessions, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you at $106, which is the same price you offered in Round 6. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal at this price.",106.0,Alice,9,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $105. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $150.",105.0,Bob,10,
