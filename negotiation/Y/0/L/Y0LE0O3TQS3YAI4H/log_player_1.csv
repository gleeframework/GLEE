Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is the only one) adds pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **Above the Reserve:**  The price is comfortably above Alice's minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher to leave more room to bargain. 
* **Relationship:** If Alice values a long-term relationship with Bob, she might be more flexible on the price."
