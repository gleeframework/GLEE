"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit of a stretch for me. Can you meet me at that price or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $11,000?  This would still be a good price for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $8,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell the product for anything less than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet. I'm willing to be flexible but $8,500 simply doesn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
