Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $11,000?  This would still be a good price for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet. I'm willing to be flexible but $8,500 simply doesn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.
