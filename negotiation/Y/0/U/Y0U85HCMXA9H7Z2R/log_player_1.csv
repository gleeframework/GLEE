Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial offer is above Bob's value:** $135 is higher than Bob's value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaves room for counteroffer:** This allows for a potential negotiation to reach a price that benefits both parties.
* **Not too high:**  $135 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150, so I can afford to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting high, I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  The initial offer allows me to adjust based on Bob's response and counteroffers.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  I have John as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $135 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum value of $150, and even lower than my initial offer of $135.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he is interested. Rejecting it allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a better price.
* **John remains an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail again, I can still sell the product to John for $150.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain a higher price point:**  I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired value.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  This shows Bob that I am open to reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* **Avoid settling for a low price:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss compared to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $120? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. "", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's value:** $120 is still a bit higher than Bob's stated value of $120, but it's a significant reduction from my previous offer and shows flexibility.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:**  This maintains the momentum of the negotiation and prevents it from stalling.
* **Maintains profit margin:**  $120 is still above my minimum value of $150, so I'm still making a profit.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a compromise:** It attempts to find a price point that is acceptable to both parties.
* **Signal a willingness to negotiate:**  It shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Avoid selling too low:**  It prevents me from settling for a price that is significantly lower than my desired value."
