"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit far from breaking even. I'm willing to go a bit higher and sell it to you for $105. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
