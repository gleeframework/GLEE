"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I have to consider my budget. Can you meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is no less than $10000.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $11200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $10800 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $10800 and my original price of $12000.
