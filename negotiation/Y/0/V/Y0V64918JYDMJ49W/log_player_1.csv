Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is still attractive to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's true value to me emphasizes the potential for a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage and counter. 

This approach balances the need to maximize my profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. It sets a clear starting point and leaves room for negotiation while reminding Bob of the value he'd be getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $950000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While he is interested, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as he acknowledges the product's value and is willing to engage. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed profit. However, a counteroffer could potentially yield a higher price, which would be more beneficial.

Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $950,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value again:** Emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product reinforces its worth and justifies the price.
* **Reiterating fairness:** The message emphasizes that this counteroffer is still a ""fair deal"" for both parties, making it more appealing. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that both parties can agree on. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $990000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While Bob's offer of $990,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further negotiation could lead to even lower offers, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 provides a guaranteed profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation. 

Therefore, selling to John is the most rational choice, as it minimizes risk and ensures a higher profit than Bob's current offer."
