"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but not all the way to $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This reflects the product's true value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $1,025,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll propose $1,012,500. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1012500.0,Bob,4,
