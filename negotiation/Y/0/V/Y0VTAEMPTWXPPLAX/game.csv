"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Considering its exceptional value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 undervalues its potential. I could consider coming down to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. ",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product has significant value, but $2,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to try and find a agreeable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,950,000.  This is a significant reduction from my original ask and reflects my desire to make this deal work. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer given the value this product brings.
