"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $900,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $850,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I still think $850,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",800000.0,Bob,4,
