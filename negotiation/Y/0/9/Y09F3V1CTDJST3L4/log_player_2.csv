"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1,200,000.  It's a rare find, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John.  Rejecting the offer keeps your options open."
