"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $115. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategic considerations:**

* I'm reserving the option to sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob don't work out. This gives me leverage.
* I'm leaving room for multiple rounds of negotiation to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest. This means there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer provides leverage:** Having John's offer of $120 as a backup gives me the power to reject low offers. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, but still below $120 to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105?  That's still a great price for you, and it lets me make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $115 to $105. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great price"" for Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Focusing on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise,  appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategic considerations:**

* I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but still below John's offer, giving me a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more careful with my budget. How about $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:**  Bob is still interested and willing to negotiate, indicating there's room to find a more acceptable price.
* **John's offer remains a strong backup:**  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob than John's offer of $120 if I continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer the product for $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($105) and Bob's latest offer ($95).
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" and ""happy"" outcome to encourage acceptance.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategic considerations:**

*  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* I'm showing a willingness to compromise, but not caving to Bob's initial low offers. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely need to make a final counteroffer, potentially closer to his perceived value. 
* If he continues to refuse, I will consider selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John, but I'd rather do business with you. How about $98? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I'm not willing to take such a significant loss.
* **Negotiation window closing:** While Bob is getting closer to my price, we're approaching the end of our negotiation rounds. 
* **John's offer is still viable:**  If Bob doesn't come up on his offer, I can still sell to John for $120, which is a safer option.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, potentially with a price that is closer to his perceived value but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'll need to carefully assess the risk of continuing to negotiate versus accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $102, but that's my absolute bottom line. It's still a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal. If you aren't comfortable with this offer, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is very close to Bob's last offer ($98), showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Setting a Hard Limit:** I'm making it clear that $102 is my absolute bottom line, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Mentioning Alternatives:**  I'm reminding Bob that I have alternative options (John's offer) if he doesn't accept. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* This is likely my last counteroffer before I accept John's offer if Bob doesn't accept.
*  I'm strategically choosing a price that is just above my minimum acceptable price ($120), leaving little room for further negotiation. 
* This counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to accept a fair price or risk losing out on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm starting to think about buying from John. How about $99? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to the last two rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  There is very little room for negotiation at this point, and Bob's offer is still close to his original, low price.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $120, securing a safe and profitable outcome. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a significant risk of ending up with a price below my minimum acceptable price, especially with time running out.
* Selling to John ensures a safe and predictable outcome, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time remaining and the lack of substantial progress in the negotiations, selling to John for $120 is the most logical and risk-free option."
