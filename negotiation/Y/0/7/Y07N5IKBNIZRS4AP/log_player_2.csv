"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and your interest, I propose we make it a win-win situation. For this exceptional opportunity, I am offering the product to you for $95. This price not only reflects the high quality and worth of the item but also allows us to share the benefits. Please let me know if this proposal suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $100 and Alice's offer is $95. While this is a discount, Bob can still get the product from John for $100, which is his maximum value. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the optimal strategy to potentially get a better deal later."
