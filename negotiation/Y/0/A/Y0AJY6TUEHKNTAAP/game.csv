"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product. However, I am only able to commit to a budget of $12000 for this purchase. Would you consider adjusting the price to meet my budget?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000, as that's my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $14000. I would like to propose a price of $13000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $13500 for the product.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $13250 is a fair price for this exceptional product.

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. I'm willing to make one final compromise, and I'm thinking of a price of $14000.
