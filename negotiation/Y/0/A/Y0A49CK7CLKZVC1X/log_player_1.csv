Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high.  A starting price of $1,200,000 gives you significant room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial price will reveal how interested he truly is and provide insight into his perceived value. 
* **Potential for Maximum Profit:**  There's a chance Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, especially if it's unique or in high demand. 

**Important:**  Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects the initial offer, be ready to lower the price strategically. Remember, your goal is to maximize profit, but securing the sale is also crucial."
