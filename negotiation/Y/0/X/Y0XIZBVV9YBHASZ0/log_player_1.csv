"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. My starting price is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good middle ground between my minimum price ($80) and what the product is worth to Bob ($120).
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and creating a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and initiate a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer. I think $85 would be a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $85 is close to my minimum of $80, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Selling to John immediately for $80 would be a guaranteed profit, but I'm not desperate. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more on this product. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:** $92.50 is a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's offer. It's a fair price considering Bob's value for the product.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing the possibility of closing the deal.
* **Showing willingness to compromise:** Offering a midpoint shows that I'm open to negotiation but also not willing to accept a drastically low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product to me, $90 seems like a reasonable price. I hope you can work with this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $90 is just $10 away from my ideal price and is a good compromise.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer from Bob, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge much more.
* **Time pressure:** We are already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal with Bob.

While selling to John for $80 is guaranteed, I believe $90 from Bob is a better deal, considering the value the product holds for him. Accepting his offer is the best choice in this situation."
