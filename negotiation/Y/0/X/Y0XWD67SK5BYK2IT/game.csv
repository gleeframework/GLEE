"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being flexible. However, I'm really only looking to spend around $85 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's fair for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still feeling a bit high at $90.  How about $87?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
