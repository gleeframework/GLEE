Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $6,000 is below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this offer?

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her last offer. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
