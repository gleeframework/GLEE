"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $6,000 is below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you consider $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're a serious buyer, but $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $14,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",14000.0,Alice,5,
