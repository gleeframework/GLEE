"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your price point. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $8,500?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the true value of the product. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $7,250? I think that's a fair price for the product.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,000. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,6,
