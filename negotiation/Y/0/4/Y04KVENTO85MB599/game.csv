"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a little high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $11,500.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal for you too.  Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer of $11,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $12,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12800.0,Alice,5,
