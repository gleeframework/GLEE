Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in.  It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, so he has incentive to negotiate and you can potentially get a better price. 
* **It's a clear offer:** The message is straightforward and the price is stated explicitly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is lower than the initial offer of $100, it's still above your minimum of $80 and secures a sale. It's a good idea to accept Bob's offer, as continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. There's no guarantee that a counteroffer will be successful, and you'd be stuck with the lower price from John."
