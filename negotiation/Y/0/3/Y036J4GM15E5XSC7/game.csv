,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1200000, which is my minimum price, or I can meet you halfway at $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go below $1300000, Bob. I think this product is worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make one final concession. I can do $1280000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've made several concessions, and I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's it. I can do $1250000, which is still below my minimum price, but I'm getting close to my limit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,9,
