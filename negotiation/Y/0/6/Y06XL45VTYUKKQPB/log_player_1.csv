Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I can purchase a similar product from John for that amount. Let me know if you're open to that.
