"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is well over $12000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I can purchase a similar product from John for that amount. Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit high for me.  Considering my budget and the fact that I can get a similar product from John for $10000, I'm only willing to go up to $11000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $11000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is still a good deal, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
