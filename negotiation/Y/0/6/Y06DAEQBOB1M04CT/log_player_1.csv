Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but it gives me room to negotiate. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I have some leverage.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can see if he's willing to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit.  It's a good middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, and it's closer to my initial goal than John's offer.  It's not ideal, but it's a reasonable compromise."
