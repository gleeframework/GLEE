"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $18,000.  Bob knows the product is worth $15,000 to him, so this gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me a profit.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I want to see if I can get him to bite first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is still above my minimum, and I'm hoping that Bob will see it as a compromise.  Since he's already shown he's willing to negotiate, I'm optimistic we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is even lower than his previous offer and is far below my minimum.  I'm still hoping to get a better price, and it seems like Bob is getting more stubborn.  I'm not willing to sell at such a loss, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $15,000.  Bob has been lowballing me, so I'm not going to budge further. If he's serious about buying the product, this is the price. If he rejects, I'm prepared to go to John and sell it for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is very close to my minimum of $15,000. It's a good deal considering how the negotiation has gone. I'm willing to accept it and close the deal. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and risking losing a potential buyer in the future."
