"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got a lot of interest in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $130. If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. Otherwise, I might have to look at other options.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $160 to $130, which is $145. Is that something you'd be interested in?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price again, but $145 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's my absolute limit.  If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
