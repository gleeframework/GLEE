"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $9,800 is still a little too low for me.  However, I'm willing to go down to $11,200. This would give you a great deal on a fantastic product, and it would be closer to the value of what I'm offering.  Let me know what you think.",11200.0,Alice,5,
