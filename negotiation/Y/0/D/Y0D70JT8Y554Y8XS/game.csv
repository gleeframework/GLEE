"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand this product is valuable, however your initial price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to offer $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $650,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'd like to counteroffer at $750,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on. While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while acknowledging the value it holds for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'd like to counteroffer at $725,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll get from the product, and it's closer to the original value you mentioned. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to acquiring the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with $710,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'd like to counteroffer at $720,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll get from the product, and it's a small increase from your last offer. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,7,
