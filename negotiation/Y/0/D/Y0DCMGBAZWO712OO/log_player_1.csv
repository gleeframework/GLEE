Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only able to pay up to $1400000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. $1,400,000 is still below my minimum threshold, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price, especially with a few rounds left. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,437,500. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1437500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate the effort to find common ground. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a final offer of $1430000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  Although it's still below my ideal price, I've been unable to push him higher.  With only a few rounds left, and the risk of having to sell to John for $1,200,000, it's better to secure this deal."
