"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
