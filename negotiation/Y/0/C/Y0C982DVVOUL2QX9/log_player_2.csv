"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows for further bargaining and potentially getting closer to Bob's desired price point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to you is undeniably high. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still a gap between her price and Bob's target.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his goal.  There's still a possibility of getting a better deal from Alice without having to resort to buying from John."
