"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is quite low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you the product for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $12,000 is still above your ideal price and her offer suggests there's room for further negotiation. It's worth seeing if she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $12,000 is still a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $11,000, and even though it's just $1,000 more than your target, you have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate if you're willing to accept John's offer."
