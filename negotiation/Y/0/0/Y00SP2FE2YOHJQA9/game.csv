"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is quite low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you the product for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $12,000 is still a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
