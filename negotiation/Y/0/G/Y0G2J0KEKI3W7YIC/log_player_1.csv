{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my value of $1,500,000, but still attractive to Bob considering his value of $800,000.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for my full value if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, I am only willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to move towards this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am still not comfortable with $1,050,000. Could we perhaps aim for $1,000,000? This would be a significant improvement from my previous offer and closer to what you're asking. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,000,000 is still a far cry from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer one more time and see if we can reach a compromise. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John and secure my full value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to go with another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see, Alice. While I respect your final offer, I believe I can secure the product elsewhere for a lower price. Thank you for considering my offers. I will proceed to purchase the product from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'm not getting my ideal price, I'm still securing a good amount for the product and avoiding a prolonged negotiation that might lead to an even lower offer."
