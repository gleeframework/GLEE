Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a high but reasonable offer allows room for negotiation while aiming to secure the maximum possible profit.
* **Understanding Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's a potential $150,000 profit margin to explore.
* **Alternative Option:** We have a safety net with John at $1,000,000, ensuring we won't settle for less than our minimum. 
* **Negotiation Starter:** The initial offer is a starting point, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer and find a mutually agreeable price."
