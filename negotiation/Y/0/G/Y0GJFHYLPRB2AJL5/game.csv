"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $7,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",7250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $7,100? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",7100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,100, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $7,300. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7300.0,Alice,5,
