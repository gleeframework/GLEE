"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  There's a good chance she's willing to lower her price, especially since you have a clear alternative (John) willing to sell at a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a clear signal to Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but have a strict limit.  It's unlikely she'll accept this offer immediately, but it sets the stage for a negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating. I believe there's still room for a compromise, especially considering John's offer is significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial $1,000,000 to show I'm serious about buying the product.  However, I'm still significantly lower than Alice's price, giving us room to negotiate.  This should show Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway but also have my limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price has come down, it's still above my desired price point. There's a good chance we can reach an agreement closer to my maximum budget.  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but still staying within my budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal but have a hard limit. I'm hoping this will be the final offer needed to reach an agreement. If she rejects, I'll likely move to John's offer as there's not much room left for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than my preferred range.  At this point,  I've made several counteroffers, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower.  I've reached my limit for negotiation and don't want to risk further rounds. John's offer is significantly lower than Alice's current price, making it the more financially sensible choice."
