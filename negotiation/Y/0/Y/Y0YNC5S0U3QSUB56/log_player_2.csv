"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's valued at $120 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $115 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much wiggle room there is. This leaves us space to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $105?  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not in our ideal price range. Let's counter again and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $90 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $97?"", 
""product_price"": 97
}
```

We're edging closer to $100, but still trying to keep the price under $100 if possible. This counter-offer shows Alice we are willing to negotiate but also holding our ground on getting a good deal."
