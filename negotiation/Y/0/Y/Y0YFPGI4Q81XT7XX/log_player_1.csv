Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $1,000,000. I'm very interested in this product, but I need to make sure the price works for my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
