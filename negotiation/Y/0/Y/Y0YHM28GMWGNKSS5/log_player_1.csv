Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're getting more than your $8,000 minimum.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation, as Bob sees the product as worth $12,000.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation that could lead to a mutually beneficial price.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you create an opportunity for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still ensuring you profit from the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, rejecting it and making a counteroffer is a better strategy. Here's why:

* **Room for negotiation:** Bob has shown he's willing to pay more than your minimum. By rejecting his offer, you can push for a higher price.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  A counteroffer could lead to a compromise closer to your desired $10,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Accepting Bob's offer immediately might make him think you're desperate to sell, limiting your negotiating power. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially achieve a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a midpoint between your previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows you're willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While lower than your initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's, indicating that you're not desperate to sell.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and focuses on finding a fair price, further encouraging Bob to accept. 

By making a counteroffer at $9,250, you continue to pursue a higher price while keeping the negotiation amicable and moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer.  How about $8,900? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $10,000 goal,  Bob's offer of $8,900 is a good deal for several reasons:

* **It's above my minimum:**  This ensures I'm making a profit and exceeding my $8,000 minimum.
* **It's close to a compromise:**  This offer is only $100 less than my last counteroffer. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower offer, or a stalemate. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
