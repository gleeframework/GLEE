Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $650,000 is significantly below what I need to sell it.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a very profitable investment for you.  Let's find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  However, $725,000 is still quite a bit lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm prepared to go down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you coming down, but $850,000 is still a stretch for me. I could potentially go up to $750,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting a sense that we may be at an impasse. While I'm willing to work with you, $750,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm going to make one final offer at $800,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other buyers.  Let me know your final decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has come down to your maximum price. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and it's not worth risking losing the deal at this point."
