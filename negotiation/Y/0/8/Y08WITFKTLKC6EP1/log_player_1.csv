"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a deal, I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $650,000 is significantly below what I need to sell it.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a very profitable investment for you.  Let's find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  While $950,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for something around $725,000.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product. I'm open to continued negotiation, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my goal, $725,000 is still too low. I need to see if I can push for a higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  However, $725,000 is still quite a bit lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm prepared to go down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you coming down, but $850,000 is still a stretch for me. I could potentially go up to $750,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I appreciate Bob's increased offer, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to make one final counteroffer in the next round before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a sense that we may be at an impasse. While I'm willing to work with you, $750,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm going to make one final offer at $800,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other buyers.  Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 800000}
