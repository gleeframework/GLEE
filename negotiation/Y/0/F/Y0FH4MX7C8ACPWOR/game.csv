"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's exceptional value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $2000000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about staying within your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1750000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $800000.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
