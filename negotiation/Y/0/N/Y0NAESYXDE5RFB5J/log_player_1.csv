"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $175 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm countering with $190. This is a compromise, showing flexibility but still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $180 is a good price, and while I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm happy to sell to Bob at this price."
