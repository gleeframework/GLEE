"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price.  I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate with Bob, I can get closer to my desired price point of $10,000.  I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $9,100 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,100.  While it's still below my ideal price, I'm running out of rounds and I'm not confident I can get much higher.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good deal and don't risk ending up with nothing if I continue to negotiate and Bob decides to walk away."
