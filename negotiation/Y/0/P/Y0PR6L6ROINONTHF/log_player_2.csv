It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can try to get Alice down from $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than the $7,500 you're hoping for. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
