"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $7500 for this product. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8500. This is a good compromise for both of us and would allow me to finalize the purchase. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,4,
