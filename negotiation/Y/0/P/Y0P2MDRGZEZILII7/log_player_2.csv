This product is far outside my budget. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to start with a significant counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and hopefully will show her that I'm serious about a deal, but I'm also not going to overpay."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to try to negotiate further.  I want to see if I can get her closer to my initial counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $1,250,000. This is still a considerable discount from Alice's latest offer and closer to my maximum budget. It shows willingness to negotiate while also making it clear that I'm not going to go much higher."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
