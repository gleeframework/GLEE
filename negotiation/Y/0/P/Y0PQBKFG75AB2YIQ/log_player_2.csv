# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $12,000 to you. Considering our costs and the market value, I propose a price of $10,000 for this exceptional product. This is an opportunity to secure a top-tier solution at a price that is still profitable for us while providing significant value to you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or making a purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($10,000 < $12,000).**
* **You save money compared to buying from John ($12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000 saved).**

Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($10,000 > $8,000), it's still a good deal for you because you save money and get the product you want."
