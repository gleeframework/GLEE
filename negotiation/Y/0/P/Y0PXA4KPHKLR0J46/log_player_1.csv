"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That leaves us both with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 140}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm still not willing to sell at this price. I believe I can push for a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm confident I can reach a deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Would you be willing to consider $135?  That's a good compromise that lets us both come away happy."", ""product_price"": 135}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $132 is very close to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at this price.  I believe I can still push for a bit higher, especially with the time pressure now starting to build."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $134.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 134}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are running out of time, and there is no guarantee Bob will budge further. While $131 is close to my minimum, it's still below my target. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation risk."
