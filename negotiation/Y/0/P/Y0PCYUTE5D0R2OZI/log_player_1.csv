"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows for room to negotiate. It's also a strong starting point, showing I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,050,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, while still getting a price closer to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to settle. I'm going to keep negotiating, and see if I can get closer to my goal. I'm still hopeful that I can secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer but still represents a gain for Bob. I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency for Bob,  and hopefully, he will accept this offer before I lose my patience and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. While $900,000 is tempting, it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions, and the negotiation doesn't seem to be moving in my favor.  It's time to secure the higher price offered by John, ensuring I maximize my profits."
