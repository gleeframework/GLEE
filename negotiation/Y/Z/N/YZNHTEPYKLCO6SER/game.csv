"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $1100000, which is the closest I can get to your desired price. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. Let me know if you're interested!",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. This is my final offer.",980000.0,Bob,6,
