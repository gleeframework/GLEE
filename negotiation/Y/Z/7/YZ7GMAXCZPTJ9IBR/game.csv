"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That gives us both a fair price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $10,000.  Would you consider $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a good deal, and I respect that. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $10,875.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10875.0,Alice,5,
