Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and the high demand, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get the highest price possible. Starting with an offer above Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price. 
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, aiming to justify the high price and potentially lead Bob to accept without further negotiation.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a higher profit often outweighs the risk of going straight to the backup buyer."
