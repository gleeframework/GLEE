"Bob, I understand your need for a competitive price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I believe this product is worth, but I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my original asking price and reflects our ongoing negotiation.  I believe this offer represents a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
