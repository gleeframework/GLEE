"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm confident this product offers significant strategic advantages that justify a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer reflects the true worth of what I'm bringing to the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the strategic advantages, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,550,000.
