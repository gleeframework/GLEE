Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $980,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price well below what you know the product is worth to him. John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees your minimum acceptable profit and avoids further risky negotiations with Bob."
