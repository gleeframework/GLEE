"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. This exceptional item is valued at $12000 to us, reflecting its high quality and unique features. Considering its worth and the benefits it offers, I am extending this opportunity to purchase it for $10000. I believe this price not only represents a fair deal but also allows for some flexibility in negotiations. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations or if you would like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is already at your maximum price point of $10,000. There's no benefit to rejecting the offer and potentially entering a negotiation where the price could go up.  Buying from Alice at this price saves time and effort compared to negotiating further or buying from John."
