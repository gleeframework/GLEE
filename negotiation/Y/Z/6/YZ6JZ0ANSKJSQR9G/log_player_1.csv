Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential of the product,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects a fair value for the product while still allowing me a reasonable profit margin. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000. This price represents a fair value for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal.  Let's close this deal at this price and avoid any further delays.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to budge beyond $950,000. It's clear he's set a firm limit. While another round or two *might* get us a slightly higher price, it's not worth risking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
