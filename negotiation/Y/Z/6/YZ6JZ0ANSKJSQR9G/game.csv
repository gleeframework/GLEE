"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential of the product,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects a fair value for the product while still allowing me a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 represents the high end of its value, $850,000 undervalues its potential.  Let's find a middle ground: how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price allows you a profit and gives me a fair deal. It's a win-win situation. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, which is why I want to see us reach an agreement. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise that considers both our positions.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000. This price represents a fair value for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal.  Let's close this deal at this price and avoid any further delays.",950000.0,Bob,6,
