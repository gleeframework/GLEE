"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget of $800,000.  It's important to start negotiating to try to get a better price.  You can always go with John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential of the product,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects a fair value for the product while still allowing me a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing that you are serious about negotiating.  $850,000 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's much higher than her minimum of $1,000,000. This price also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 represents the high end of its value, $850,000 undervalues its potential.  Let's find a middle ground: how about $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to your budget, you're still aiming to save as much money as possible.  You have several rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price allows you a profit and gives me a fair deal. It's a win-win situation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant compromise from your previous offer, showing Alice that you are willing to move closer to her position.  $950,000 is still a good deal for you, as it's below your maximum budget. It also leaves room for negotiation if Alice is still unwilling to go lower.  This keeps the negotiations moving forward while maintaining your goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, which is why I want to see us reach an agreement. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise that considers both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have 5 rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth pushing for a better price.  You can also always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000. This price represents a fair value for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal.  Let's close this deal at this price and avoid any further delays."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer reiterates your previous offer, demonstrating your commitment to that price. It also emphasizes the benefits of closing the deal quickly, hoping to pressure Alice into accepting.  If this doesn't work, you can always try a slightly higher offer in the next round, but you're getting close to your maximum budget."
