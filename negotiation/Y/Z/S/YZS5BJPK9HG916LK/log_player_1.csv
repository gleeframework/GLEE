{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price closer to the product's value to Bob.  It's also above the value I would get from John, giving me incentive to continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $1,100,000 just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,080,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,100,000 and see if we can find common ground."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk a further negotiation at this point.  The price is too close to John's offer, and I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure the sale to John and guarantee a profit."
