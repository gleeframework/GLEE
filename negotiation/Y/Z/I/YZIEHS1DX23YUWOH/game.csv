"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on this item, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your candor, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional item. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand you need to make a profit, $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
