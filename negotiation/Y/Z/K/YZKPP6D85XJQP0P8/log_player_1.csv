Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I still feel that $950,000 would be a fair price given my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob has been insistent on his $950,000 offer, which is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rounds leading to an even lower offer is high.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000."
