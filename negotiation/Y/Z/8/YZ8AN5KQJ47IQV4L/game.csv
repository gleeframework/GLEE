"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $1,200,000 to you, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to make a slightly lower purchase.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In light of this, I would like to offer a compromise at $1,075,000. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable margin while reflecting the value you place on the product. I look forward to your consideration.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
