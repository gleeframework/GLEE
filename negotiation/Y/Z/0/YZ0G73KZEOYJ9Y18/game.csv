"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your efforts to find a solution.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000.
