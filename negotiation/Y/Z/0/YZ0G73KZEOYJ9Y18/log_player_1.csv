Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a good value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there yet on the price. How about $1,075,000? This is a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,075,000 is getting closer, I still believe I can get a better price. We're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your efforts to find a solution.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000.
