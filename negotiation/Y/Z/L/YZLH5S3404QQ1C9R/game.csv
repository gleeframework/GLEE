"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $85?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is too low, Alice. How about $70?  That's a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $70 is still a bit low.  Let's go with $75.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",75.0,Alice,5,
