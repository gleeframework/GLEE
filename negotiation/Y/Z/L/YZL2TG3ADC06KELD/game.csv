"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.

If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
