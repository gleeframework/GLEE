Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price seems quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I believe the product has value, $1,200,000 is too high for me. I can offer $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

We're making progress, but $700,000 is still too far from my minimum. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we can reach a deal here. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Threshold:** I'm offering the product at my absolute minimum price. This puts the decision firmly in Bob's court.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating it's my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency, which might encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm still holding the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no risk in making this strong stance."
