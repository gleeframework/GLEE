"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you working with me.  I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately I can't go over $11,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is just too low for me. How about $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still below what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to another seller. ",11500.0,Bob,4,
