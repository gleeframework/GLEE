"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $180. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it!"", ""product_price"": 180} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing enthusiasm to make the offer seem appealing.
* **Value proposition:** I'm suggesting the product is a ""great deal"" to highlight potential value to Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* Gauge Bob's initial interest and potential budget.
* Set a high anchor for subsequent negotiations. 
*  Prepare for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, it's still too low to be ideal. I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.**  
* **Keep the negotiation open to potentially secure a better deal.**

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $150. This still gives you a great value, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still aiming for a profit.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving Bob a reason to accept by highlighting the value he's getting at this price.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm inviting further negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts, leaving the door open for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Hold:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still below my ideal price point.
* **Time is Money:** I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell immediately. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I want to keep the negotiation going to try and bridge the gap.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal in the next round. While I could sell to John for $120, I want to see if I can secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  I'm willing to come down to $140. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that the price is ""fair for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of a win-win.
* **Urgency:**  I add a sense of urgency by suggesting ""Let's make this happen!"" to encourage Bob to accept.

By reducing my price slightly and highlighting the mutual benefit, I aim to make my offer more appealing to Bob and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $5 above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming more risky to keep negotiating.
* **Potential Loss:** There's a chance Bob could lower his offer further or walk away entirely. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit. The risk of further negotiation is too high given the limited time and potential for a worse outcome."
