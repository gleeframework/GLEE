"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
