"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price that's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't leave too much money on the table.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm framing the offer as fair to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is above my minimum of $800,000, but it's significantly lower than what I want to achieve.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for a better deal. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially bridge the gap.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting Bob's offer helps me understand his seriousness and willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Stance:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a move toward agreement.
* **Value-Based Justification:** I'm using the value he places on the product as a justification for my price, which might appeal to his logic.
* **Strategic Reduction:**  I'm lowering my price by a significant amount, but it's still above my minimum, keeping the deal potentially profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a better solution. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on My Goal:** Bob's offer is now very close to my initial desired price of $1,200,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only six rounds left, I need to be cautious about rejecting offers and risking running out of time.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or become less willing to compromise. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit while minimizing the chance of losing the deal altogether."
