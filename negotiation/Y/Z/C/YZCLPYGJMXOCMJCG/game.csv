"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",800000.0,Alice,3,
