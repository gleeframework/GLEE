Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you're still making a profit and protects your minimum value.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially get closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $100?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired value. You've already made a concession by coming down from $110 to $100.  Rejecting this offer allows you to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $98.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable going above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offers have consistently been below your minimum acceptable price.  While you could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly likely that you won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's more efficient and profitable to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring you reach your minimum value and avoid further negotiation."
