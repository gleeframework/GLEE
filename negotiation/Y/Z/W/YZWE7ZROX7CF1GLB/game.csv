"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the best price I can offer. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus that's worth $5 to sweeten the deal. If you're willing to meet me at $105, I'll include this bonus. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,5,
