Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential $500,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his perceived value) while maximizing your profit (staying above your minimum).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **Attractive to Bob:**  It's significantly below his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Profitable for You:**  It nets you a $200,000 gain compared to your guaranteed sale.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob tries to haggle, you have some buffer to potentially meet in the middle. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could start higher and be prepared to negotiate down.  Understanding Bob's negotiation style and priorities would refine your approach."
