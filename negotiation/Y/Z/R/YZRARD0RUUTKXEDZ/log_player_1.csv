Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $600000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $700000, which is still a significant amount for me, but closer to my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
