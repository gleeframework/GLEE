"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to you ($800,000).  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $600,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which is still a significant amount for me, but closer to my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $750000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $750,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant discount from her original price and closer to your desired price range.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $800,000 is high. Accepting the offer guarantees you the product at a good price."
