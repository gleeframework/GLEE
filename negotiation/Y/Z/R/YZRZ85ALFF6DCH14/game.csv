"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me and I'm sure we can both find a deal we're happy with.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $10,500. This is a fair price given its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for you too. ",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're getting closer to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $12,000, so I'll offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know now.",11250.0,Alice,5,
