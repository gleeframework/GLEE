"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay, considering the product's value to him. This allows room for potential negotiation and increases the chances of a successful deal while ensuring I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a better price. $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, but it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $1,750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm still aiming for $1,700,000. This price reflects the product's quality and potential value to you.  I'm open to discussing further, but I'm confident this is a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I've lowered my offer slightly to show some flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This keeps the pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price while maintaining a good chance of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1600000. How about we meet in the middle at $1650000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for improvement.  I'm confident I can push for a price closer to $1,700,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,675,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. I'm committed to reaching an agreement, but I need to ensure I receive a reasonable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1675000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but still maintaining a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while pushing for a better price.  It's also a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1650000. How about we meet at $1660000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,660,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,660,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,660,000 is not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Given the risk of Bob rejecting my next offer or me not being able to close the deal within the remaining rounds, it's a good strategy to accept this offer."
