Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), you can afford to start with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $11,500 offer allows for potential negotiation. Bob might try to counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to go lower or stick closer to your $10,000 minimum. 
* **Justifying the Price:** Mentioning the ""value"" of the product subtly suggests it's worth more than what Bob might think. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
