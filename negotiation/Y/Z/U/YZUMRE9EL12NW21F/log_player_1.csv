Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1700000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit low. I'll try to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1150000 is still a bit above my budget. However, I'm willing to pay $1125000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while remaining within my budget. Let's reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price,  $1,125,000 is a good deal considering the risk of Bob walking away or me selling to John for a lower price."
