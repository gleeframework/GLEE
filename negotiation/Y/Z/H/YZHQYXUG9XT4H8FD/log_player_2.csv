"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to us, but I understand its value might be different for you. Considering its quality and benefits, I'd like to propose a price of $95 for you to experience all it has to offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, we need to maintain the value of our product. I'm unable to accept $70, but I would like to offer it to you for $85. This still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $85 is a reasonable compromise to ensure I get the product without overpaying."
