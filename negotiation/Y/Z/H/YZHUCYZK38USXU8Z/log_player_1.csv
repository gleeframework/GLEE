{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $100."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $85.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $82.50. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my target price while still giving you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. Let's make it a deal at $80. That's a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's my minimum, it's still a good deal for me, and it's better than selling to John for the same price. I've also learned that Bob is willing to negotiate, so in the future, I could potentially get a better price from him."
