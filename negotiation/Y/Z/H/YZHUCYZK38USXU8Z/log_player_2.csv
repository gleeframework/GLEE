"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is a great value for you. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still potentially profitable for her.  We'll see how she responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate.  She's trying to anchor the negotiation around your perceived value, but we can try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a valuable product, Alice, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about meeting halfway at $77.50?"",
""product_price"": 77.5
}
```

We're getting closer! This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to compromise but still want a fair deal. By suggesting the exact midpoint, it might encourage her to move closer to our desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $82.50. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my target price while still giving you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price that's acceptable. However, we still have some rounds left to negotiate and potentially bring the price even closer to $80.  It's worth another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. Let's make it a deal at $80. That's a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. Offering $80 is aiming for the best possible price. Alice might accept it, giving us the best deal. If she rejects it, we'll need to decide whether to concede a little or consider John's offer as we get closer to the deadline."
