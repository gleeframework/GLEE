"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price. If he's not, I can always lower it in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm not willing to sell it for that low, even though he's interested. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,800 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. This is still a great price for you, considering the value it offers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's still below what I'd ideally want, but it's above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at $8,250, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's also close to my ideal price, so I'll accept his offer. This ensures I make a profit while still securing a deal with Bob."
