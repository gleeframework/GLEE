"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to get the best price possible, and $130 is still above your maximum budget of $120. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

You're starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong opening move that shows you're serious about getting a good deal. It's also a safe bet because it's still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is closer to your budget, you're still aiming for the best possible deal. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price. It's also a safe option because you can still buy from John for $120 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

You're now making a final offer that's at your maximum budget.  This demonstrates your commitment to getting a deal while still respecting your financial limits. If Alice rejects this, you'll know you've reached your limit and can move to John without feeling you left any money on the table."
