"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially offering it to you at $1,150,000.  I'm confident this represents a fantastic opportunity for you.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price better reflects the value I see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is slightly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,130,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, don't you think?",1130000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,130,000 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
