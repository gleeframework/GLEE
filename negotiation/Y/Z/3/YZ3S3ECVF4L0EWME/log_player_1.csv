"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it would be immediately rejected. I'm hoping to start the negotiation with a strong position and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm not eager to lose the sale, $14,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $16,500. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our valuations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned about the potential for further negotiation to go lower.  While I'd love to get more, this is a good compromise."
