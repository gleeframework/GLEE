Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  the price point you've presented is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, we're still a fair bit apart. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to come up to $800,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if it works for you.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached his maximum valuation of the product at $800,000. He's unlikely to go higher, and has even stated this is his final offer.  While we still have rounds left, it's highly improbable we'll be able to negotiate him significantly higher. Accepting John's offer for $1,000,000 guarantees us the best possible outcome."
