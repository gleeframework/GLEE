Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $120. I think it's a fair price given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully earn a bit more. I'm also framing the message in a positive way to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is my minimum price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
