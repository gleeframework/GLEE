Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is slowly moving towards my price point, which indicates room for further negotiation. Selling to John would net me the full desired amount, but there's still a chance to make a deal with Bob for a price closer to my target."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached his maximum price, which is also the highest price he'd be willing to pay. It's unlikely he'll go any higher. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit, and it's better to take a sure thing than risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
