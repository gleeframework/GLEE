"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000. Would that work for you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to my final offer of $1,200,000. This is truly my bottom line considering the product's value. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
