Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd love to sell the product, $10,000 is too low for me. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I think I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. Let's try $11,750. It's a good compromise that keeps us both happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's getting late in the negotiation process, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum price. John is a guaranteed buyer, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure sale."
