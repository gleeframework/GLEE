"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Can you consider $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. Let's try $11,750. It's a good compromise that keeps us both happy. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",11500.0,Bob,6,
