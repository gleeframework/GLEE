"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000. This is a fair price considering my value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, and $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1000000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer.  This would allow us both to close the deal, and I'm confident the product will be a great asset to my business.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make a deal. However, $1000000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
