Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but not so high that it immediately makes him walk away. I believe we can negotiate from here and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the product's value to me. I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's current offer. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the negotiations with Bob seem to be stalling.  I'm confident that John's offer is a fair deal, considering the product's value and the current state of the negotiations."
