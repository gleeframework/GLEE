"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price of $1,400,000, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Margin:**  I'm leaving a $100,000 margin for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still securing a high price for myself. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Time on My Side:** I have 8 rounds left.  Staying in the negotiation gives me more time to see if I can secure a better price.
* **Avoid Settling:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be settling for my minimum. I'd rather continue trying to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,380,000.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring I'm getting a good deal.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I have more information to work with in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $1,365,000 is very close to my initial goal of $1,400,000.  I'm making a good profit and not risking losing the deal for a small amount of money.
* **Time is a Factor:** With 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal while trying to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob won't budge on his offer. Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth negotiations."
