"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think your initial offer is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,075,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's first offer,  I still have 9 rounds and I think I can get a better price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my goal of $1,150,000 in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,075,000 again, and I'm willing to add a small concession - I'll throw in an additional $5,000 for shipping and handling. Can you consider this revised offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,075,000 is tempting and the added $5,000 is a good gesture, I'm not ready to settle yet.  We're still only in Round 4 and I believe I can get a better price.  I'll try to push for something closer to my goal of $1,150,000."

I'm not ready to settle for $1,068,750.  While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, I believe I can still get closer to my goal of $1,150,000 in the remaining rounds. I'll try to push for something a bit higher in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in Round 8 and Bob's offer of $1,058,750 is below my minimum price of $1,000,000. While there are still 2 rounds left, I'm not confident that I can get him to meet my minimum.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the best option at this point, even though it's below my ideal price.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on any profit at all."
