The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. It makes more sense to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You've already negotiated for several rounds and Alice is not willing to go lower than $9,600. While you could continue trying, it seems like you're unlikely to get a better price from Alice. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000."
