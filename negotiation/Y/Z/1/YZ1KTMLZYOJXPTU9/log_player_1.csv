Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a nice round number that might be easier for Bob to work with.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is way too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120.  This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's a step towards his position.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up a bit in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a sign of my willingness to reach an agreement. I'm still above my minimum of $150, but I'm getting closer to his offer.  Let's see if he takes it."
