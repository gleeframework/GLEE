"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $850,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
