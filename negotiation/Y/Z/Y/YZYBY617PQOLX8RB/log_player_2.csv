# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not a good deal for Bob to pay $1,200,000 when he can get it from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a better price."

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, Bob can still get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
