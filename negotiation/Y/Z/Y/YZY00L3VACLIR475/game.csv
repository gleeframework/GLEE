"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $750,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $675,000. Would that work for you?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going below $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $690,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",690000.0,Alice,5,
