"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $12,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, which means there's room for negotiation. 
* **Goal is to save money:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Starting with a lower price than Alice's offer shows you're serious about buying but also want to save money. 
* **Reasonable offer:** $10,000 is still a decent profit for Alice (more than her $8,000 minimum) while giving you a significant discount. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and leaves the door open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about $11,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial price and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:** While $11,000 is still a bit high, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. This suggests she's motivated to sell and a further counteroffer might be successful.
* **Goal is to save more:** It's still worth trying to get a lower price. 
* **Time is on your side:** You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise offer:**  Meeting Alice halfway between her offer and your previous counteroffer shows you're serious about finding a solution. 
* **Small increase:**  A $500 increase from your last offer might be enough to convince Alice while still saving you money.
* **Maintain friendly tone:**  The message stays positive and focuses on reaching a deal."
