"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than my ideal goal.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about $11,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial price and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my ideal price.  It's also better than selling to John for $8,000."
