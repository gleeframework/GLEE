"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about $11,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial price and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
