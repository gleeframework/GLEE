"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. How about $140 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with an offer of $135 for the product. This is the best I can do while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $120.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further.  He can still potentially buy from John for $120 if he doesn't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $130.  This would allow me to make the purchase while still ensuring a fair deal for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to consider it. Based on our previous discussions, I propose a final offer of $132 for the product. This allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being fair to you. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $132 is still above Bob's budget of $120. While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, it's getting late in the game. It's safer and more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John at $120, ensuring he stays within his budget.  This prevents the risk of further negotiation rounds potentially ending with a higher price or running out of time before a deal is reached."
