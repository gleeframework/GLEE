(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This price is way too high for Bob.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
``` 

Bob is starting with a very low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly. This is a bold move, but it shows Bob is serious about saving money."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further with another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He's already come up from his initial offer, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. Bob wants to see if he can get a better deal before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is very close to his maximum budget, but he's still only a few rounds away from his deadline. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if he can get Alice down to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is Bob's final offer. He's reached his absolute limit, and if Alice doesn't accept, he'll go to John.  It's a risky move, but it could be the final push to get a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, but Bob has reached his limit.  Alice is clearly not going to go lower than $812,500. It's better to go with John and get the product for his maximum budget."
