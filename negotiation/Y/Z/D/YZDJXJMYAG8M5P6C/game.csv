"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1000000? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while staying within a range you might be able to manage.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1000000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a decent profit while staying within my financial limits. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,4,
