"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my needs and the value of the product to me.  I believe this is a good starting point for our negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain from this product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you value the product highly, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000,  which is a significant offer given my needs.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm motivated to find a solution. While $1,000,000 is still less than I hoped for, I'm prepared to accept a final offer of $1,600,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end to ensure we can close the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $1,600,000 is closer to my budget.  However, I need to stay within a tighter range. I'm offering a final price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs and the potential value of this product.  If we can reach an agreement, I'm ready to move forward.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
