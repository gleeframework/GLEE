"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is unfortunately below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think that's the highest I can go without going over my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1050000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1125000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget constraints while also reflecting the true value of the product.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
