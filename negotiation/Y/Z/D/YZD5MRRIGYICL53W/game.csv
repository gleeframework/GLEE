"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1500000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1750000. This reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your needs. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the reduction. However, I still feel that the product's value aligns better with a price closer to $1400000. I hope we can reach an agreement that respects both our needs.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
