"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to understanding your perspective."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Starting high establishes a strong position and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Framing the price as an ""investment"" emphasizes the product's value.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  Indicating willingness to listen to Bob encourages him to engage in the negotiation process. 
* **Safety net:** Remember, you have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table. You have room to negotiate further and explore if Bob is willing to increase his offer closer to your target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is considerably below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident this product can generate significant returns for you. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  This reflects a more reasonable compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement:** Acknowledge Bob's offer to show you are engaged in the negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:**  While you made a significant decrease from your initial price, you are still holding firm above Bob's valuation.
* **Value Emphasis:** Reiterate the product's potential to benefit Bob and justify the higher price.
* **Compromise:**  Presenting the new price as a ""compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with movement on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the product's potential, $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our ongoing negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now surpassed your minimum acceptable price and is nearing your walk-away point. While you could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob could walk away or that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
