"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to understanding your perspective. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's in your best interest to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering our respective positions."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than your maximum budget. This approach aims to:

* **Signal seriousness:**  It shows Alice you are genuinely interested in the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** There is enough space between your offer and Alice's potential minimum to allow for further negotiation. 
* **Maintain leverage:** You're not offering the full $1,000,000 right away, leaving some room to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is considerably below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident this product can generate significant returns for you. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  This reflects a more reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue pushing for a lower price and see if you can get closer to your ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand the product's potential, $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our ongoing negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer is closer to Alice's previous price, showing a willingness to meet her halfway. 
* **Maintain a gap:** There's still a $350,000 gap between your offer and Alice's potential minimum, creating room for further negotiation.
* **Test the waters:** This offer tests whether Alice is truly willing to compromise or if she's more focused on her initial asking price."
