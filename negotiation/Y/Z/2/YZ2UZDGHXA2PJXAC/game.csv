"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. How about $9,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to what I can afford, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11000.0,Alice,5,
