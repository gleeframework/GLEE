,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more in the range of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
