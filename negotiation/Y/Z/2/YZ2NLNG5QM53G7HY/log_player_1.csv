Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price for its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering slightly below his max value allows room for Bob to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" if he wants to negotiate further.
* **Backup Option:** We have a strong backup offer from John at $800,000, so we don't need to be desperate.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing us to accept John's lower price."
