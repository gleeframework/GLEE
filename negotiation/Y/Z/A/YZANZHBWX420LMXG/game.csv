"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $25000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for it.  This is my best offer. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $18000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $10000.  This is a fair price for a product that I value at that amount.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll counter with $16000. This is a significant discount from my original price, but I still need to make a profit. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there though.  I'm willing to go up to $12000.  That's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, which is a significant concession from my original price. This is my final offer for now. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
