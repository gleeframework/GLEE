"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is simply too low. It's not even covering my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $11500. Can you consider that?,11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $11500 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $12500? That's a good deal for both of us, and it would be a waste to lose this opportunity.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still trying to get as close to my target as possible. I'd be willing to go up to $12000, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",12000.0,Bob,6,
