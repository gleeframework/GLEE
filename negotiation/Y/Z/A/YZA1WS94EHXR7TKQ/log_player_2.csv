Alice's offer is far too high.  It makes more sense to try and negotiate with her."

I'm starting with a low offer, aiming for the price John is offering.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering. I will try to negotiate further."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,500,000.  This is halfway between my initial offer and Alice's current offer, hopefully encouraging her to meet me in the middle."

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still too high.  I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."

I'm offering $1,600,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and hopefully shows my willingness to negotiate."

Alice is not budging much from her price, and I've already countered several times.  It's clear that we won't be able to reach a deal that's significantly better than what John is offering. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
