Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's counteroffer is quite aggressive!

After considering the options, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob to try to get a better price.

Let's see what Bob's next move is!"
