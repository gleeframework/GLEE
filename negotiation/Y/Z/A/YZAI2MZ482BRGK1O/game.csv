"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to increase your offer, and I appreciate that. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position and I'm still very interested in reaching a deal. How about we settle at $800,000? This is my final offer, as I can always purchase the product elsewhere for that price. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $990,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $980,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal here.",980000.0,Alice,7,
