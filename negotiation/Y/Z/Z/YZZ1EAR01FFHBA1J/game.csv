"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
