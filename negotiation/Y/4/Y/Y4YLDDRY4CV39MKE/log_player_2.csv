"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above your budget of $10,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 9 more rounds to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is a fair reflection of this product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You have several rounds left, so rejecting and continuing to negotiate is the best option.  You can try to get closer to your target price of $10,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,000? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $12,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to accept $13,000 - it's my final offer.  This is a fantastic deal on a product you won't regret owning. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.
