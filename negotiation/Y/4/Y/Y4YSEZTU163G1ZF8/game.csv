"Alice, your product looks great but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $15,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd really like to make this deal happen.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",16250.0,Alice,5,
