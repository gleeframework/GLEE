"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $11,750. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
