This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation. It's also a decent distance from my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to compromise, but not to that extent. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
