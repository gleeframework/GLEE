"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product holds for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you coming down in price.  While $13,500 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for me.",13000.0,Alice,7,
