Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation, but not too high that it would immediately scare Bob away.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price. If not, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum value, and it's likely he'll stick to this price. It's better to accept his offer now and secure the sale rather than risk a prolonged negotiation and potentially losing the sale entirely."
