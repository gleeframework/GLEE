"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a minimum price, but I'm still sticking to my budget of $8000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to look elsewhere.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I've already met you at $10000 and you rejected it. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500. While I value the product, I'm still sticking to my budget of $8000. It's the best I can offer, and I hope you'll reconsider. If not, I'll have to go with another seller.",8000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to come to an agreement, Bob. I've already met you at $10000, then $9500, and you've rejected both. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $9000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options, including selling to someone else.",9000.0,Alice,9,
