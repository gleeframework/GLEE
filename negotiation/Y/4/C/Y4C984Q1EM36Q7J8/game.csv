"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your suggestion, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, considering the value of this product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know your decision.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not able to go lower than $13,500. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Consider it an investment in your future. This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,8,
