Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $90. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob is willing to pay $100, so aiming for a price close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $90 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you still secure a reasonable profit. 

By starting high but leaving some room for negotiation, this offer strategically positions you to get the best possible price from Bob."
