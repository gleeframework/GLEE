"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, considering its potential. Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand you need to stay above $950,000. However, $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to go with John if we can't find an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
