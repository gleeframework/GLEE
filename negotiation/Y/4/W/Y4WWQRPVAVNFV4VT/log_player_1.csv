"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I want to see if I can get Bob to come up a little more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm offering $19,000. This is a compromise between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $18,500. While it's still a bit lower than my initial goal, it's a good price considering the limited rounds remaining.  I'd rather secure this deal than risk getting a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price."
