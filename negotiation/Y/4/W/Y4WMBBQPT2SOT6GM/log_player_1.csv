Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, potentially landing on a price higher than $10,000 (my minimum).
* **Secure the Sale:**  While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, maximizing my profit.

This strategy aims for a win-win situation, offering Bob a good deal while securing a higher profit than my guaranteed alternative."
