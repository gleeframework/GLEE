Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I've seen so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,600,000 is getting closer to a tempting amount, I'm still confident I can get closer to $1,900,000, especially with John as a backup option.  Bob's message indicates he still sees value in the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, $1,900,000 is a significant investment.  How about we settle on $1,750,000? That demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground while acknowledging the value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 4. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is holding firm at $1,600,000 and  we are running out of rounds. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of going below John's offer."
