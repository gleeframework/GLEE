"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
