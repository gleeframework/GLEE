Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I mention the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefit he'd receive. This can make the price seem more reasonable to him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price, showing flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.

This offer strikes a balance between pushing for a high price and fostering a potential negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it demonstrates his interest. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Exploring counteroffers:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price, potentially leading to a deal that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired value but still acknowledges his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This would still be a good deal for you considering the product's value to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  By offering $800,000, I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to his business, emphasizing that $800,000 is still a good deal. This can encourage him to see the offer as more favorable.
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm ending with a question to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to respond.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between maximizing my profit and reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
