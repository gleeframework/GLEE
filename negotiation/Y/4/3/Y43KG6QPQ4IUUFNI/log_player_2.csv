"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to move upwards during the bargaining process.
* **Significantly Lower:** Offering $8,000 is a significant step down from Alice's $14,000, but it's important to signal that her initial price is unacceptable.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and conveys continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  $11,000 is closer to your $10,000 limit but still exceeds it. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice reducing her price suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You have the security of John's $10,000 offer if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range. I could go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Moving from $8,000 to $9,000 shows a willingness to compromise but in smaller increments, indicating you're getting closer to your maximum.
* **Firm Limit:**  Stating ""$9,000 is my absolute limit"" sets a firm boundary, putting the decision pressure on Alice.
* **Still Below John's Price:** Offering $9,000 keeps you below John's offer, maintaining a negotiating advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Offer:** Alice's final offer of $10,000 matches the price you can get from John.
* **No Further Negotiation:** Alice has labeled this her ""final offer,"" signaling she won't go lower. 
* **Achieved Your Goal:** You've successfully negotiated the price down to your target maximum, so there's no benefit to rejecting or trying to buy from John at the same price."
