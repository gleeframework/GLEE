"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know you're looking for something like this, and I'm confident it would be worth at least $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a price below its true value, and I get a fair price for my product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
