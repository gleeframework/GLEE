"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere, and it gives you a great deal.  Let's work together to finalize this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This offer is reasonable given your initial price and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
