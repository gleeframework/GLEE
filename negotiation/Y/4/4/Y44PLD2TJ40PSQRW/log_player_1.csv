{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to accept.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This price is fair considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a significant improvement over John's offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to find a price point that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere, and it gives you a great deal.  Let's work together to finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This offer is reasonable given your initial price and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $1,000,000 is a good deal considering Bob's budget constraints. It's also significantly higher than what I'd get from John. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids further negotiation."
