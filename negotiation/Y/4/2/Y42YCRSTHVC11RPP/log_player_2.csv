"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price that's significantly below its true value to you. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted price and me to secure a substantial return on my investment. Consider this a win-win situation. Please let me know your decision.
