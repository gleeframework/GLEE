Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:** You're leaving some room for negotiation, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **It sets the tone:** You're confident in the product's value but willing to negotiate. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than the initial offer you made. You want to maximize your profits.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:**  You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price point.
* **Maintain bargaining power:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows you're not desperate for a sale and are willing to walk away if necessary. 

It's a calculated risk, but it gives you a better chance of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,750.  This still leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your desired price:** $13,750 is a compromise, but it's closer to your ideal price than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation is still open:** You're not going all-in, keeping the door open for further discussion.
* **You're setting the pace:** This counteroffer shows you're in control of the negotiation and not just accepting whatever Bob offers.

Let's see if this counteroffer gets you closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $14,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,125 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and closer to your desired price range.  

While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of:

* **Stalemate:**  Bob might be firm on his offer, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate.
* **Time wasted:** Continuing to bargain could take time and energy that you could be using elsewhere.
* **Missing out:** If you reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and you could end up selling to John for a lower price.

**Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice.** You get a decent profit while avoiding the potential downsides of further negotiation."
