"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $8250?  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired value.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $7800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $7800 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's settle at $8000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids us needing to go back and forth any longer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
