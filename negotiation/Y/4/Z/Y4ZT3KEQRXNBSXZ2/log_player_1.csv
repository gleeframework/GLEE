Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and Alice might still secure a better price than John's offer.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays of finding another buyer.

This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while also ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
