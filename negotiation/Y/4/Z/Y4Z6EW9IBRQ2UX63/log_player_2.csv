"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what you think is fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation much lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below my maximum budget.
* **Respectful Tone:**  I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone throughout the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true potential of what's on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's counteroffer is a significant reduction, but it's still considerably above my budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's message suggests a willingness to negotiate further.  I'll continue to counter in a way that moves us closer to a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $1,300,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer to show I'm serious while staying well below her current price. This aims to find a middle ground.
* **Justifying the Offer:**  I'm reiterating my interest but also subtly implying that $1,300,000 is my upper limit (even though my true limit is $1,500,000).
* **Maintaining Positivity:**  Continuing to use a respectful and collaborative tone to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I acknowledge your desire for a price that works for you, and I'm committed to finding a solution.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts my initial asking price while still reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Within Budget:**  Alice's final offer of $1,600,000 is above John's offer but still within my budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and pushing further risks losing the deal.
* **Slight Loss Acceptable:** While I'd prefer to pay John's price, securing the product now with a relatively small difference is likely worth it."
