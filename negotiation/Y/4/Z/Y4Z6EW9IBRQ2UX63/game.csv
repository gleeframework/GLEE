"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what you think is fair.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true potential of what's on the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $1,300,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I acknowledge your desire for a price that works for you, and I'm committed to finding a solution.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts my initial asking price while still reflecting the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
