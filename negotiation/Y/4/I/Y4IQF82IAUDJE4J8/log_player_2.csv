# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $175 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget price, $100. This makes it clear that I'm serious about buying the product but won't go higher. It also sets the starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my minimum price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my budget, it's still above my comfortable limit. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. It's worth seeing if I can get Alice closer to my $100 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying from John for $100 if we can't come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise. However, I'm also setting a firm upper limit and making it clear that I have an alternative option. This creates pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  However, $115 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $125.  This is a fair compromise and  gives you a good deal on the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, $125 is still above my comfort zone. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. My final offer is $120. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with John's offer of $100."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing I'm serious about buying the product. However, I'm keeping it within my budget and setting a clear ultimatum.  This gives Alice a strong incentive to accept and avoid losing the deal."
