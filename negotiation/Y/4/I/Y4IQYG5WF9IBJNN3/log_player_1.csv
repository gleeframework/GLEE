{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects that. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving you with a decent profit.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you're not selling yourself short.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It sets the tone for a professional negotiation. 

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffers (or John's potential offer) based on how this negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate with Bob further, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $900,000?  This would give us both a good deal. Let's keep the conversation going!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $875,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'd prefer. I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 890000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above Bob's current offer, signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see the worth in my counteroffer. 

This is my final offer before considering selling to John. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement!"
