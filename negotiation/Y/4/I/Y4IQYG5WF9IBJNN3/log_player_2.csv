You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's limit of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $900,000?  This would give us both a good deal. Let's keep the conversation going!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you think?
