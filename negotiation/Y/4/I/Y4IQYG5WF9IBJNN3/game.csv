,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $900,000?  This would give us both a good deal. Let's keep the conversation going!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $875,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
