Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,375,000? This allows me to still make a fair profit while offering you a significant discount compared to my initial asking price.
