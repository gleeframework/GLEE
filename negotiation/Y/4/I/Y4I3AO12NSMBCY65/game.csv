"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I think it's a fair offer, considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm not quite ready to commit at that price. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to go up to $700000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $750000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.  I believe we're close to a deal, let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'll offer you the product for $800000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
