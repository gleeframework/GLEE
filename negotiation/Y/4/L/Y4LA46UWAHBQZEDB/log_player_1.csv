Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential for you, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $1,300,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a deal compared to his own valuation.

This strategy attempts to strike a balance:

* **Greed vs. Securing the Deal:**  Being too greedy (asking close to $1,500,000) might make Bob reject the offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to John quickly guarantees your minimum but might leave potential profit on the table.

By starting with a strong but potentially negotiable offer, you increase your chances of maximizing your profit while still having room to lower the price slightly if Bob tries to negotiate."
