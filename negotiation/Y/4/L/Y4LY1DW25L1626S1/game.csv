"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can meet you at $13,250, but I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $12,800? I'm trying to stay as close to my target as possible.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,800 is close, but I need to get at least $13,000 for this to make sense.  Do we have a deal at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $13,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,800. How about $12,900? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",12900.0,Bob,6,
