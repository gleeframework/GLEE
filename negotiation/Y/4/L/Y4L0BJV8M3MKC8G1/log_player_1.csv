Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the process and potentially increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Backup Option:** I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me at least $100. This knowledge empowers me to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own perceived value ($120).  There's ample room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer to keep the conversation going and strive for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, while still aiming for a price above my minimum. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This counter-offer ensures I'd make a profit even if Bob accepts immediately.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm encouraging Bob to engage in a back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** While not ideal, $95 is still above my absolute minimum of $100. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further haggling might not yield a significantly better outcome, and could risk Bob walking away. 
* **Profitable Deal:** Accepting secures a profit, which is the ultimate goal."
