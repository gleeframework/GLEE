{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm still making a profit of $4,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** He's still getting a good deal, giving him incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If he rejects, we can still work out a price that benefits both of us.

By leaving room for negotiation, I can potentially get closer to his maximum value while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for profit. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which still allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for. How about $13,000? It's a good compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $10,000 and allows for a decent profit.  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a solid return."
