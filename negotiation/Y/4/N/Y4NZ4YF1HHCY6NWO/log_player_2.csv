It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can still get a good deal, and you might be able to save even more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which still allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get it down a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
