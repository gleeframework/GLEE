"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is a little low for me right now, I could come down to $17,000.  I think that's very fair considering the value you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm getting. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark. Taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John is the best decision at this point to maximize profit."
