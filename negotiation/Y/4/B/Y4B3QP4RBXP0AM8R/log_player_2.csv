"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high for Bob's budget.  He's willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, so there's no chance of accepting at this point.  Rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle a bit â€“ how about $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  He's sticking to his maximum of $800,000 and will continue to negotiate.  Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,200,000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This represents a fair compromise and would allow us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
