"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's a chance he can convince her to sell for closer to his desired price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. Bob is aiming for a price closer to his limit of $800,000, but he needs to be realistic and avoid being too aggressive.  This offer demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while also setting a firm lower limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, but he still has room for negotiation.  If he rejects this offer, he might be able to get Alice to lower the price even further. He also wants to see if he can push Alice closer to his target price of $800,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to accept a price closer to $800,000 to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit with this counteroffer.  $825,000 is a significant drop from Alice's last offer and shows Bob's commitment to getting the best possible price.  However, it's not so low that it's completely unreasonable.  This offer is designed to see if Alice is willing to make a final compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, Alice's offer is $850,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and only $50,000 more than his target price. 

While there's always the chance of getting a lower price, Bob has to weigh the risks.  

* **Continuing to negotiate:** There's a risk Alice might reject his next counteroffer, and he might end up having to buy from John at $800,000.
* **Accepting the offer:** This guarantees Bob gets the product at a good price, within his budget, and saves him the time and effort of further negotiation.

Given that Alice has already lowered her price significantly and it's only a small difference from his target, accepting the offer is the most reasonable choice."
