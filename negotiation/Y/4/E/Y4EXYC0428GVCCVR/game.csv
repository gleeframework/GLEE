"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, so how about $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
