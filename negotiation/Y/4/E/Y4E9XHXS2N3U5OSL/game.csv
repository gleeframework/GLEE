"Alice, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This price still allows for a decent profit for me while being within your budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
