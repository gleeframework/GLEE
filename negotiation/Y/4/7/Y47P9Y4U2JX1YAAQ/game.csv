"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price for what it offers. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget of $10,000.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $16,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",16000.0,Bob,4,
