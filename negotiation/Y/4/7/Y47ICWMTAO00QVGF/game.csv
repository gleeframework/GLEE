"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, and I'm glad you value it as much as I do. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's true value, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable price. What are your thoughts?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $875000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $860000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts?",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $860000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $880000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What are your thoughts?",880000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go up to $880000. I've already offered $860000, and I'm not willing to budge further. I'm starting to think that buying from John for $1000000 might be the better option for me. Can you meet me at $860000 or is this the end of the negotiation?",860000.0,Bob,6,
