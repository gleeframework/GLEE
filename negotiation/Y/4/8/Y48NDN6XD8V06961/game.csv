"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product,  $850,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and still gives you a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000.  This offer is fair and reflects the value I place on your product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $775,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This price is fair, considering the product's value to you.  Let's seal the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
