"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and a fair price for me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $8,500. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I have 8 rounds left, and there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a significant saving over what you value the product at, while ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
