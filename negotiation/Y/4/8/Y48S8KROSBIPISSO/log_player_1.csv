Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $12,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still allowing you to make a substantial profit ($4,000 above your minimum).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing the Sale:** A price closer to $15,000 might scare Bob off, pushing him to reject the offer.
* **Maximizing Earnings:** By offering a price significantly higher than John's offer, you increase your potential profit considerably."
