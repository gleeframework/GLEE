"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $20,000 represents a fair price for its value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer for this.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still beyond what I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the back and forth. I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $14,500?  That's my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I can do $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,6,
