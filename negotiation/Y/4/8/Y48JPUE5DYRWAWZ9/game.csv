,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find this product very valuable. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10250. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10250.0,Bob,4,
