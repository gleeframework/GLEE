"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,500 is an improvement, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within $12,000. Could we perhaps agree on $12,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not able to go that low.  However, I'm feeling flexible and willing to make a final concession. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd hate to see this opportunity slip away.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate the effort. I am still hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $12,800? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",12800.0,Bob,6,
