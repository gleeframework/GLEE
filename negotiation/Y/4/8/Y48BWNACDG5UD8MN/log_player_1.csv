Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also indicates a willingness to compromise, potentially leading to a quicker deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer.  I also need to consider the time spent negotiating and the possibility of selling to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob or sell the product to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,500 is an improvement, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within $12,000. Could we perhaps agree on $12,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to push for a higher price, but I also need to consider the risk of losing the deal with Bob completely. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not able to go that low.  However, I'm feeling flexible and willing to make a final concession. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd hate to see this opportunity slip away.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate the effort. I am still hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $12,800? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final offer I will make to Bob.  While $12,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and I'm starting to feel the time pressure of the negotiation.  Also, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob completely, so I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 offer from John."
