Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my highest possible price.  I know it's unlikely Bob will accept this right away, but it establishes my baseline and leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still less than my minimum.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a compromise closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering a price of $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a little more. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly to $930,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it's possible Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, ensuring I receive at least my minimum value for the product."
