"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting, trying to build a rapport with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, it's not unreasonable. This allows for back and forth without me needing to immediately drop to a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would mean losing money. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?  That's a fair price considering the quality of this product."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low, but I'm also acknowledging his interest and showing flexibility by counter-offering.
* **Compromise:**  My counter-offer is $160, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the product's quality to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $140?  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  It's only $10 above what the product is worth to Bob, and I feel I can potentially get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $140 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $150. That's a fair price, and it gets this awesome product into your hands."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm stance:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Compromise:** I'm presenting the offer as a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Positive reinforcement:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and appealing to his desire to get the product."
