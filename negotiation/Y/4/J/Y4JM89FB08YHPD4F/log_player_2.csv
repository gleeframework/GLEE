"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is offering it for $120. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer.** By rejecting, you can propose a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm interested in the product and would be willing to pay $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a step in the right direction, $110 is still above your ideal price point.
* **Continuing to negotiate is worth it.** There's still room to haggle, and rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open. You can likely get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product and I'm happy to pay $105. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'd be happy to get rid of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $107.50. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your acceptable range.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, and her offer is $107.50. 
* **Further negotiation might be risky.**  You've already gone back and forth a few times, and there's no guarantee Alice will continue to lower her price. 
* **Accepting is a good compromise.** While you might be able to get a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
