"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,500. How about $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
