Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000 vs. $10,000) sets a strong anchor. While this price might seem unrealistic, it gives you room for negotiation and makes any subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The high initial price allows for potential counter-offers from Bob. You can then negotiate down, aiming for a price that is still significantly higher than your minimum ($15,000).
* **Considering the backup option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob, as you don't risk losing the sale entirely.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob knew about John's offer, he would have no incentive to offer more than $15,000."
