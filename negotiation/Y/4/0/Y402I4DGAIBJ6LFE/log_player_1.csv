Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  If Bob rejects, I'm ready to counter-offer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering at $90.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  I believe it's a fair price that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82 is only slightly lower than John's offer of $80.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John and avoids further negotiation.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
