"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm interested in making a deal, $9,500 is too far below my minimum price. I'll see if I can get him closer to my desired price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and closer to my minimum. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10000? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum price, $10,000 is still a decent amount and it's a good outcome given Bob's budget constraints.  It's better than selling to John for $12,000 and risking that I could have gotten a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
