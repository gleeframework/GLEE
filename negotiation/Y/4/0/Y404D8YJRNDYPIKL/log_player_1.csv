"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price ($120) that's still lower than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but still allows me to earn a good profit.  I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $102.50, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of the product. I'm also trying to keep the negotiation friendly and emphasize the value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is pretty close to my desired price point, and with limited rounds remaining, it's a good deal for me.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
