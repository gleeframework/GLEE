"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer it to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
