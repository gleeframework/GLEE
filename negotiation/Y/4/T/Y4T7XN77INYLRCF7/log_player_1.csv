Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth to you in the long run. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and  ""value and potential"" aims to nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" suggests flexibility and openness to counter-offers.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider, given the potential for negotiation."
