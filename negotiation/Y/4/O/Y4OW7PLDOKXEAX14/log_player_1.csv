Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still within the range of value for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,225,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and represents a significant reduction from your previous offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
