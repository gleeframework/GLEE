"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value for the product. I'm curious to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $60, as that is significantly less than my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm reducing my price to $120. This is still a decent profit for me, and I believe it might be more appealing to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a good enough price for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll keep negotiating with Bob, as I might be able to get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $110. This is still a decent profit for me, and I believe it's a more reasonable price for both of us. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and he seems unwilling to offer a price close to my minimum value. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a very low price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking a much lower offer from Bob."
