Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals to Bob that you are serious about selling the product, but you are not desperate to make a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above the price John is offering,  it is still significantly below the value I know the product holds for Bob.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that this price is fair, given the value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $250 less than what John is offering. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  I'll take the $8,750 and move on."
