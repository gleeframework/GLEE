"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but I'm thinking the price needs to come down a bit for me. How about we start at $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  While starting low, the message remains polite and acknowledges the product's value.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how flexible Alice might be on price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. I've been doing some calculations on my end, and to make this work, I'd need to be closer to $720,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. "",
""product_price"": 720000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Instead of a large jump, this offer increases from the previous round by $70,000, showing willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Budget Justification:**  Mentioning a ""budget"" reinforces your price limit and adds a sense of urgency.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The message aims for a price that benefits both parties, acknowledging Alice's position while pushing for a better deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your revised offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Alice's Value:**  Alice has signaled that $775,000 is her lowest acceptable price. Pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal. 
* **Significant Savings:**  You're securing the product for $425,000 less than your maximum budget and $25,000 less than the midpoint between your initial values.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only five rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement and being forced to buy from John at a higher price increases."
