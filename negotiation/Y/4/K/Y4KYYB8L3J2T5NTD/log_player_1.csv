{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you, as you know.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $13,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above $13,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's still closer to my minimum than John's offer. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $13,500 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer $13,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,200 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $12,000.  It's also a reasonable compromise considering the negotiation process."
