Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price close to your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **John as Leverage (Implicit):** While you don't explicitly mention John, knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you confidence in setting a higher price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit but carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* Observing Bob's reaction to the initial offer will be crucial for further negotiation tactics."
