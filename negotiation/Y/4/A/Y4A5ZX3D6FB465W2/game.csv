"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $1050000 at this time.  This is my best price, and I'm confident the product will be a good investment for me at this price point.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $1175000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, I'm still not quite there.  I can go up to $1100000, but that's my absolute limit.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a successful partnership.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1100000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1200000. I'm now offering the product to you for $1150000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
