Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances a few things:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $115 is a little higher than $100, giving Bob a bit of room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, and still earn more than your minimum of $120.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It shows you're willing to negotiate while still setting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a better offer than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $100 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low just yet. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?  I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
