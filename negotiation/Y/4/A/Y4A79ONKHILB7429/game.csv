"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's start from here.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you sharing your perspective. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a middle ground. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still significantly above what I'm able to pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. Let's meet halfway.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer to a realistic figure, it still falls short of what I can accept.  I'm willing to consider $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,650,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
