Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's start from here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's good to know his maximum valuation, accepting would mean a significant loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sharing your perspective. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a middle ground. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still significantly above what I'm able to pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. Let's meet halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is improving, it's still less than John's guaranteed offer. We're getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, so we'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer to a realistic figure, it still falls short of what I can accept.  I'm willing to consider $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,650,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go significantly higher than $1,400,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
