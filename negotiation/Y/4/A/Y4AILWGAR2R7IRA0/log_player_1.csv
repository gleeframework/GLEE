Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's valuation. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I don't need to accept a drastically low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price of $8,000 just yet.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $8,500, which is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still ensures I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $8,000. I'll counteroffer one more time before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $8,200. This is a further compromise, but still within my minimum price range. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer. If not, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I don't want to keep going back and forth. It's time to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John and move on."
