{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $800,000. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and my best chance of securing the product without exceeding my budget. If she rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John, which is still a good outcome, but not ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again.  I'm hoping that Alice is motivated to make a deal and will be willing to come closer to my price. If not, I will happily purchase the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $900,000. This is a compromise between my maximum budget and Alice's last offer. I'm hoping that this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying within a reasonable price range. If Alice rejects this offer, I will be forced to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate one last time. If this fails, I will buy from John. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  I believe $950,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. If Alice rejects this offer, I will buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than my budget of $800,000. It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement at this point, and further negotiation would likely be futile.  It's time to move on and secure the product from John. While I'm not thrilled about paying John's price, it's the most financially responsible decision in this situation."
