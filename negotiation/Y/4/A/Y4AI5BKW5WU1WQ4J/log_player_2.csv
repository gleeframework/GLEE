"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $135 is too high, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. 
* You have a better chance of getting a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $125, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $135 and my maximum price of $150. 
* This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.
*  I believe this is a fair offer, given that the product is worth $120 to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $140 is still higher than my desired price.
* I'm willing to pay $150 from John, so I can still get a better deal by rejecting and making another counteroffer. 
* There is still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has increased her offer to $140, but it's still above my desired price. 
* I'm offering $130, which is in the middle of our last two offers. 
* I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* This offer is also lower than John's price, making it still worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $145 is getting closer to my maximum price of $150.
*  However, I am now at a point where it's more beneficial to buy from John for $150. 
* Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks getting stuck at a price close to $150, and it might not be worth the time and effort.
* Buying from John guarantees I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with, even though it's my maximum."
