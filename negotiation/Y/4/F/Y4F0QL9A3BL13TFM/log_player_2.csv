"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product from John for $12,000, so there's no need to pay more."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your desire to sell it."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so that's the best option for him."
