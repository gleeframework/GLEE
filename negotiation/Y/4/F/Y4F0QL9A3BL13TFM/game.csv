"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in your product,  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $12000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your desire to sell it.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
