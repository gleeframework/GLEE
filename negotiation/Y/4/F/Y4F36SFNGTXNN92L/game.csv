"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,200,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the gap between $900,000 and my valuation is significant.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target of $900,000. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price around this range.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be firm on the value of this product.  $980,000 is my final offer - it represents a significant discount already.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $980,000, which is $940,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price point.",940000.0,Bob,6,
