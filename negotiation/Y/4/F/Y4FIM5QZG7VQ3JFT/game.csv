"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. This allows me to stay within my budget while still providing you with a fair price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $95? That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
