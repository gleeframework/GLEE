Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really find it useful.  I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than $80, giving Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your minimum of $120, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary. 

By starting with a slightly higher price and leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of getting a good price while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price.  By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This counteroffer offers a middle ground between Bob's offer of $85 and my previous offer of $100.  This shows willingness to compromise and makes the offer seem reasonable.
* **Still Above My Minimum:** $92.50 is still above my minimum of $120, giving me some room to negotiate further if necessary.
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes finding a good deal for both of us, creating a more collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. This allows me to stay within my budget while still providing you with a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm still willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and John's offer of $120.  If Bob doesn't come up with a price closer to my minimum, I might just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $95? That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This counteroffer represents a final attempt to reach a mutually acceptable price before resorting to selling to John.
* **Near Minimum:**  $95 is still slightly below my minimum of $120, but it's close enough that I'm willing to accept it if Bob agrees.
* **Positive and Direct:** The message focuses on finding a fair price and emphasizes the potential for a final deal, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
