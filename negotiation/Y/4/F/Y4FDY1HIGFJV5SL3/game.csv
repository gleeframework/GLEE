"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be around $100 to you. Let's aim for a fair deal. How about we start at $95?",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. While $95 is a good starting point, my budget is a bit tighter. I'm willing to offer $85 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your response, Bob. I'd like to counter your offer with $90 for the product. This still allows us to find a fair compromise while respecting both of our interests.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. $90 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go to $88 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  I think this allows us to find a price that works for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this.",88.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to counter with $89 for the product. This keeps the deal fair while moving closer to each other's positions.",89.0,Alice,5,
