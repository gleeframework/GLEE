"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This price still leaves some room for you to profit, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my maximum budget for this product. This price reflects the value I place on the item and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",10000.0,Bob,4,
