It's worth trying to get a better price.  $110 is still too high for you. You can counteroffer and see if Alice will come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Alice has come down a bit, and $105 is a good deal for you. It's still within your budget and saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
