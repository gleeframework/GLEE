Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she should aim for a price higher than that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it might be tempting enough if he highly desires the product. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  A quicker sale to Bob, even at a slightly lower price than selling to John, might be preferable. This is the concept of ""time value of money"" â€“ getting paid sooner can be advantageous. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation skills, Alice might adjust her price slightly. However, she should not go below $12,000 unless she's facing a time constraint or other factors that make John's offer less certain."
