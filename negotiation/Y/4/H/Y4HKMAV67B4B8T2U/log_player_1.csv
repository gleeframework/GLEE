Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:**  $10,000 is still below the value Bob places on the product ($8,000), making it a potentially appealing deal for him. 
* **Value for Alice:** $10,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $12,000, as it yields a higher profit for Alice.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's room for Bob to counteroffer if he wishes to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still being competitive enough to potentially entice Bob to buy."
