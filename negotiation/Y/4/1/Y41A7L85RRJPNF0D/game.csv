"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
