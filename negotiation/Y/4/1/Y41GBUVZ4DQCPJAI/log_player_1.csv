"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go above $900000. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $1,000,000 value by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is getting closer, I'm still limited by my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $975000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not entirely satisfied.  I believe there's room for more negotiation, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  I want to maximize my earnings, and selling to John for $1,000,000 would mean leaving some money on the table. Therefore, I'll continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
