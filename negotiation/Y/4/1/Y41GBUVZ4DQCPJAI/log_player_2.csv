# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go above $900,000. This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** Starting with a lower offer than John's price establishes a strong negotiation stance.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1050000.
