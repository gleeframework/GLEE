Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's beneficial to start with an offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) but above your minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $115 signals that you're open to negotiation but still value the product highly. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping John's offer ($100) in mind provides a safety net. You won't accept anything less than $100, making your position stronger in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get it for a bit cheaper. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both your initial asking price and your minimum acceptable price. While he expressed interest, his offer is too low to accept immediately. 

By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but not at such a steep discount. You'll aim for a counteroffer closer to your desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Would you consider $105? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($90), demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The $105 price point keeps you comfortably above your $100 minimum while still leaving room for Bob to potentially counter.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is concise and directly addresses the price difference, making your position clear."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $105. How about $98? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, and it's still a good price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $98 is still slightly below your ideal price, it's now within a reasonable range. Consider these factors:

* **Profitable:**  $98 is still a profit over your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has incrementally increased his offer, showing he's serious about buying. Holding out for more might backfire.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the sale and lets you move on."
