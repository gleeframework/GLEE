"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and I need to ensure a fair return.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still too high for me though.  My maximum is $10,000, and I really think that's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he is unlikely to reach my minimum price of $12,000.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It's time to move on to ensure a profitable outcome."
