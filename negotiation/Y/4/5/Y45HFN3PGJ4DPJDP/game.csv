"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and I need to ensure a fair return.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still too high for me though.  My maximum is $10,000, and I really think that's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",10000.0,Bob,4,
