Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be perfect for your needs. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Incentive for Bob:** This price is still lower than what Alice would get from John, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and benefits, making it more appealing to Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,500 is significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** Rejecting the offer allows Alice to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** Even if the negotiation with Bob fails, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for a much higher price. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit by rejecting a low offer and using John's offer as leverage in future negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** $13,000 is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize value and benefits:** The message reminds Bob of the product's worth and the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Maintain negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive, giving Alice more time to potentially secure a better price or ultimately sell to John.

This strategy balances the need for a reasonable profit with the desire to maintain the negotiation and potentially get closer to Alice's desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $13000. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. Would you be willing to meet me at $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum acceptable price:** $12,800 is only slightly below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Good potential deal:** It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly higher price, as Bob is already close to his maximum budget.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John would yield a higher price, there's a chance that Bob might decide to walk away completely, leaving Alice with no sale at all.

By accepting this offer, Alice secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the sale to John."
