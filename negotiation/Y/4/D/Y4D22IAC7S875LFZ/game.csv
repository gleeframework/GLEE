"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little further.  I'm happy to offer the product for $10,500. This price is still a significant discount for you and closer to my minimum value. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
