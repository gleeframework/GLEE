Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $12,000 is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging. It highlights the value of the product and emphasizes the discount being offered. This creates a positive atmosphere for the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You've successfully sold the product and earned $12,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** You can either counteroffer or move on to John.  
    * **Counteroffer:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's counteroffer and your own willingness to negotiate. 
    * **Move to John:** If you feel like you're not getting close to your minimum value with Bob, you can always sell to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and even lower than the initial offer of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum value. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little further.  I'm happy to offer the product for $10,500. This price is still a significant discount for you and closer to my minimum value. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** This price is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer. It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but still protects my interests.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer and emphasizes the discount while maintaining a positive and encouraging tone. It also sets the stage for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product and earned $10,500.
* **If Bob rejects:** I can either counteroffer again or move on to John.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I don't accept a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $9,750 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While it's closer than his initial offer, I'm not comfortable accepting a price that's so far below what the product is worth to me. 

I've already made a significant compromise by lowering my price to $10,500. It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me halfway, and further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a mutually acceptable price. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. This will ensure that I receive my minimum value and avoid a loss on the deal."
