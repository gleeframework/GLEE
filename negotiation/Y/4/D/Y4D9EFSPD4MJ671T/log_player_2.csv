"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual limit. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a better chance of securing a lower final price.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is crucial. 
* **Clear Objective:** The counteroffer clearly states your desired price, leaving no room for misinterpretation."
