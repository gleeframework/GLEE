{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high. It's above your maximum budget and even more than what the product is worth to her.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if I can get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm still sticking to a price that's within my budget. It's likely that Alice will need to come down further in order to close the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is now at the value the product is worth to her, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get a lower price or see if Alice is willing to close the deal at her ""fair"" price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,400,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price.  With only four rounds left, I need to see if we can close the deal at a price that's mutually beneficial."
