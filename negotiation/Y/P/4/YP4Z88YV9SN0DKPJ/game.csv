"Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference at $110?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",110.0,Bob,4,
