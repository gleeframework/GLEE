# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since you can potentially get the product for less than $120."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to negotiate further.  There's room for compromise, and rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer to see if you can get an even lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference at $110?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $118? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you wanted to spend less, $118 is still a good deal compared to John's price of $150.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but it's likely that Alice won't budge much more. Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price and saves you time."
