Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $22,000 is a bit out of my price range.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,000.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $14,000, which is a fair price given the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a meeting point.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 threshold. Accepting his offer now would mean losing potential profit. John provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
