"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it can significantly benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $22,000 is far beyond his budget and it's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, however, the product's value is considerably higher than that.  I could consider letting it go for $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for compromise, and he can always fall back on buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to find a middle ground here. While $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to accept $16,000. This is my final offer, as I know I have other interested buyers.

Bob should reject the offer.  While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his preferred price. He should try to make a counteroffer, as Alice states she has other interested buyers, she might be willing to negotiate.  He can always fall back on buying from John if negotiations fail."
