"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make it worth your while. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $9,500. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially offer a lower price, closer to her $8,000 value."
