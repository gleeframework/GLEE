Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your perspective.  However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product has higher potential, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price point that's significantly closer to my $1,000,000 minimum. It's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John for a slightly higher potential offer from Bob."
