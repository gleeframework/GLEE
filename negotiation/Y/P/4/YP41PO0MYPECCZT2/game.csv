"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value to you. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to John for $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
