"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice is offering it at exactly your maximum price.  While you're not losing money, you're also not saving any.  Since you have the option of buying from John at the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with John."
