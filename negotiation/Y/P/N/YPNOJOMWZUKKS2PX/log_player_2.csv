"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me. Let's start with a fair price. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is close to her value, leaving little room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($70) to gauge Alice's flexibility. This anchors the negotiation lower and leaves room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite & Open:** The message is polite and expresses interest, but also clearly states our budget limitations. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help us understand how much Alice is willing to deviate from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand your position. Let's aim for a middle ground. How about $85 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, indicating she's open to negotiation. However, the decrease is relatively small.  We'll continue negotiating to see if we can push the price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $85 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $75. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm (For Now):** We're keeping our counteroffer at $75, reiterating our desired price range. This signals that we're serious about the lower price point.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  While firm, the message still emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price. We don't want to appear inflexible and risk Alice walking away.
* **Evaluating Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will reveal if Alice is willing to meet us closer to our target price or if she's holding firm in the $80+ range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try $80. Is that within your budget? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down to $80, which is a $20 saving from her initial offer and a reasonable price considering the product's value to both of us.
* **Limited Time:**  We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds, and continuing to push might make Alice less willing to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we might be able to get the price down slightly more, the potential savings are not worth the risk of Alice backing out or the time cost of further negotiation."
