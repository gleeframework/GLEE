"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum budget of $100. 
* **You can do better:** You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price.
* **John is a backup option:** While buying from John is an option, it's still more expensive than potentially getting a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price.
* **You can likely negotiate further:** Alice is showing willingness to compromise, so there's still room for a better deal.
* **John is still the backup:** You want to avoid paying the full $100 if possible."
