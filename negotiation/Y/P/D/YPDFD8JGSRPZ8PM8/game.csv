"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $8,200? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for working with me. $8,200 is still a bit beyond my ideal price point. I'd be willing to meet you at $7,800. Let me know if that works for you.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your ideal price as possible, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,800. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $8,100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",8100.0,Alice,7,
