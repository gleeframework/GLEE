"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that while still being fair for me.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $1,050,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and I'm confident the product will be worth every penny to you. Let's find a way to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $975,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,012,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll see the value in the product. Let's make this deal happen!",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $1,012,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $985,000. I believe this is a reasonable price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",985000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $985,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product. Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,7,
