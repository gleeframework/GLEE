Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price from him or John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $975,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
