{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm thinking $20,000 would be a fair price, but I'm open to discussing it further. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and open to discussion, making Bob feel comfortable and potentially more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's a chance he might be willing to pay more. Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation and the potential to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $15,000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $17,500? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate, which is crucial to keep Bob engaged.
* **Midpoint:**  The price is a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's, suggesting a genuine effort to find common ground.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, making it seem more logical and fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $16,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for better offer:**  While there's always a chance Bob might go higher, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer significantly, especially since he's already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.

**It's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that's very close to my minimum acceptable price.**"
