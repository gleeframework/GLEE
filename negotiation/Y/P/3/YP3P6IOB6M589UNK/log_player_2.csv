"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While you want to save money, $125 is still a better deal than $150. 
* **You're willing to spend up to $150:** This means you're willing to pay a premium to get the product. 
* **It's in your best interest to accept:**  You'll still save money compared to buying from John."
