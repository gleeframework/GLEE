{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still buying the product. 
* **Alice's Offer:** $115, which is more than you're willing to pay.
* **Alternative:**  You can buy the product from John for $120.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:**  Save money, so offering a lower price is crucial.
* **Counteroffer:** $105 is a reasonable starting point, as it's closer to your ideal price but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  A friendly and polite message shows you're open to a deal but need to find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I'm willing to go a little higher, but $110 is still a bit steep.  How about $108? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:**  Still trying to save money but recognize the need to be flexible.
* **Counteroffer:** $108 is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to compromise, but still below Alice's latest offer. 
* **Message:**  Reiterate your interest in the product and emphasize the fairness of the proposed price."
