Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge the value of this product, $1,800,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000,  which is still a significant amount and reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a significant amount, demonstrating my commitment to acquiring this product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise and demonstrates my commitment to purchasing this product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting the $1,450,000 offer secures a significant profit above the $1,200,000 fallback option with John.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob for a comparatively small potential gain."
