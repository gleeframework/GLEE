"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value of $8,000 and my value of $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair compromise considering our initial offers.",8800.0,Alice,3,
