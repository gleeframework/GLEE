"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm offering you the product for $8,900.  This price is fair considering the value you've placed on it and the time we've spent negotiating.",8900.0,Alice,5,
