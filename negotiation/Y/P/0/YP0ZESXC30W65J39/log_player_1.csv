Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $8,750.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm offering you the product for $8,900.  This price is fair considering the value you've placed on it and the time we've spent negotiating."", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,750 and $8,900. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $8,825?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,825. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, this offer is close enough to my desired range, and it's still more than what I'd get from selling to John."
