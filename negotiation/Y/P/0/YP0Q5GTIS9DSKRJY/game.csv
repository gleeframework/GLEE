"I understand you're interested in the product, but $90 is a bit low for me. I can meet you halfway, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $110, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you right in the middle at $105, but I need you to agree to this price now, as I'm getting close to considering other offers.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I've already met you at $105, and now you're offering $85? I'm not going to go that low. I'll make one final offer: $108, and that's as low as I'll go.",108.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not willing to pay $108. I'll stick to my previous offer of $85. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to walk away.",85.0,Bob,10,
