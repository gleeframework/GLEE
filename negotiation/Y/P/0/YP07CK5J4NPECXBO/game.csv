"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my minimum price of $1,200,000 as possible. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it's closer to what I'm able to spend.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $975,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm trying to get as close to my minimum price as possible. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us, considering your minimum price and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $925,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $910,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's settle on this amount and finalize the transaction.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $910,000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $920,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider selling the product to another buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,200,000.",920000.0,Alice,7,
