"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good deal but leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I want to see if I can push for a better deal before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not giving away the product for a low price. This should keep the negotiations going and hopefully move us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, and we're already in round 4.  I don't want to risk losing this deal to John, especially since we are getting close to my minimum."
