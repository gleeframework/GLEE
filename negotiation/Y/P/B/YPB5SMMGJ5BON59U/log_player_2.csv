You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not interested in overpaying for the product. Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than what I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000) and also lower than the product's value to me, I'll accept her offer.
