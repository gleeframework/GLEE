{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, leaving room for negotiation. $18,000 is significantly higher than your minimum price of $12,000, and it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $15,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this moment. How about $12000?  I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I think this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, so I will accept his offer."
