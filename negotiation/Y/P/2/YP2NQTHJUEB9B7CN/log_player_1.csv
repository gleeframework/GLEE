Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about we try $90? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has clearly stated he's not willing to go above $100.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John at $100, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob. Accepting Bob's $90 offer would be a loss, and further counteroffers risk alienating Bob and losing both potential buyers."
