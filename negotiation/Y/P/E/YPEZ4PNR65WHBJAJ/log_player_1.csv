Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to you, so I think this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is greater than your minimum of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there is room for him to counteroffer.
* **It's a fair price:**  You are offering a discount from Bob's perceived value, which should make him feel like he's getting a good deal. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you have the opportunity to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to Bob's valuation while still earning more than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would you be willing to consider $100 as a fair price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a higher price:**  Bob values the product at $150, meaning there's still room to increase the price. 
* **Testing Bob's limits:** By rejecting his offer, you can gauge how committed he is to buying the product and potentially get him to budge.
* **Negotiation is key:**  A counteroffer allows you to showcase the value of the product and potentially reach a price closer to your desired outcome.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you'll need to counter Bob's offer with a price that's above $100 but still attractive to him.  A price of $115 or $120 could be a good starting point, emphasizing the value of the product and leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. Considering the product's worth to you, I'd be willing to come down to $115. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing price and negotiation:**  $115 is a compromise between your minimum and Bob's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a better price. 
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, subtly suggesting that $115 is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining negotiation space:**  $115 leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counters again, allowing you to potentially reach a price closer to your desired outcome."
