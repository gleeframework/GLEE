Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I believe it will be very valuable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to get a price closer to your ideal. 
* **Not too high:**  While Bob values the product at $80, setting the price extremely high (e.g., $200) will likely make him immediately reject the offer. We want to stay within a reasonable range.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value to Bob, we're subtly justifying the higher price, even if it's slightly above his perceived value. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider. If Bob rejects this initial offer, we can always negotiate down or sell to John for our guaranteed $80."
