Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the $10,000 offer leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The price is significantly above your $8,000 minimum, ensuring a profitable deal.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of $10,000 makes it a calculated risk worth taking. If Bob rejects, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
