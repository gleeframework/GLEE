Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is substantial, it's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll counter in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. It's still a risk to hold out, but I'll try one more time to see if I can get closer to $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect that. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly. My final offer is $1,175,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."",
