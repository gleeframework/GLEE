Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to find a price that works for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800?

**Reasoning:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $9,800 is still a significant profit above my minimum ($8,000). It's better to accept a good offer now than risk the negotiation going further down and potentially losing the deal altogether."
