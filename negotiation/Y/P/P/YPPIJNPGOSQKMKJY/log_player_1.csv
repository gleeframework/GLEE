{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's below my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It also shows I'm willing to be flexible, which can help build trust."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so how about $100? Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to be a bit more creative. How about we go with $105? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not willing to pay $105. I'd be willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $95 is still below my minimum.  While I'd like to keep negotiating, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  It's better to sell to John for $150 and guarantee a profit."
