"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so how about $100? Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to be a bit more creative. How about we go with $105? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not willing to pay $105. I'd be willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
