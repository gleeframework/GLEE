"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair price and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",85.0,Alice,5,
