"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering it to you for $900,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I know this product is valuable, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $700,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to make a deal today if it works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're serious about making a deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot with the offer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a good price for you, considering the value you place on the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
