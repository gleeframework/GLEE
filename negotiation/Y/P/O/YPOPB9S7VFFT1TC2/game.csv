"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $11,000? I think that would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to get this product.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
