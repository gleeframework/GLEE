Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. While I have other interested buyers, I believe this would be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,100,000. This offer is valid for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a significant profit margin for you ($300,000) while still offering Bob a substantial discount from your backup offer ($100,000 less than John's offer).
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a favorable price and ensuring you don't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
