"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
