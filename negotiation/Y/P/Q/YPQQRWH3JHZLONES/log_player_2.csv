"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to own a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000). While it's a good starting point, Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to discuss this further, but my initial counteroffer is $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value is still a bit higher than your offer. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still below what Bob is willing to pay. He wants to save as much money as possible. By rejecting the offer, he can continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too far off for me. Let's keep moving towards a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's reach an agreement before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your latest offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come up a bit, the offer is still below what Bob wants to pay. He has a few more rounds to negotiate and can potentially push for a better price. It's also worth considering that buying from John would cost him $1,200,000, so even at $1,075,000, Bob is saving money. He can use this knowledge to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's make this happen before time runs out. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,075,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to offer, considering the product's value to me. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a personalized setup service, worth $20,000, if you're willing to meet me at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob still wants to save more, Alice is clearly firm on her price.  By accepting this offer, Bob secures a deal for $1,075,000, saving him $125,000 compared to buying from John. Additionally, he receives a valuable warranty and setup service worth $20,000, which further adds value to the deal.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, it's a strategic move to close the deal and avoid potentially losing out to John or reaching a stalemate with Alice."
