Bob's offer:

I'm going to try to get a higher price than Bob's offer.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm seeking.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $1,012,500 is close to my minimum and higher than what I'd get from John.  It's time to close the deal."
