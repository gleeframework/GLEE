"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can save money by negotiating with Alice.  $95 is too high, so you'll reject and try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit out of my budget. How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
