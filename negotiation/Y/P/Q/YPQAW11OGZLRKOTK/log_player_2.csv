"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price of $14,000. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for an even lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than $13,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and his ideal price is below $13,000.
* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice's counteroffer of $14,500 is still higher than Bob's preferred price, but it shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room to lower the price further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process."
