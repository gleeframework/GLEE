It's always a good idea to start with rejecting the initial offer. This gives you leverage to negotiate a lower price.  You have plenty of rounds left, and you can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation stalls."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
