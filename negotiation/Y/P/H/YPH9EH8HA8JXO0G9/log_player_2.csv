"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget.** Bob is willing to spend up to $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is less than that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy for Bob to save money while still acquiring the product."
