""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer won't last long, as I have other interested parties."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could net you a quicker, easier sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 is significantly more appealing to Bob than his perceived value of $1,000,000.  It represents a substantial potential profit if he utilizes it effectively.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
