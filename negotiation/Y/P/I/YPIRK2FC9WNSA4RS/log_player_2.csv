# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. Would you be interested in purchasing it from me for $1400000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

You can get the product for less than $1,400,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:

You can likely still get the product for less than $1,300,000. Let's see if Alice is willing to budge a bit more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still looking to maximize my profit on this deal. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1275000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

You've successfully negotiated the price down to $1,275,000, which is a good deal for you considering your budget. It's not quite your initial goal of $1,200,000, but it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
