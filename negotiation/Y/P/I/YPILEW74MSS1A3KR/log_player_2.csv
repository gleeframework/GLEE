"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save even more.  By rejecting, Bob can start a negotiation and potentially get a lower price.  He has nothing to lose by trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer. He's aiming for a significant discount, hoping to entice Alice to negotiate further.  $800,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's original offer, but it still leaves room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a significant discount from her original price and only $50,000 more than Bob's counteroffer.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept. Further negotiation might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting and Bob having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential gain.  Accepting ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without unnecessary risk."
