"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500?  This is still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could we agree on $7,500? That would work well for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $7,500 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",8000.0,Alice,5,
