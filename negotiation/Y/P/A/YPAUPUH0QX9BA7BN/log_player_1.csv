Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. It's worth $120 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his maximum valuation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Value Proposition:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him reinforces why he should pay a higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk and potential reward by aiming for a price significantly higher than your backup offer from John."
