Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my guaranteed sale price to John. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, prompting Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.
* **Justification:**  While I don't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, I emphasize its overall value and potential, subtly justifying the high price. 

**Goal:** The aim is to find a sweet spot where Bob perceives the deal as valuable enough to accept, even if it's slightly above his initial valuation, while maximizing my profit."
