{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Messaging:** A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for a few rounds of negotiation before reaching my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds. 

**Important Notes:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150, so I won't accept any offers below that. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This is just the first offer. I will adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** While John is a guaranteed buyer at $150, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. I'd rather see if I can get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $150, but still lower than my initial offer. This will show flexibility while keeping my profit margin in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that would significantly undercut my profit. 
* **Fairness:** $140 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm trying to find a middle ground.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly tone continues to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still above my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects, I can further negotiate, but I'll be prepared to sell to John if the price drops too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Losing Bob:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might end up selling to John at a lower price.
* **Time Factor:** While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm not sure how much longer Bob is willing to negotiate. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal entirely.

**Decision:**

Even though I'd prefer to get $150, accepting Bob's offer of $130 is a reasonable compromise. It's still a decent profit, and I avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
