"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,3,
