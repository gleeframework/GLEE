"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1000000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1100000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not ready to accept $1120000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1125000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000.
