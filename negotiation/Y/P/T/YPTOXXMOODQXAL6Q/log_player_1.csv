Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $12,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic balance:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some incentive to consider the deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** You still have a buffer and a good chance of closing the deal with John if Bob rejects. 

This approach maximizes your chances of getting a good price while still being open to a negotiation with Bob."
