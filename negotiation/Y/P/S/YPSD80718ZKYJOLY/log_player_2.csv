"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good deal.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's much better to accept her offer and save $250,000 compared to buying from John."
