"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This is the best first move.  $20,000 is far too high for Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

Bob starts with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals his serious interest while pushing for a more favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $18,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  He's shown Alice he's willing to negotiate, so continuing the negotiation might get him a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

``` 
Bob is now taking a more cautious approach.  He's increasing his counteroffer, but only to a point that's still significantly lower than Alice's price.  This shows he's willing to meet halfway, but only if Alice is serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $17,000 is getting closer to Bob's max budget, it's still too high.  Bob wants to save as much as possible, and there's a chance he can negotiate a lower price.  Plus, there's still the option of buying from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
``` 

Bob is showing his determination to get the best price. He's increasing his counteroffer again, but still staying within his budget.  He's demonstrating a willingness to compromise but also making it clear that he's not going to overpay."
