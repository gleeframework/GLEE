Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $140 is a strong starting point, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Securing a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $130 or even $125 is still more profitable than selling to John for $120."
