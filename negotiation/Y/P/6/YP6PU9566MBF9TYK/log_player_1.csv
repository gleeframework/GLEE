It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,105,000 is a strong profit above my minimum ($1,000,000) and a good deal in the current negotiation.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above this offer.  The time and effort might not be worth the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.
* **Bird in Hand:** I have a firm offer on the table.  There's always a chance negotiations could stall, leaving me to accept John's lower offer later."
