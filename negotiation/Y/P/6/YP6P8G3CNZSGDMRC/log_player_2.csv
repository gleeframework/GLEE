"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since you are willing to pay $12,000 for the product from John, there is no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice will lower her price or buy from John."
