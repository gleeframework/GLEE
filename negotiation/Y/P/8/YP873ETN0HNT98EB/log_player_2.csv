This is a tough choice, but Alice's offer is way above your budget. You need to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You're still above your budget, but Alice is showing some flexibility. It's time to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  If you're interested in making a deal, let me know. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, so let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still too high. While you could try to negotiate further, you're running out of rounds and the risk of not getting a deal is high.  At this point, it's safer to go with John's offer."
