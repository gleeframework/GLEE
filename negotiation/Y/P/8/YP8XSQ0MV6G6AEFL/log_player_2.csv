Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a fair price. My initial offer is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my $800,000 limit. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which reflects its value while keeping it within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but we're getting closer!  You'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. My counteroffer is $980,000. I think this price is reasonable and reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for you.  You're getting close to your limit, but it's better to cut your losses and buy from John at this point. You've negotiated for a few rounds and made it clear you're serious, but Alice isn't budging.  It's time to move on."
