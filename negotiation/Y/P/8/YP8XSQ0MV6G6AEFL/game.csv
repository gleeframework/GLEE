"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a fair price. My initial offer is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my $800,000 limit. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which reflects its value while keeping it within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. My counteroffer is $980,000. I think this price is reasonable and reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
