"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth more than $100 to me. I'm looking to sell it for $150 in this first round. Please let me know if this price works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $100 to you. Alice's offer of $150 is too high. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $95 in this round. Please let me know if this price works for you or if you would like to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than what the product is worth to you, but it's closer to your maximum price of $100.  It's likely that you can get a better price if you continue negotiating, but there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at $100. Accepting this offer guarantees you the product at a price that's only slightly higher than your desired price point."
