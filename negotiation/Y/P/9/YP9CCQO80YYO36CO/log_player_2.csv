# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering your desire to sell and my desire to purchase."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $10,200, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You're not sure if you can get her to drop the price further, and you're running out of rounds.  It's best to take the safe option and buy from John for $10,000."
