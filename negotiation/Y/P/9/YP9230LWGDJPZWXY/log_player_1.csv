"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. 

Even though Bob has shown some willingness to move closer to my asking price, we're running out of rounds. I don't want to risk getting stuck at a lower price. John's offer guarantees me the $8,000 I need, and I'd rather secure that than continue negotiating."
