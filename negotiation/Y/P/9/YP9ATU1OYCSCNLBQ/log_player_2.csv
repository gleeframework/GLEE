"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's no reason to jump to John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down as much as possible.  He knows Alice values the product at $8,000, so offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  He's leaving some room for compromise and showing that he's serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He has room to negotiate further without risking losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,750.  This is the best I can do at the moment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, but he's still pushing for a lower price.  Offering $8,750 shows a commitment to compromise while still keeping his goal of getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really close, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,875? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down significantly.  While $8,875 is still slightly higher than his ideal price, it's a good deal, especially considering the limited time remaining.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to settle for John's higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids potential risks."
