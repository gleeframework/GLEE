"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8,500. However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $8,250, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,250, but I need to make a profit. I can do $8,375, and that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer for now.",8375.0,Alice,5,
