# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better price. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $9,500."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $10,800 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to buy from John and save $2,800."
