Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing and mention of other buyers might nudge him to consider it. 
* **Time Value of Money:** A faster sale to Bob, even at a slightly lower price, might be more advantageous than waiting for the guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters, but I won't go below my minimum of $1,200,000."
