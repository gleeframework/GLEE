Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
