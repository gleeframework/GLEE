"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a bold opening that signals you believe your product is worth a premium.  

**Why this approach?**

* **High starting point:**  It sets the tone for a profitable deal. 
* **Room for compromise:**  By not asking for the full $1,200,000, it allows for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal even if he needs to negotiate down.
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer will give you an idea of Bob's willingness to pay and how flexible he might be. 

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. The key is to be prepared to adapt your strategy based on Bob's reactions and potential counteroffers."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant amount less than your initial offer.  By rejecting, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  It shows Bob that you're not desperate to sell and are willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Signal willingness to negotiate:** It avoids a quick sale at a price you may later regret.
* **See if Bob is willing to compromise further:**  It allows you to gauge his true upper limit.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you will have the opportunity to counter Bob's offer. This will be your chance to either:

* **Offer a lower price:**  Perhaps a slightly lower price than your initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain your price:**  If you believe Bob's counteroffer is still too low, you can reiterate your previous price, hoping he'll come closer to your asking.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while also being flexible enough to secure a deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway. It's a strategic move that:

* **Shows flexibility:** It indicates you're open to negotiation and willing to lower your price slightly.
* **Maintains value:** It avoids selling for a significantly lower price than your desired amount.
* **Signals potential for agreement:** It's a reasonable price point that might encourage Bob to accept.

**Why not a lower offer?**

While a lower offer might seem appealing, it risks losing leverage and possibly leading to a lower final price.  This counteroffer keeps a balance between compromise and holding your ground.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If Bob accepts, great! You've closed the deal at a good price. 
* **Prepare for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, be ready to counter again or consider selling to John if you believe the deal with Bob isn't likely to work out."
