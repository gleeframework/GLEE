"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but the price is a little high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price of $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to come down a bit more. Would you be open to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
