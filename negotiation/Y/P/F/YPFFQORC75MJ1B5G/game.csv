"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the market value of the product is much higher.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $7500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8500. This is still a great deal, considering the market value of the product is $12000.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $8000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's market value.",8750.0,Alice,5,
