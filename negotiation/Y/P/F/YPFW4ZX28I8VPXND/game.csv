"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me and allows us both to make a deal.  Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession.
