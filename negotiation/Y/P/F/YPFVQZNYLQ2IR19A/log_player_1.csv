"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's a bit more than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to find this offer attractive since it's below his perceived value of $12,000.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's not terrible.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he'll come up a bit.  I'm not too worried about John's offer at this point, as $10,500 is still better.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I think it shows a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both willing to negotiate and agree to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough one.  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my ideal price, but it's still better than selling to John. I think at this point, we're getting closer to the middle ground and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
