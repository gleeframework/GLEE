Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $80, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $95 offers a reasonable markup from your minimum price while still being potentially attractive to Bob if he values the product at $80.
* **First Refusal Incentive:** By phrasing it as an exclusive offer before a wider release, you add a subtle sense of scarcity and value. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob (e.g., is he price-sensitive? does he value exclusivity?) and your risk tolerance, you might adjust the price and message accordingly."
