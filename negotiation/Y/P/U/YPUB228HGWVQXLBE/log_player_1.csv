Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  While the product is worth $150 to you (and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price), starting at $150 with Bob is too high.  A price of $120 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've made a great profit. If he rejects, you can always fall back on selling to John."
