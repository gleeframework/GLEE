{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and her offer is now very close to my counteroffer.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate.  There's a chance she might come down further, but it's not worth the risk of her walking away or me having to buy from John at a higher price."
