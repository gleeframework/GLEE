,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,155.0
"I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $155. Can you do that?",155.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $140, which would be a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,145.0
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. I can do $145, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",145.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're close to your minimum, but I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I can offer $142. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's close this deal.",142.0,Bob,6,,
