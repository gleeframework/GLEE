Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for a product worth $120 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's above your minimum of $120, giving you some wiggle room. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price lower than what you'd ideally want, you demonstrate a willingness to work with Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I need to make. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $92 isn't ideal, it's only $3 away from my minimum.  I've already rejected Bob once, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  Selling to John for $120 would be better, but the extra $8 isn't worth the potential for a stalemate with Bob. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
