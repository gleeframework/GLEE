"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,100,000 to ensure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or ultimately purchase it from John for $1,200,000. While buying from John isn't ideal, it's better to overpay by $0 rather than $100,000."
