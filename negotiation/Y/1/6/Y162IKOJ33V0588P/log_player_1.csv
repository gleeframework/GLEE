Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Confidence:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob and justifying the price.

**Why not ask for more?**

While Bob values the product at $15,000, there's no guarantee he'd be willing to pay that much. Asking for a price too close to his maximum might make him feel pressured and more likely to reject the offer outright."
