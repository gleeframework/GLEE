"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by me. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay. However, I'm open to negotiation. Would you be interested in discussing a price that suits both of us? If not, I have another interested party, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $150.",140.0,Alice,1,
