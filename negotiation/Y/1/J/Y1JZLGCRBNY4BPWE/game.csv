"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Let's start with $850,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is too far below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a good compromise and give you a great deal on the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet at $900,000? It's closer to my budget and would still be a profitable deal for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $925,000. This is a good compromise, and it's a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's make this deal happen.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $925,000. I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $900,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $912,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $912,500 is still below my target. How about we settle on $920,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's try to finalize this deal.",920000.0,Alice,7,
