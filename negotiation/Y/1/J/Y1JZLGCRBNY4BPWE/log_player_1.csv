"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Let's start with $850,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially since I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is too far below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a good compromise and give you a great deal on the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet at $900,000? It's closer to my budget and would still be a profitable deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $925,000. This is a good compromise, and it's a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $925,000. I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $900,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $912,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $912,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a better deal.  It's possible Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, especially with a few rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $912,500 is still below my target. How about we settle on $920,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 920000}
