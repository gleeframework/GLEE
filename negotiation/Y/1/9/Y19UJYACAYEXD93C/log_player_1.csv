Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as Backup:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything below $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale at a high price point."
