"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
