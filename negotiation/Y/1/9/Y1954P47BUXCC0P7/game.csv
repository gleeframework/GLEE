"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750000 is a good starting point, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, reflecting your interest and acknowledging that this is a unique opportunity.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $800000.  I believe this reflects the value of the product and shows my serious commitment to closing this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
