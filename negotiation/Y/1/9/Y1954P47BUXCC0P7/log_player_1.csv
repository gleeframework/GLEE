"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a high starting price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 

I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's still closer to my minimum acceptable value than John's offer.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. I have 9 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting your interest and acknowledging that this is a unique opportunity.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $800000.  I believe this reflects the value of the product and shows my serious commitment to closing this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price and matches what John is offering. Since I'm trying to maximize my earnings, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds, I'll accept his offer."
