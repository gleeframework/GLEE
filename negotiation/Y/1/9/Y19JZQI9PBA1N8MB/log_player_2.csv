"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $900,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from my initial offer. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $800,000.  While it's a reduction from the initial offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
