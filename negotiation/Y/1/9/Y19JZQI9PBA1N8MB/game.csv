"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $900,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from my initial offer. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
