{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counter. It also gives me the opportunity to see if he's truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I can't accept such a low price. I will counter with a higher offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $850,000, so I'll offer $825,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and it's worth closing the deal rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a higher price."
