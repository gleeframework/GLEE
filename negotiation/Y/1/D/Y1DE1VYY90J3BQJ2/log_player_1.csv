Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the Minimum:** I know I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so that's my absolute floor.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $22,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob counters, there's a good chance we can settle on a price that's still very profitable for me, potentially above $15,000.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
