Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a premium price of $20,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe its value will become clear to you.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to limit ourselves. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification for Premium:** By positioning the product as a ""premium"" opportunity, we aim to create a sense of exclusivity and higher perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to discuss the price, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above $15,000. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has a strong fallback option with John at $15,000. This allows her to negotiate from a position of strength."
