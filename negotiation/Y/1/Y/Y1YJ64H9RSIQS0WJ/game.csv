"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my maximum budget is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,3,

This is my final counteroffer. Let me know if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
