Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The goal is to get Bob to accept an offer as close to $1,500,000 as possible without him rejecting it. We need to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob refusing.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. I'm offering it at a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** We start near your minimum acceptable price to anchor the negotiation high.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlight the ""unique value"" to subtly justify the high price.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:**  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have room to go down slightly, but don't go below $1,500,000.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  John is your safety net, ensuring you don't have to settle for less than your minimum."
