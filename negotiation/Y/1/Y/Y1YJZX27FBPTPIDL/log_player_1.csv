Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  This doesn't necessarily mean he'd pay that much, but it sets an upper limit.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** ""Exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" frame the product positively.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is a significant markup, but not outrageous considering Bob's valuation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Expected:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but always keep your $800,000 safety net in mind.
* **Relationship Matters:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust your offer slightly lower to ensure a positive outcome for both parties."
