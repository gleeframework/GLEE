"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get it lower. He's willing to risk a few rounds to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  While Alice's offer is closer to his desired price, he's still willing to try for a lower price. He's confident he can get it down to $10,750 or even $10,500 in the next round.  There's still a chance for a deal within his budget, so he'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm offering $10,750 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best possible deal.  Alice's offer is still too high for him, and he's not ready to give up yet. He's willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if he can get the price down to his target range. He's also aware of the option to buy from John, which gives him a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it's within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final concession, and I expect you to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is approaching Bob's upper limit:**  $11,250 is close to Bob's maximum willingness to pay. 
* **Alice is firm:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Further negotiation might not yield a better price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance Alice might walk away.  
* **John's offer is a backup:**  Bob still has the option to buy from John if he's unhappy with the final price. 

While Bob would prefer a lower price, accepting this offer secures a good deal within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
