{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,200,000 is a price that is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving me a substantial profit. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob while also highlighting the potential return on investment for myself. 

This offer creates a potential for negotiation, and I'm prepared to counter any offer Bob might make to secure a deal as close to my desired price as possible. However, I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price of $1,500,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price than his initial valuation, $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation. I believe I can secure a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but still keeps the price substantially above Bob's initial offer.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while also emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of the proposed price. I'm using persuasive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still securing a price that allows me to achieve my desired outcome. I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to significantly drop below my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm thinking $1,050,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly diminishes my profit margin.  

I will reject his offer and continue to negotiate.  I believe that with a strategic counteroffer, I can secure a deal closer to my target price without having to sell to John for my minimum price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but $1,050,000 is still unfortunately below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference one last time.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $1,025,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,025,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to compromise any further and risk losing a significant portion of my potential profit.  

Given that John is willing to purchase the product for my desired price, I'll choose to sell the product to John.  It's a win-win situation, as I'll achieve my desired outcome, and John will acquire the product at a price that aligns with his budget."
