"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. How about we meet at $98? I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $98 is a reasonable compromise. It's more than John is offering, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result."
