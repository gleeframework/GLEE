"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $12,000, which is above Bob's limit. 
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. 
* There are still 9 rounds left, so there's plenty of room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he should start with a significant counteroffer. 
* Offering $9,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price of $12,000, but it's still within Bob's budget.
* This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price, but not an unreasonable one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,500 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
*  While it's closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price down to his limit.
* It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down to Bob's price or a price closer to it. 
* There are still 7 rounds remaining, which gives Bob enough time to potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to buy the product for $10,000 or less. 
* Alice's offer of $10,500 is too high. 
* Offering $9,500 is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about negotiating but still wants a good deal.
* This offer is a fair middle ground between Bob's initial offer of $9,000 and Alice's latest offer of $10,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $10,200, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
*  Even though it's only $200 above, Bob should aim to get the price down to his limit.
* It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down to Bob's price. 
* There are still 5 rounds remaining, which gives Bob enough time to potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to buy the product for $10,000 or less. 
* Alice's offer of $10,200 is only slightly above his budget.
* Offering $10,000 is Bob's maximum price and shows that he is firm in his budget. 
* This offer is a final attempt to reach a compromise and close the deal.
* If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will be ready to move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,100 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* Bob has already made several counteroffers, and Alice has consistently rejected them.
* There are only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to Bob's price in that time.
* It's better to buy the product from John for $10,000, as it's a guaranteed deal that meets Bob's budget."
