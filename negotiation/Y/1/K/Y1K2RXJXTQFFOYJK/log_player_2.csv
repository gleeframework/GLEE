# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially when you have a fallback option like buying from John.  We don't know Alice's minimum selling price, so there's a chance we can get it for less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. What are your thoughts?

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further. We can likely get the price lower than $1,400,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower than $1400000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now offering a price that's only $150,000 more than our initial counteroffer. It's a good deal considering we can always buy from John for $1,500,000. Accepting this offer will save us $150,000."
