Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be really happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
