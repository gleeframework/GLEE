"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, but I'm very interested in the product.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but $110 is still a little too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which is $102.50. It's the best I can do.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"It seems like we're getting closer, Alice.  How about $98 and we have a deal?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $98. I'll make one more counteroffer: $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,7,
