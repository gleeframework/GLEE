"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit too high for me, but I'm definitely interested in the product. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise considering the value this product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could we settle somewhere around $1,000,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
