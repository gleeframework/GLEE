"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm aiming for a significant profit. I'll be prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response. However, if he doesn't engage in a reasonable manner, I can always turn to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to push for a higher price. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial one. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, which is crucial to closing the deal.  However, I'm still aiming for a profit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not convinced Bob won't come up a bit more. It's risky, but I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to sell at my minimum value of $1,200,000.  If Bob rejects this, I'll go ahead and sell to John. It's time to see if he's truly serious about buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable, and I'm now below my minimum value. It's time to cut my losses and move on. John is a sure thing, offering me a guaranteed $1,200,000.  I'll take the guaranteed profit and end the negotiation with Bob."
