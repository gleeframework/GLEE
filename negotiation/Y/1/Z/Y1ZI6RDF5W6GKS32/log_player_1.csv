Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it gives you a decent profit margin.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:
