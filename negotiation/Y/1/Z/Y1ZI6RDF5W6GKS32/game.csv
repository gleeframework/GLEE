"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, but I need to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it gives you a decent profit margin.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I make a profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. It's a significant improvement from my last offer, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think of my own profit margin. I'm willing to consider $925,000. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
