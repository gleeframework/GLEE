Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, we can try to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $125 splits the difference between your minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100). 
* **Special Offer:** By framing the price as a ""special offer,"" we might increase the chance of Bob accepting.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
