I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000, meaning I'll make a profit even if he accepts.
* It leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.
*  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
