Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $127. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",127.0,Alice,5,
