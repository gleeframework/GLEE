"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the market value, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think!",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7750. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $7750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you say?",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point about splitting the difference, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $7900? It's the closest I can get to my budget, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7900.0,Bob,6,
