"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate the description, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $130. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a little hesitant at $160.  How about we split the difference and go with $155?  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from John for $150.",155.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $155. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $157. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",157.0,Alice,5,
