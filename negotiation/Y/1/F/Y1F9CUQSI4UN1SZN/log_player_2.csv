Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good deal for me. I've saved a significant amount compared to John's price, and it's only $500 more than my initial counteroffer. It's time to accept the deal."
