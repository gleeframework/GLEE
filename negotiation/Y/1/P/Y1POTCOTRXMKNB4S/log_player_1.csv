Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob. Your goal is to capture as much of this as possible.

**The Offer**

You want to start high to give yourself room to negotiate down if needed, but not so high that Bob walks away immediately. Here's a balanced offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're not being overly aggressive, but you're clearly stating the product's value.
* **Strong Price Point:** $1,150,000 leaves you room to negotiate while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit. It also ensures you're well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't sound like an ultimatum. It leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, starting a dialogue.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still making a profit that's worthwhile over John's guaranteed offer."
