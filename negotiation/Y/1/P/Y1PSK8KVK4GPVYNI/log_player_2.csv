{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a good alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to come down.  This price is significantly less than her initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is still above my target price, and I want to see if I can get her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but still keeping it below my target price of $8,000.  I think this is a good compromise that Alice might be willing to accept."
