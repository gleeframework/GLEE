Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob counter-offers, Alice is likely to secure a price significantly higher than John's $8,000 offer."
