Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, this offer should be attractive to him while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is a decent amount, I can likely get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see this as a fair compromise, given that he's willing to pay $12,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'd like to get.  However, given the risk that he might keep lowering his offer, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  John's offer of $10,000 is a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirement."
