"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80 if possible. Would you consider lowering the price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $75, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $120.  I'll see if I can negotiate further with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $87 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left to see if I can get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, I'm really hoping to get closer to $90.  Let's compromise at $89.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to propose $88 as the price. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $88 is still below my ideal price of $120, it's getting very close to my minimum acceptable price and I'm running out of rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John at a lower price."
