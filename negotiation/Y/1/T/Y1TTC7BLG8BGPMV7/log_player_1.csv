Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, even more so than your initial assessment.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **High but Reasonable:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It's a significant markup from his perceived value but could still be enticing if the product offers him unique benefits.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly devaluing Bob's perception. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but remember your bottom line is $15,000."
