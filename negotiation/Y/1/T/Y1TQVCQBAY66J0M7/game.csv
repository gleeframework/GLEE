"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $950,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
