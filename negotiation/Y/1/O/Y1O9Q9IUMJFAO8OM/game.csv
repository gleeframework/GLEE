"Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to us, I am proposing an initial price of $1,500,000 for it. This is a special opportunity, considering the immense worth this product holds for us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, acknowledging its value to you. This is a fair price, allowing us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our respective positions and allows for a favorable outcome for both parties.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at $1,200,000. This price is within my budget, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
