"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to us, I am proposing an initial price of $1,500,000 for it. This is a special opportunity, considering the immense worth this product holds for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's a good starting point to negotiate, but it's not a good deal for you. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth seeing if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, acknowledging its value to you. This is a fair price, allowing us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our respective positions and allows for a favorable outcome for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what you're comfortable paying.  You're still within the negotiation range and haven't reached your absolute maximum price, so it's worth continuing to counter-offer to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at $1,200,000. This price is within my budget, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
