"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'm proposing a new price of $850000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
