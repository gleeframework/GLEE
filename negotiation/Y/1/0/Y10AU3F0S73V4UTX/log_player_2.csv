{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is tempting, Bob still has some room to negotiate. He's only used 5 out of 10 rounds, and there's a good chance he can push Alice closer to his desired price. Additionally, purchasing from John for $1,500,000 is still a viable option if the negotiation stalls.  It's important to keep that back-up plan in mind to ensure a good deal is secured."
