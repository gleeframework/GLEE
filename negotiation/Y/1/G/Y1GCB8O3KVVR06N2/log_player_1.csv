Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as much as I can while staying within the bounds of what Bob might be willing to pay.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup offer from John at $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.  I need to balance maximizing my profit with the risk of Bob walking away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $16,000. This is still above Bob's initial counter-offer, but closer to his perceived value. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I value the product highly.  It gives Bob room to negotiate further if he's willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $14,000. This is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and while it's still a bit lower than ideal, it's a reasonable compromise. Selling to Bob for $14,000 is better than selling to John for $15,000, as it means a slightly higher profit for me.  Additionally, if I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better price in the next round. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing him altogether."
