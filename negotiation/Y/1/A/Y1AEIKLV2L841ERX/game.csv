"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9000 is simply too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $11000? This would still be a good price for you and allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
