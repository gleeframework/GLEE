Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice needs to make at least $12,000 to equal selling to John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **The Negotiation Gap:** There's a $2,000 difference between what Bob is willing to pay and Alice's minimum acceptable price.

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice's best bet is to offer the product at a price slightly above Bob's valuation, aiming to capture some of the surplus value. Here's why:

* **Offering too high (e.g., $12,000):** Bob will definitely reject the offer, and Alice will get her minimum price from John.
* **Offering too low (e.g., $10,000):**  Alice misses out on potential profit.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  A price between $10,000 and $12,000 gives Bob a chance to buy at a price he finds reasonable while letting Alice earn more than her bottom line.

**Example Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Price:** $11,000 is a strong starting point. It gives Alice a $1,000 profit over her alternative and might be tempting enough for Bob.
* **The Message:** It's important to frame the offer positively.  By highlighting the product's value, Alice might persuade Bob.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. Alice won't get a chance to revise her offer if Bob rejects it."
