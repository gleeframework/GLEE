Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 5

""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some frustration, but I assure you I'm negotiating in good faith.  $1,000,000 is too significant a gap from where I value this. To move things along, let's try $1,750,000. This is a substantial compromise on my end."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but that price is still not feasible for me.  To be frank, I'm working with a maximum budget of $1,200,000. If we can make a deal around there, I'm ready to close. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his maximum budget is $1,200,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's highly unlikely we'll bridge the gap between his budget and our $1,500,000 minimum.  Selling to John guarantees us our desired outcome without further risk of prolonged negotiation."
