{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $110. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This will give me some room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to me, hoping it might encourage Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I believe I can't exceed $85 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still unable to go above $88 for the product. Would you consider meeting me at $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $88 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I consider the product's worth.  I'm not convinced I can get a better deal from Bob, so I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $100."
