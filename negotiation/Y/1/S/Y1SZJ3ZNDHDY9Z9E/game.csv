"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still unable to go above $88 for the product. Would you consider meeting me at $88?",88.0,Bob,4,
