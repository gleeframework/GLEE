You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still hoping to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

You have three options:

You're still willing to pay less than $95, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm going to offer you the product for $92.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

Alice has come down to $92.50, which is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $120.  It's time to accept the offer and get the product."
