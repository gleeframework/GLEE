"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties to collaborate. We're willing to extend this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal with some negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. To facilitate a successful negotiation, I propose a price of $825,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial positions and could lead to a beneficial outcome for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $825,000 is a good price, it's still a little more than Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his goal of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly and efficiently."", ""product_price"": 800000}
