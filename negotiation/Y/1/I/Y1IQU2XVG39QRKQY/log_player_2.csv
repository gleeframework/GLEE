Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but I'm getting closer to my goal. I'll counteroffer again."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, and it's not clear if we'll be able to negotiate further. It's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Alice."
