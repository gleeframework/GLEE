"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have 10 rounds to reach a deal, and John's offer of $1,500,000 is always a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, so it's not a bad deal. However, I'm not desperate for a quick sale. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next rounds. There's always the option to sell to John for the same amount, so there's no downside to continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by showing flexibility I can encourage Bob to increase his offer. I'm also considering that I have 8 rounds left and that John's offer is still a safe fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal. It's higher than John's offer, and I'm confident that I can't get much more from Bob in the remaining rounds. I'm also mindful of the time constraint â€“ it's better to secure a good deal now than to risk losing out completely."
