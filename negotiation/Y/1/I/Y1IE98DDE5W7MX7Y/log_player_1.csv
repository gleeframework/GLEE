"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going all the way to my minimum price ($15,000) right away to allow for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is $15,000 to you, but I'm only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There are still 9 rounds remaining. I can counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a backup option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer but still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that $13,000 is ""fair"" to both of us.
* **Clear offer:**  I present a specific counteroffer and avoid vague language.
* **Encourage acceptance:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product to me, I am still only willing to pay $10,000. Would you be able to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  He's sticking to $10,000, which is significantly less than my minimum.
* **More room for negotiation:**  There are still 6 rounds left, giving me time to continue negotiating.
* **John is still my backup:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 provides me with leverage.

I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss, so I'll continue to counteroffer in hopes of reaching a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not able to go that low. How about we split the difference?  $11,500 is a fair compromise. This allows us to both get a decent deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I highlight the ""fair compromise"" aspect to encourage acceptance.
* **Specific offer:**  I present a concrete price for consideration.
* **Direct approach:**  I ask a direct question to prompt a response from Bob.

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm also aware that time is ticking away. If this offer is rejected, I may need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to move past $10,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:**  We are down to 4 rounds, and Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge from $10,000.
* **Significant loss:**  Accepting $10,000 would mean losing $5,000, which is a considerable amount.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John's offer of $15,000 guarantees a profit and meets my minimum requirement.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a complete breakdown is too high. John's offer provides a secure and profitable outcome, so I'm choosing to sell to him."
