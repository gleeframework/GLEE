"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired maximum of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it's better to try and get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts by acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing interest, but then states a lower price that is still above Alice's value of $8,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $9,500 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $10,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $10,500 is below Bob's maximum of $12,000.
* **Alice's offer is fair:** Alice has already lowered her price from $11,000 to $10,500. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and this could risk losing the deal entirely.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to secure the product while staying within Bob's budget."
