Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a good starting point considering my minimum value of $120. This leaves room for negotiation but also shows that I'm confident in the value of the product.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for $90. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for a price that's too low. Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and make another counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price, but if it doesn't work out, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is my final compromise. It's still above my minimum value and shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's see if he finally bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 to ensure I get a fair price."
