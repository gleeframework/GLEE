"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point considering my minimum value for the product is $10,000. I'm hoping to get a higher price, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. $13,000 is still a bit low for me, and I think I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial price and closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be acceptable and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has increased his offer to $13,500.  This is a good compromise and closer to my desired price point. I will accept his offer to ensure a sale in this round and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
