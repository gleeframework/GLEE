"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the fact that I have another offer for $1,000,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,250,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value to me and my alternative offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
