"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget, and he has a backup option with John.  Rejecting allows Bob to start the negotiation process and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his maximum budget. He's better off continuing to negotiate with Alice or buying from John at his set price of $1,000,000."
