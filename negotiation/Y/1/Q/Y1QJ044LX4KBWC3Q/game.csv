,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product to me and gives you a considerable discount. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $725,000. I believe that represents a fair compromise for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $800,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the value the product holds for you. Let's close this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,
