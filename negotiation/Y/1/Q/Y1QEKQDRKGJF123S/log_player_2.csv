"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for a competitive price of $14,000. I think you'll find it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 isn't a terrible price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting high, knowing you have a walk-away price of $15,000.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's opening price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Professional:** The message keeps the tone positive and avoids being confrontational, which is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range.  Even if Alice rejects this offer outright, it gives us a starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 was a bit high, but I'm not comfortable with $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still not at a price I'm thrilled about.  A $1,000 concession from her initial offer is good, but it's worth seeing if I can get closer to $12,000 before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Reasonable:**  I'm being direct now about my target price of $12,000.  This is a fair price that still gives Alice a decent profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  While I'm stating my ideal price, I'm also using flexible language (""around $12,000"") to signal that I'm open to a slight compromise if needed. 
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  I'm continuing to be appreciative and respectful of Alice's time, which helps maintain a positive negotiation environment."
