Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly tone in my message to establish a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question to invite Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and risking a longer negotiation that might end with an even lower price."
