"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think it's worth less than that. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  The value this product brings is undeniable, and I'm confident it can exceed your initial assessment. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still believe that $1,450,000 is too high for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see some flexibility from your side.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your perspective and I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,375,000? This represents a significant concession on my part and lands us at a price point that I believe is mutually beneficial.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to see some more movement from your side.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
