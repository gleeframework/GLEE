Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think it's worth less than that. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a very competitive price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still believe that $1,450,000 is too high for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see some flexibility from your side.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

At this point, Bob is showing a willingness to move towards a price that's getting closer to our desired outcome. Accepting his offer of $1,325,000 is a good strategic move for the following reasons:

* **Significant Profit:** It still nets a substantial profit of $125,000 over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A deal in hand is worth more than the potential for a slightly higher offer in later rounds, especially as we are now past the halfway point in the negotiation. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to push Bob risks him walking away entirely, leaving us with John's offer which, while meeting our minimum, would mean missing out on potential profit."
