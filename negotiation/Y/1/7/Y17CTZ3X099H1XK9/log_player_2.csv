"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is closer to the value I place on the product ($1,000,000). Rejecting Alice's offer will allow me to save $100,000 compared to buying from John.
