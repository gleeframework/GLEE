"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, but I'm not budging further. I'm confident that the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to wait for a more serious offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, Alice. I'm still thinking that the product is worth less than that to me. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1050000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
