"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm confident the product is worth more than $12000 to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $14000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $8000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8000, and I'm still willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16500.0,Alice,5,
