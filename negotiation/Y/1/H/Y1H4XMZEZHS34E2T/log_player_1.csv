"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise and incentivize Bob to negotiate.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I have 9 more rounds, so I'm not under immediate pressure to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum.  I want to see if we can find a compromise closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering below my minimum, and I'm not feeling pressured to sell yet. I'll reject his offer again and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me at this point. If he doesn't, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,145,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,145,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob is not budging from his offer, and it's below my minimum acceptable price. I've got 4 rounds left, and while I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge, and I'm risking losing time. 

John is offering my minimum acceptable price, so it's a safer and quicker option for me to secure the deal."
