Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

We're still significantly above John's offer, and I believe there's room for Bob to come up further.  We'll keep applying pressure."

While we're still above John's offer, Bob seems firm in his valuation, and we're getting close to the point where squeezing further might backfire. Taking the $1,275,000 now is a solid win."
