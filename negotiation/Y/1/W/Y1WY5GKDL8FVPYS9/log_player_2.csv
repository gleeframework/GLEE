# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset for a price lower than its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible value for my product.  While I recognize its worth to you, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for significantly less than its value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
