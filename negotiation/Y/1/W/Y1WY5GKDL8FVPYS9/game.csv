"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset for a price lower than its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible value for my product.  While I recognize its worth to you, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for significantly less than its value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $925,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at that price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
