"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $14,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
