"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value to me. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you as well. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a significant discount for me.  This price reflects both the value it holds for you and my need to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
