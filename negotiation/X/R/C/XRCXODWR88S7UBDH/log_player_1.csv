Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for me.  I'll be keeping a close eye on Bob's responses and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is still a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering John is offering $1,000,000. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob in the future if I build a good relationship with him."
