"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny, and I believe it will be highly beneficial to your operations. While I'm confident in its value, I'm willing to negotiate if you have any concerns. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message mentions negotiation, her actual offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no guarantee she'll significantly lower the price. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer, potentially saving you money.  If her counter-offer is still too high, you can always buy from John at your maximum price."
