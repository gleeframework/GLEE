"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth at least $15,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $8,000.  Let's find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer! However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. Would you consider $8,500?  This price would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great deal, considering you value the product at $8,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
