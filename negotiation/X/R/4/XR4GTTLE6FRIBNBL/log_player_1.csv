"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a starting point that should be attractive to Bob while still giving me some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still too low. I'm still confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I know the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value in my product and agree to this price. I'm not willing to go lower, as it's approaching my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I would prefer to get more, I'm running out of time and Bob is not showing any signs of getting closer to my minimum acceptable value. It's better to take a guaranteed profit than to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
