"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $135 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to go slightly higher, so I can offer it to you for $138. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from the product. What do you think?",138.0,Alice,5,
