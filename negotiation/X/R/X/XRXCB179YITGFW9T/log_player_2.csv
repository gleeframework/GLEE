Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.

I'd like to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer.
