{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum price:** You're aiming to get more than $100.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him room to negotiate.
* **It includes a friendly opening message:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

By starting with this offer, you can see how Bob reacts and then adjust your strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $115?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $115 is below your minimum price of $100, but it is also above the offer from John. Therefore, it makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. You still have room to move up from $115, and it's possible you can get closer to your desired price of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $115 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $122.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $122.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $118? It's closer to your last offer, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $118 is still a bit below my ideal price, it's a good deal considering:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm getting more than the $100 John is offering.
* **It's close to Bob's perceived value:**  It's likely Bob won't offer much more.
* **It's a quick sale:** Further negotiation might drag on and risk a deal falling through. 

I'm willing to take the $118 to secure a quick sale and avoid potential risk of losing the deal entirely."
