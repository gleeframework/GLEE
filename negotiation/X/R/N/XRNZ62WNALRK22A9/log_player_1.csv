"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with an aggressive price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium right off the bat. 

It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price. This gives me leverage to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is just slightly above my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that small of a profit. I need to see if I can squeeze out more value.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher. I'm not desperate, and I have the option to sell to John if this negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for me to earn a profit. I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to pay a premium, but I'm also keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $1,300,000, which is a good price and a healthy profit for me. I don't want to risk pushing too hard and having him walk away. I'm confident I can close this deal and secure a good amount of money."
