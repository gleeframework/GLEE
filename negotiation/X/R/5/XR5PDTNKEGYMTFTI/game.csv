"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  This is a fair price that's good for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $940,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $915,000. That's as high as I can go.",915000.0,Bob,6,
