"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my goal, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  This is a fair price that's good for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $925,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price. I'm going to counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $940,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $915,000. That's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While I was hoping to get closer to my initial goal, the negotiations with Bob haven't been progressing as quickly as I'd hoped.  With John offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, it's a much better deal than risking further rounds of negotiation with Bob."
