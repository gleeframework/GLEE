"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but $140 is still a bit much for me. Could we possibly settle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
