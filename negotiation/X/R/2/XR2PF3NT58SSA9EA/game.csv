"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This price reflects the value we both recognize in this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
