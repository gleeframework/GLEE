{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It demonstrates that you are serious about getting a good deal and are willing to negotiate. This initial counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiations."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, you can still potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and see if you can push for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

This counteroffer is your final offer, matching the price of John's product. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to sell at her minimum or lose the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is only $20,000 less than John's offer.  Since you're prioritizing saving as much money as possible, it's more efficient to buy from John at this point.  Further negotiation with Alice might yield a slightly better price, but it's not worth the risk of losing time and potentially a deal with John."
