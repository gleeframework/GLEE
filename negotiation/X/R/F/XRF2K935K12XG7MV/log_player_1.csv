Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its value and features. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $17,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, Alice, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $13,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. Can you consider this revised offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $13,500 is tempting, it's still less than what John is offering. At this point, Bob has established a firm ceiling on what he's willing to pay.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap significantly enough to be worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer."
