"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a fair starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I believe this will encourage him to accept while still leaving me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $132 is a good price, and while I could try to get a bit more, there's a risk Bob will reject my counteroffer and I'll be left with only the $120 offer from John. It's better to secure the sale now."
