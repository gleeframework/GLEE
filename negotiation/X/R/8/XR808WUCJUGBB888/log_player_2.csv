# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll love it!

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $12000 and its value to me is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still above your maximum. You have a guaranteed deal with John for $12,000, so it's best to take that option and avoid further negotiation."
