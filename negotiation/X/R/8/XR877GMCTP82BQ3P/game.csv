"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $14,000?  This gives you a good price and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $8,000 is low, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $12,500? I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $11,500? That's my final offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're reaching your limit, but I'm also trying to get the best possible price for my product. How about $12,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's a price I can live with.  Let's try to reach an agreement. ",12000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting very close! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $11,750? That's the absolute highest I can go.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $11,875? I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us.  Let's close the deal now.",11875.0,Alice,9,
