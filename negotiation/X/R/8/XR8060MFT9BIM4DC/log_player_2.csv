# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $170 is way above your $120 limit. It's time to counteroffer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $170 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $155. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. You're still trying to get the price down to your $120 limit. It's best to reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still above my budget. I'm ready to pay $140 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $147.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $147.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $147.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you're nearing the end of your rounds.  Since you can get the product from John for $120, it's best to  stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John. You'll save yourself time and money."
