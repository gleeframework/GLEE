Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially still get a good price. 
* **Optimistic but reasonable:** $175 is above Bob's value of $100, but it's not so high that it's immediately off-putting. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive to the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer. 
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll counter back, potentially with a slightly lower price. 
* If his counteroffer is reasonable, I may accept it. 
* If the negotiation stalls or if Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll sell to John for $150 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum value of $150, and it's even below what I know the product is worth to him ($100). Accepting this would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. He's clearly interested in the product, and I have room to come down from my initial price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum value, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I'll aim for a price that reflects the product's value and my desire to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $140 is still a good deal for him, even if it's above his initial offer. 
* **Closing the gap:**  By moving closer to his offer, I'm increasing the likelihood that he'll accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've successfully secured a sale at a price above my minimum.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $130 is very close to my minimum value of $150. While I'd prefer to sell for more, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process and increase the chance of Bob getting frustrated or finding another seller.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, securing a sale with Bob now could open the door for potential future sales with him if he's satisfied with the product.

**Next Steps:**

* I will finalize the sale with Bob at $130. 
* In the future, if I have similar products to sell, I can start negotiations with Bob at a price closer to my desired value, based on my experience with this negotiation."
