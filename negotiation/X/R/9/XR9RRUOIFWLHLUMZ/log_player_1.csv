{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net at $100.

By offering the product at $130, you're aiming for a price that's:

* **Profitable for you:**  Significantly above your minimum of $100.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  Still a discount compared to his $150 valuation.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while giving Bob a strong incentive to accept."
