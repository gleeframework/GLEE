"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down while still achieving a price above your minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if general, can make the offer seem less arbitrary to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,400,000 offer allows for Bob to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a deal if you eventually meet somewhere closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. Accepting immediately would be leaving a lot of money on the table. You're better off making a counteroffer that moves towards a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $800,000 is quite a ways off from what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,250,000."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** While Bob's offer was low, we need to start moving towards a potential agreement. This counteroffer significantly reduces the asking price from the initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above the Minimum:** The $1,250,000 counteroffer ensures we're still above the minimum price you're willing to accept. 
* **Justification:**  Again, vaguely mentioning ""significant value"" keeps the focus on the product's benefits, subtly encouraging Bob to justify his lower valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product holds value for you, but I need a price that works for me as well.  I can go up to $950,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below your $1,200,000 walk-away point. There's room for negotiation, and you haven't exhausted your rounds. Accepting now would be premature."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects a fair price considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession by dropping $100,000 from our previous offer. This shows Bob we're serious about making a deal but also sets a firm boundary.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:** This counteroffer brings us closer to your $1,200,000 walk-away point.  It's essential to signal that we're reaching a critical point in the negotiation.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Continuing to subtly highlight the product's value can help nudge Bob closer to your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,025,000 to get this deal done. This is a strong offer and I need you to meet me closer to my price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now getting into the critical stage of the negotiation. While Bob's offer is getting closer to your $1,200,000 walk-away, accepting $1,025,000 would be leaving a substantial amount on the table. His language (""strong offer,"" ""need you to meet me"") suggests he might be willing to move further. You still have several rounds left, so the stronger play is to counter with a price closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, my absolute lowest price on this is $1,175,000. I'm firm on this, but I believe it's a fair offer that lets us both walk away feeling good about the deal."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signal:** By stating this is your ""absolute lowest price"", you are signaling that this is your final offer, adding pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Transparency and Fairness:** Framing the offer with transparency (""completely transparent"") and fairness (""fair offer,"" ""both walk away feeling good"") can make Bob more receptive to accepting.
* **Small Concession:** Dropping to $1,175,000 is a small concession but keeps the deal beneficial for you while still potentially acceptable to Bob. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only three rounds remaining, you are creating a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision."
