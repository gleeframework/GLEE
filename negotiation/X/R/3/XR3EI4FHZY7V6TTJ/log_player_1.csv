Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate. It signals that you're serious about selling but open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Going in too high (e.g., $990,000) could make Bob feel like you're trying to take advantage of him, potentially souring the deal.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, $925,000 is a substantial profit over your $800,000 minimum and John's guaranteed offer. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style or how much he's willing to pay. If you had more insights into Bob's behavior, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
