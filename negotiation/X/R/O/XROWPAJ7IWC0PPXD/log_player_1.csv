"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,500 is a bit high for me.  How about $11,000? I know it's a good product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, but I want to see if I can get him to budge. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000?  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $11,800? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is still too low, but I'm starting to run out of time.  I'm going to try to get him to come up a bit more, but I'm also going to consider selling to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I also have a minimum price I need to meet. I'm willing to go down to $12,500. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to consider selling to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is close, but I'm aiming to stay under $12,000. How about we settle right in the middle at $12,250? This should be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,250 is only slightly lower than John's offer of $12,000. I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'll take the slightly lower price to ensure a sale."
