"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,500 is a bit high for me.  How about $11,000? I know it's a good product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000?  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $11,800? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I also have a minimum price I need to meet. I'm willing to go down to $12,500. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to consider selling to another buyer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is close, but I'm aiming to stay under $12,000. How about we settle right in the middle at $12,250? This should be a fair compromise.",12250.0,Bob,6,
