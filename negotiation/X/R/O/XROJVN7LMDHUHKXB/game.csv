"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $5,000 is significantly below what I need to get for it. However, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price is still fair, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you be open to considering $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $6,500 is still quite low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
