"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. This represents a significant value proposition, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is appreciated, but it's higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $750000 is significantly below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, reflecting a fair compromise. This price still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject and he'll end up buying from John at the same price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at his maximum budget, minimizing the risk of losing out."
