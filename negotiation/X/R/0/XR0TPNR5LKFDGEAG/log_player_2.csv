"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity for your company to gain a significant advantage.  My asking price is $1,200,000. This reflects the value I've placed on the product and its potential for your business. I'm open to discussing the price further, but this is my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price of $800,000. There is a lot of room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to explore better terms."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a solid profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's meet in the middle on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point, but $1,050,000 is still too high.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with more rounds.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
