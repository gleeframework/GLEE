"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity for your company to gain a significant advantage.  My asking price is $1,200,000. This reflects the value I've placed on the product and its potential for your business. I'm open to discussing the price further, but this is my initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a solid profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's meet in the middle on this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
