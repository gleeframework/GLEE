Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a solid profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
