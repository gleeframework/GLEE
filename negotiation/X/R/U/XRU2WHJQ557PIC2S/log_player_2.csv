"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.

```

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point.
