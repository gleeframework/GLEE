"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was thinking, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $18000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to sell it to you for $15000. I can do $19000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000. That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at that price.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not ready to let you go just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $17500. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,7,
