Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, or if he'll counter with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $17,000. This is still higher than my minimum value, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him for $14,000."
