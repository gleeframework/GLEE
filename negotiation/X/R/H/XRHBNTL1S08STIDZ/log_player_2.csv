"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum budget, it's still a significant amount. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  I believe this price is still fair given the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's intention to negotiate. However, it's not so low that it's likely to be instantly rejected, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Focus on value:** Bob acknowledges the product's value, but emphasizes his desire to pay a price reflecting that value. This subtly reinforces the idea of a fair deal.
* **Open to compromise:** The message ends with a statement of willingness to compromise, signaling Bob's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation to try and get closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? This would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  This counteroffer offers a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her previous offer and Bob's last offer. It shows a genuine willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Reinforce fairness:** By using the phrase ""good deal,"" Bob reinforces the idea that this price is beneficial for both parties, making it more likely for Alice to accept.
* **Maintain pressure:**  While the counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there with $875,000.  Let's try $890,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to come to an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice has come down to $890,000, which is only $20,000 above Bob's ideal price of $875,000.
* **Risk of escalation:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a price closer to John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Time factor:**  Five rounds remain, and further negotiation might be time-consuming. Accepting this offer guarantees a deal at a reasonable price."
