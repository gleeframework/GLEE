"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. Can we consider that a fair price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $775,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
