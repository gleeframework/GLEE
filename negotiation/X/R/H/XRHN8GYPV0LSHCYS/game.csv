"Alice, I understand you want a good price, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000.
