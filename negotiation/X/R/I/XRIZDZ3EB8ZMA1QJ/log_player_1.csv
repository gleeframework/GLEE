"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a significant profit, but I'm also aware that I have the safety net of John's offer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of my product. I'm hoping this will lead to a quicker agreement, but I'm still prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum.  Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
