"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price from Alice.  You're better off rejecting this offer and seeing if she'll come down closer to her product's value of $10,000."
