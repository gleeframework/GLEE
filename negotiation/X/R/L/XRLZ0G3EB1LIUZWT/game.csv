"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer you the product for $22000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, this is my final offer.",22000.0,Alice,7,
