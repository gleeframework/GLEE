Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation by leaving some room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal, while still getting a price significantly higher than my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my fallback price with John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm at a price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this counteroffer is fair and leaves room for further negotiation."
