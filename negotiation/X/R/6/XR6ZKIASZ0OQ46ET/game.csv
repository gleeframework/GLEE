"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my current financial capacity.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  This price reflects the worth of the product while still acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. Let's compromise at $850,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
