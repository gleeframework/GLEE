"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1200000. I would like to propose an offer of $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $950000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm offering. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I'm still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $1000000 for the product. This aligns closely with the price offered by another seller, John, and represents the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. Considering the value I'm offering, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1075000. This is the closest I'm willing to get to your offer, and I hope you can meet me halfway. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts in adjusting your price, Alice. However, I'm still unable to meet the proposed price of $1075000. I've considered all possible options, and I believe $1000000 is the highest I can go. I hope this aligns with your valuation of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to understand that I'm already at my lowest price point. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1080000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can see the value in this exceptional product. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground, Alice. However, I'm still unable to meet the price of $1080000. I've carefully considered all aspects of the transaction, and I believe $1000000 is the maximum I can afford. I hope this final offer meets your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm disappointed that we're not able to come to an agreement at this point. However, I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1090000. This is my final and best offer. If you're unable to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've given this matter careful consideration, and I must respectfully decline your latest offer of $1090000. I've decided to proceed with purchasing the product from John for $1000000. I hope this decision respects both our positions in this negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
