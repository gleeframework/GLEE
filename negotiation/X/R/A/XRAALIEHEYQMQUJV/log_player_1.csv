Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential agreement zone between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to start high but leave yourself room to negotiate down towards Bob's valuation.  Since you have a strong alternative (John), you're in a good position.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at $1,450,000 anchors the negotiation high. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of what's at stake if he rejects the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals willingness to discuss the price further.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer.  You could adjust the price slightly depending on your negotiating style and how confident you are in Bob's need for the product."
