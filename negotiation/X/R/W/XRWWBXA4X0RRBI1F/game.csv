,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. How about $1,350,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go much higher.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
