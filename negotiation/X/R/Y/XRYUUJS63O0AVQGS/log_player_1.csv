{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $115 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $100, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $130.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $122.50 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $118.75?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my initial asking price of $130, it's getting closer to my target. Accepting his offer will secure a sale at a reasonable price and avoid further negotiation.  It's also important to remember that Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, which is the price I can get from John."
