Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is a good one, but $200 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I still think $170 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $145 for the product.
