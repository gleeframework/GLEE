"Hi Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $88? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $90? It's closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close the deal at this price.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $87? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",87.0,Bob,6,
