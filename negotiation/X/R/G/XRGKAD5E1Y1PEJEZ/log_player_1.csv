"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value ($120) than Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow me to gauge his true interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($120).**  Even though it's closer than his initial value, I'm not willing to sell for less than my floor price.
* **I want to see if I can push Bob higher.**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option.** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $120, which is a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using language that emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, making Bob more likely to feel positive about the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $92.50 is closer to my desired price, I'm leaving a small margin for Bob to counteroffer if he's still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $88? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's closer than before, it's not enough for me to accept.
* **Opportunity for a Higher Counteroffer:** I have a few more rounds left to negotiate, and I believe I can potentially push Bob to a higher price.  
* **John's Offer Remains:** Selling to John for $120 is still a safe option if negotiations with Bob break down.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $90? It's closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $90 is a reasonable middle ground between our current positions.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I reiterate the importance of a fair deal for both of us.  
* **Urgency:**  I subtly suggest closing the deal to increase pressure on Bob to accept.

I believe $90 is a good balance between pushing for a higher price and closing the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $87? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Short:** Bob's offer of $87 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $120. With only four rounds left, I'm unlikely to get him to agree to a price that's high enough.
* **Risk of Further Decline:** There's a high risk that if I reject this offer and make another counteroffer, Bob will either reject it or offer an even lower price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is my minimum acceptable price and provides a comfortable profit.  

While it's always tempting to try and squeeze out a bit more, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob and ending up with nothing is too high at this point. Selling to John provides a secure and profitable outcome."
