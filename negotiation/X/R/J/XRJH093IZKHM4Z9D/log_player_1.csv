Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, Bob landing at my minimum acceptable price means it's time to take the deal. There's no guarantee I can get more out of him, and risking the sure $1,000,000 isn't worth it in this case."
