"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you will easily justify the cost. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is fair for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price is still fair and reflects the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  However, $1,100,000 remains above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it while still ensuring a fair profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can do better. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I have several rounds left to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than the value this product holds for you.  To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm prepared to drop the price to $1,050,000.  This price is a fair middle ground that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. To demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work, I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $1,025,000, which is only $25,000 away from my minimum.  With only 4 rounds left, there's a good chance we won't reach a higher price.  It's better to accept this offer than risk losing him completely."
