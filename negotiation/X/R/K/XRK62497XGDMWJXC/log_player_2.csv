"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you will easily justify the cost. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's tempting to accept, I can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is fair for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showcasing my serious intent to negotiate.

* **Mutual benefit:** Emphasizing ""mutually beneficial"" reinforces that this is a win-win situation. 
* **Next steps:**  I'm confident that this counteroffer will either be accepted by Alice or lead to further productive negotiations."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price is still fair and reflects the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than the value this product holds for you.
