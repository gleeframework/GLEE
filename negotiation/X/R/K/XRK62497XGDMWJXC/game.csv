"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you will easily justify the cost. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is fair for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price is still fair and reflects the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  However, $1,100,000 remains above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it while still ensuring a fair profit for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than the value this product holds for you.  To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm prepared to drop the price to $1,050,000.  This price is a fair middle ground that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. To demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work, I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
