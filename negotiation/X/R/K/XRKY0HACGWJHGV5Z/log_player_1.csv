Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This would allow me to make a fair deal, and you'd still be getting a great price."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I am still unable to go above $10,000 for the product. I appreciate your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly fixed on his $10,000 valuation and doesn't seem open to moving significantly.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and I'm better off taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
