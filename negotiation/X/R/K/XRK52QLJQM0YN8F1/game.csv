"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $8,000. Would you be open to negotiating a price closer to that range?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $12,000 is still quite a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $9,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, $9,000 is still below my target. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to meet my minimum value. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to offer a final price of $10,000. This is a substantial amount, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're not able to accept this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to meet my minimum value. I can offer you a price of $14,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping you can see the value in the product at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
