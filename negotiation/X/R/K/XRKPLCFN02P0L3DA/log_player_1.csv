{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $14,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $13,000 is still too low, especially since he's willing to pay $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $13,800? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still leaves plenty of room for you to get a great value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,800 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for $13,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us both walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,500. While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, this is a good deal and ensures I make a profit while also keeping Bob happy.  It's better than risking going through more rounds and potentially ending up with nothing."
