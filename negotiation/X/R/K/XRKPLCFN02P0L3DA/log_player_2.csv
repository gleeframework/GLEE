"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's below his maximum, there's room for negotiation to save even more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $14,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $13,800? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still leaves plenty of room for you to get a great value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While it is a better price than the first offer, there's still room for negotiation to get it closer to his target. He should try to counteroffer again to see if he can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,800 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for $13,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
