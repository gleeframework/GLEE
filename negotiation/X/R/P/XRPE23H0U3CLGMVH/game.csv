"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering $775,000. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept while still making a decent profit.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $775,000 is getting close, but it's still a touch more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm counteroffering $800,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,7,
