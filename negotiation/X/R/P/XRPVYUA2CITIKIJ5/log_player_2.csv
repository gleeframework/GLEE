(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John. You've reached the end of the negotiation with Alice, and it's clear she won't go lower than $110.  This is above your budget, and while you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next offer and you'll have no choice but to buy from John.  Since John is offering the product at your desired price, it's the best option to guarantee you get the product for the price you want."
