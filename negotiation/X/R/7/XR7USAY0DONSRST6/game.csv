"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price still allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $1,250,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still significantly below what I need to consider. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a reasonable price while ensuring I receive a fair value for it. Let's try to finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
