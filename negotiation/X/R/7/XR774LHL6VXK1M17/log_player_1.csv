"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm using a high price as a starting point. This allows for potential negotiation and hopefully, a good outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not willing to accept it. I will try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm willing to lower my price to my absolute minimum to keep the negotiations going. This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to come closer to my desired price without pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can push for a better deal, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price slightly, hoping to bridge the gap with Bob.  It's a compromise, but still allows me to earn a substantial amount. This should encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price without risking him walking away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I want to maximize my profit, I'm running out of time. With only four rounds left, and Bob's offers consistently lower than my minimum, I don't believe I can close a deal with him at a satisfactory price.  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than risking further negotiations and ending up with an unfavorable outcome."
