{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down while still making a significant profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I mention the product's value to highlight its worth and justify the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing that I'm open to negotiation. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation on favorable terms while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, it's still higher than my floor price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject this offer because:

* **Room for Improvement:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. He clearly recognizes the product's value and is willing to pay a significant amount.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially drive a better deal.

In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to my desired price point, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, I'm not comfortable with your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident that this offer is still beneficial to you, considering your stated value of the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by reducing my initial price.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and how my offer still provides him with a good deal. 
* **Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence that my offer is beneficial to Bob, reinforcing his perceived value of the product.

This strategy aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired price while maintaining a positive and constructive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Even though there's potential to negotiate further, I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Guaranteed Value:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired price. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could be time-consuming and may not result in a better offer. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's always the risk that Bob will continue to lower his offers, and I may end up with a worse outcome than selling to John.

By selling to John, I'm securing a known and acceptable price, eliminating the uncertainty and potential for a worse outcome."
