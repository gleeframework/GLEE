"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $90, my goal is to get as close to my minimum price as possible, and $90 is still below that. I have a few more rounds to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? That's as low as I'm comfortable going, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not there yet. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  But I'm not comfortable dropping below $90 at this point.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable paying $90. Would you be willing to go down to $87? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $87, I'm still holding out hope for a better price. I'm only a few rounds away from having to sell to John, so I have a little room to maneuver."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $89. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 89}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable paying $89. Would you be willing to go down to $84? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're down to the last few rounds, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, $100 is a good deal, and it guarantees I won't lose money."
