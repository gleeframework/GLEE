Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, though, and I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, as I've already got another deal lined up for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario, allowing me to acquire the product while still giving you a profitable deal.  Let's make this happen.
