"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product, but I have to make a living, so I'm going to have to make a fair offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her valuation, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $1,000,000.  You can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
