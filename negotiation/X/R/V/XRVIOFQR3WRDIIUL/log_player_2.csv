# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I believe it's worth $15,000 to you, and to make this a worthwhile transaction for both of us, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Alice's offer is still considerably higher than John's fallback price. There's room to negotiate or wait for a better offer from Alice."
