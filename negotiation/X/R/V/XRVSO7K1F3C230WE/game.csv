"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $180 might have been a bit ambitious, I can't go as low as $80.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, $130 is still a bit much for me. How about we try $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some real interest from other buyers, and to be honest, $95 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about $115, and we close this deal?",115.0,Alice,5,
