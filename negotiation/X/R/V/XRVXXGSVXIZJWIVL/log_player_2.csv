"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $15,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($8,000) and what John is offering ($8,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is bad, Alice indicates she's open to discussion. Rejecting this offer gives you a chance to negotiate a better price.
* **Backup option:** You have a guaranteed backup option with John at a price that fits your budget."
