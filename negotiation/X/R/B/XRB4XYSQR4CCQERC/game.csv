"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential benefits for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to the mark, I need to get at least $14,000 for this. It's my final offer -  I'm confident you won't find this value anywhere else.",14000.0,Alice,5,
