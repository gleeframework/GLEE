"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  While $9000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $8750.  Would you be open to that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $9000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll give you a 1-year warranty on the product, which is a $500 value, absolutely free. So, the total value you'll get is $9500, but you'll only pay $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the warranty, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product, including the warranty. This offer is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this point. Let me know what you think.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'll sell the product to you for $9000, but I'll also throw in a second warranty, a 2-year warranty, which is a $1000 value, absolutely free. This is the best deal I can offer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
