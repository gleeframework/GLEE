{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $1,400,000 but still above Bob's absolute maximum of $1,200,000. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to potentially secure a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,380,000 is still above Bob's ideal price but lower than John's price of $1,200,000.  It's likely that Alice will not come down much further. Accepting the offer means Bob saves $20,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous option in this scenario."
