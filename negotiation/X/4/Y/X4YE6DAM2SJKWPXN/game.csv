"Alice, $20000 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8000 for this product. Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $17000 to make this worthwhile. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's keep the conversation going.",17000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $12000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need at least $14000 for this deal to be worthwhile.  Let's be realistic, this product holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13000 is still below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $13500.  This is a fair compromise given the value of the product and your budget.  Let's finalize this deal now.",13500.0,Alice,7,
