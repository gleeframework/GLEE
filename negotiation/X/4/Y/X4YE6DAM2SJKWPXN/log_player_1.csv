Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8000 for this product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $17,000 to make this worthwhile. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000. Let's meet halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $12,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need at least $14,000 for this deal to be worthwhile.  Let's be realistic, this product holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the deal.  I'm willing to go another round with Bob, but I'll need to see a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $13,500.  This is a fair compromise given the value of the product and your budget.  Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can go up to $13250. This is my final offer. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $13,250 is close to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally want. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob - it's almost the end of our rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower offer. Selling to John for $15,000 ensures a secure profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
