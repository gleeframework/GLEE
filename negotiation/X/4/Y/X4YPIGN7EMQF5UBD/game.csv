"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $95.  How about we settle at $90? That seems like a fair compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50? That would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
