"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is a bit outside my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,500, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to move the deal forward, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,5,
