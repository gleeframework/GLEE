"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit high for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $9500. This would still be a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a middle ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference at $10000? This would allow both of us to walk away happy with the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
