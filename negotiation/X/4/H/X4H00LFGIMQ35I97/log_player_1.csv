Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a better deal if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you believe the product is worth more and are offering it at a ""discount,"" you create a sense of value.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob. Knowing you have other options weakens your negotiating position. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
