"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  He has a clear maximum price of $150, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, but Alice is closer to her minimum price.  There's still room to negotiate further.  Bob should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his desired $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. $135 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $130?  That way we can both get a good deal and move forward with this."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $135. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I'll meet you at $132.50. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is very close to his maximum price, and Alice is getting closer to her minimum.  While it's still possible to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further.  The offer of $132.50 is a good compromise and a fair price for both parties.  Accepting it allows Bob to buy the product for a reasonable price without risking losing the deal."
