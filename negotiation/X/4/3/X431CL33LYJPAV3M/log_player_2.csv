"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still potentially save more.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and see if he can get an even better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I still think our product is worth more than $10,750. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is only $100 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $10,750.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and Bob is saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's good for him, without risking further negotiation that might lead to a stalemate."
