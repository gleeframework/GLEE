"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than John's price. I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $6,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's still worth negotiating further. I'll reject this offer and counter with something closer to her perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the compromise, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to the price I'm willing to accept. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $7,800. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her best offer, but it's still above my target price and potentially above her value. I'll push back one more time to test her resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need it to work for me.  Would you consider $7,200? If not, I think I'll have to go with a different seller."",
""product_price"": 7200
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $7,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $7,500. This is the final price I can accept, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
