"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might incentivize her to propose a lower price, closer to her $10,000 valuation. Even if she doesn't budge, you're not losing anything by rejecting and moving to John."
