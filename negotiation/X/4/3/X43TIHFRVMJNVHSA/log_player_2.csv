"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated and my own assessment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,200,000. This is my best offer and reflects the immense value this product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than you'd like to pay, even though it's come down a bit. 
* You're still aiming to save as much as possible, and you have more rounds left to negotiate. 
* Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still outside of my comfortable price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the potential of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
