"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is significantly below the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects a substantial discount while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. I believe this is a good compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $975000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $975000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it reflects the value you will receive from the product. I hope we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
