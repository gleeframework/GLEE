"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $13500? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $13,500 is less than the $15,000 Bob would pay John.
* **Further negotiation might not be fruitful:** Alice has already compromised, and further bargaining may lead to a stalemate or even a rejection, forcing Bob to buy from John.
* **Meeting halfway is a fair compromise:**  Alice's offer is halfway between Bob's initial counteroffer of $13,000 and her previous offer of $14,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob to get the product at a lower price than John's."
