Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $850,000. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is firm at $850,000, and it's unlikely she'll go lower.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no point in trying to haggle further with Alice."
