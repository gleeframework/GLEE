"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. But $1,150,000 is still below my bottom line. I'm willing to offer a final compromise of $1,175,000.  This is my last offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
