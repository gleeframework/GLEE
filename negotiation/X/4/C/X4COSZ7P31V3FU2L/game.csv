"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm going to come down to $1,200,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
