"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has great potential for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $2,000,000 is above my minimum, but not outrageously high. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  Mentioning the product's potential is a subtle way to suggest its value without revealing my own valuation. 
* **Engaging Bob:**  Asking for his opinion encourages a response and starts the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you consider accepting a counteroffer of $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, but I have room to negotiate. 
* **Potential for a better price:**  Bob acknowledges the product's value and is clearly interested. There's potential for a higher counteroffer. 
* **Leveraging the negotiation:**  By rejecting, I can signal that I'm not desperate and push for a higher price. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,750,000? It's still a significant value for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial price, showing I'm willing to compromise.  
* **Highlighting value:**  Again, I emphasize the product's value to Bob to reinforce the potential benefits.
* **Flexibility:**  The mention of ""finding a solution that works for us both"" further emphasizes my willingness to negotiate.
* **No immediate threat:**  I avoid mentioning selling to John, as I want to see if Bob will come closer to my preferred price before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Given my current financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell yet. I believe there's still room for a higher price.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  I'm optimistic that I can push him a little higher.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Selling to John would guarantee the minimum, but I'm willing to risk another round for a better price.

I'll counter with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and $1,600,000 is a good offer. However, I'm still a little short of my target price.  Would you consider $1,650,000? This would allow me to make this deal work and still give you a fantastic opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:**  I'm increasing the price slightly to show I'm not easily swayed. 
* **Highlighting benefit:**  I emphasize the ""fantastic opportunity"" to remind Bob of the product's value.
* **Finding a compromise:**  This price is a reasonable middle ground, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **No mention of John:** I'm keeping the focus on Bob and trying to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I am willing to go up to $1625000 for your product. I hope this offer is acceptable and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  There's not much more room for negotiation, and further rounds might risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, accepting this offer is a wise move.
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  Even if I reject, there's no guarantee of a better offer in the remaining rounds.  

Accepting this offer secures a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal to John or further negotiation failing."
