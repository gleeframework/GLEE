Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a good deal for me. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer is still a good deal for him, saving him $75,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise."
