"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I'm hoping to acquire it for a slightly lower price.  Given the value to me, I'm prepared to offer $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a good deal for me. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
