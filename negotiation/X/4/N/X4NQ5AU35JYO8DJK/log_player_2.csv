Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can only go down to $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $105 is within your budget of $120. It's a good deal, and you don't want to risk losing the opportunity by rejecting and potentially getting a worse price."
