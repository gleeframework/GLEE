Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** The range where a deal can happen is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away.  There are a few approaches:

1. **Aggressive Opening:** Start near your bottom line ($1,500,000) to signal the product's value. This leaves less room for negotiation but might intimidate Bob.
2. **Moderate Opening:**  Choose a price within the ZOPA, like $1,400,000. This shows willingness to negotiate.
3. **Information Gathering:** Instead of a firm price, open with a question to gauge Bob's interest and budget (""What would you consider a fair price for this product?""). This can provide valuable information but risks appearing uncertain.

**The Offer (Moderate Approach)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe its true value is significant, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by emphasizing the product's value.
* **Reasonable Price:** The $1,400,000 price leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still being a significant gain for you.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (without lying about John) creates urgency for Bob to act.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start higher. 
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship is important, a fairer approach might be better.

This is just one approach, and the optimal strategy depends on the nuances of your relationship with Bob and your negotiation style."
