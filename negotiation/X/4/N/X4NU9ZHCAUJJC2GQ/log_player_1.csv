I'll reject Bob's offer. $13,000 is too low, and I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll try to negotiate further."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not sure I can get a better price, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might lose interest."
