This is a good time to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling a limit:** Her message suggests she's nearing her lowest acceptable price.
* **The price is reasonable:**  $82 is a decent saving from both your initial maximum and John's offer. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:** You might be able to get it slightly lower, but you risk Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at $100."
