Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,450,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This price is still fair considering the value you place on it and allows for a healthy profit for you.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This allows me a fair profit while still offering you a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This price is a fair compromise, as it allows you to make a substantial profit while also giving me a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.

While Bob is moving in the right direction, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a result that's significantly better than John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
