Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is too low, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  I believe this product will really benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $115? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $115, and it's her ""final offer.""  While we could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of missing out on a guaranteed price of $100 from John."
