"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I know it's a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects that while still allowing for a fair profit for me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price. He has a clear advantage in this negotiation, as he knows Alice's minimum selling price.  By rejecting and counteroffering, Bob can try to secure a lower price closer to Alice's $800,000 valuation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000.  This still allows you to acquire a valuable product at a competitive price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better price. He's willing to pay $850,000 and knows Alice is willing to sell for $800,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should attempt to get a price closer to his desired $850,000."
