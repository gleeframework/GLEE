"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I know it's a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects that while still allowing for a fair profit for me.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while getting me a great price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000.  This still allows you to acquire a valuable product at a competitive price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $875,000 for the product. This gives you a solid profit while still saving me some money compared to your last offer.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
