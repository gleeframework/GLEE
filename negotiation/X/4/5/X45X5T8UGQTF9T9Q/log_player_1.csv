I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my $9,000 target.  I have a few more rounds to work with, so I'll see if I can push for a higher price."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my target than John's offer and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal completely."
