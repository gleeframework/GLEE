Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price. I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $1,250,000.  This is still above Bob's offer but it's closer to his perceived value and my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for him to agree."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to earn more, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely.  I'm going to accept his offer and finalize the sale."
