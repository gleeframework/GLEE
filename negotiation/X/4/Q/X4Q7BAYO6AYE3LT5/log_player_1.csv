Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:**  You know the product is worth $120 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($100).
* **Aim high, but be reasonable:** Starting with an offer of $115 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Don't be greedy:** While you could try for a higher price, getting closer to $120 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. A $115 sale price ensures a good profit and a higher likelihood of closing the deal with Bob, who you know values the product. 
* **The John backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides you with a safety net. This knowledge allows you to confidently aim for a higher price with Bob."
