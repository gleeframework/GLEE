"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum price. To move this forward, I can go down to $875,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that still allows you to benefit greatly."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $875,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and employing negotiation tactics to try and get the best price.  We're getting closer to my minimum, but I still have room to negotiate and try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  While $787,500 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. Could we meet in the middle at $830,000? This allows me to feel comfortable with the deal while still offering you a significant discount compared to its actual value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come up a bit, how about $805,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $805,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $805,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $805,000 is above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and provides a reasonable profit. While I could push for more, there's always the risk that Bob walks away. This offer represents a solid deal."
