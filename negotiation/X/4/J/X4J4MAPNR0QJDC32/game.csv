"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I think you'll find this a fair offer considering the potential return on your investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum price. To move this forward, I can go down to $875,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that still allows you to benefit greatly.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $875,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  While $787,500 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. Could we meet in the middle at $830,000? This allows me to feel comfortable with the deal while still offering you a significant discount compared to its actual value.",830000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come up a bit, how about $805,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",805000.0,Bob,6,
