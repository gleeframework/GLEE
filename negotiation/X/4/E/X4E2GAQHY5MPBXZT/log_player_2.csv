{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but wants to stay within his budget. Offering $12,000 is a strong counteroffer that demonstrates his commitment to buying the product while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still aiming for a lower price.  There's a chance Alice will come down further, and rejecting the offer keeps those negotiations open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his original goal of getting the price down to $12,000, but he's willing to compromise slightly. $12,500 is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing his commitment to reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and there's a risk of her becoming more stubborn.  At this point, accepting the offer for $13,500 is a reasonable compromise, allowing Bob to acquire the product while staying within his budget.  There's no guarantee that further negotiations will yield a significantly lower price, and there's the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
