"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a perfect fit for you. It's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price slightly above my minimum threshold. Would you be interested in acquiring it for $810,000? This gives us both a good deal, and ensures I can provide you with excellent support after the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is offering the product for $10,000 more than John. While she mentions support, there's no guarantee this support is worth the extra cost. You can get the product at its fair market value from John."
