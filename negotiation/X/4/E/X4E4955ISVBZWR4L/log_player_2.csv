"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This extraordinary item holds immense value to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you, given its worth of $800,000 to you. I am offering you the chance to own this masterpiece at a price that reflects its true essence and significance. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $950,000. This offer not only ensures you secure an asset that is highly sought after but also allows me to appreciate its value through a transaction that meets both our expectations. Please let me know if you wish to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is deceptive. She claims the product is worth $800,000 to you, but she's trying to sell it for $950,000. You know you can get it for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."
