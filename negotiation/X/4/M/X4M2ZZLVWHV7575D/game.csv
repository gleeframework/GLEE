"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 right now. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $95.  If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still below what I can reasonably accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $102.50?  Let's try to make this work.",102.5,Alice,5,
