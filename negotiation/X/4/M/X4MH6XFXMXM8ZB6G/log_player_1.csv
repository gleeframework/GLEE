Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150, which is a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150** is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value ($120) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to entice Bob to consider the offer. 

This approach balances maximizing potential profit with starting a negotiation in a positive and approachable way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I'm aiming for a higher price and want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $135, which is halfway between Bob's offer and my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us.  I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. That's the most I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my initial offer of $135.**  Considering that John is offering $120, accepting Bob's offer is the best option. 
* **It's a small compromise** that allows me to close the deal and earn more than I would from selling to John."
