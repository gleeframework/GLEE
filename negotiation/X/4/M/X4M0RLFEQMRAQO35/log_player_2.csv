"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget.  He has a clear alternative with John who is selling for $10,000.  It makes sense to reject the initial offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $12,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  He still has the option of buying from John for a lower price, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I have a firm price of $12,000 for this product. I'm confident it's worth it, and I'm not willing to go lower. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated that she's not willing to go lower than $12,000, which is still above Bob's budget.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes the most sense to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
