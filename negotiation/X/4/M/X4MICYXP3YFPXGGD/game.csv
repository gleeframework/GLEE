"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we do $14500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
