"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening move, aiming to maximize my potential profit. I'm aware that Bob might reject this, but I'm prepared to negotiate down from this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm offering $1,700,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob in this round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also getting closer to the point where I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's close to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum value. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm getting increasingly tempted by John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm hoping that Bob will finally recognize the value of the product and accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. We've been negotiating for a while and it's clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum value. I'm running out of time and I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
