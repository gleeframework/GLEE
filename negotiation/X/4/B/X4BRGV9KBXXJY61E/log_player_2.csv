"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product but would need a price closer to $850,000 to make it work for me.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and for sharing your perspective on the value.  While $850,000 is a significant jump, I recognize your interest and want to find common ground.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000? This price reflects the inherent value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $975,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating as I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $850,000.  Perhaps we can settle on $900,000, which is a significant compromise from both sides.  This would allow us to close the deal while ensuring it's a fair value for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $950,000?  This represents a significant concession on my part and feels like a fair deal considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and reach a price closer to my target of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm  getting closer to your price point, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This shows my continued commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with and I respect your approach. Let's make this our final exchange â€“ $937,500. This reflects the middle ground between our last two offers. It's a fair price for a valuable product, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $937,500 is a significant concession, it's still outside my ideal price range.  Given the limited number of rounds left, and the fact that I can purchase the product for $800,000 from John, I believe it's in my best interest to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
