"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product but would need a price closer to $850,000 to make it work for me.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and for sharing your perspective on the value.  While $850,000 is a significant jump, I recognize your interest and want to find common ground.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000? This price reflects the inherent value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $850,000.  Perhaps we can settle on $900,000, which is a significant compromise from both sides.  This would allow us to close the deal while ensuring it's a fair value for both of us. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $950,000?  This represents a significant concession on my part and feels like a fair deal considering the value this product brings.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm  getting closer to your price point, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This shows my continued commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with and I respect your approach. Let's make this our final exchange â€“ $937,500. This reflects the middle ground between our last two offers. It's a fair price for a valuable product, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",937500.0,Alice,7,
