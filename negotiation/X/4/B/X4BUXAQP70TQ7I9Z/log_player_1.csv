Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $900,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still want to try to push for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I'm getting closer to my desired price with Bob,  I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable value, so it's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
