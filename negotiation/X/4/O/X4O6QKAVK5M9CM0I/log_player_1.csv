{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $100 but below your minimum acceptable price of $120, giving you room to negotiate if necessary. It also positions the price as a ""best offer"" to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to $100. Would you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is more than Bob's valuation, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $100. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that amount.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $120 from John."
