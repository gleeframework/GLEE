"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Since you're willing to pay up to $150, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraint, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal. It's lower than John's price and closer to your desired range.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
