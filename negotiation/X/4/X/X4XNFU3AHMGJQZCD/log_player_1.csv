Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly lower than what the product is worth to me, but still higher than what it's worth to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. It also allows me to potentially earn more than the $12,000 from John, if Bob is willing to come up in price."
