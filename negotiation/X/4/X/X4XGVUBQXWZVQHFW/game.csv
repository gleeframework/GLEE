"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to pay $85, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is the absolute highest I'm willing to pay.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again and sell it to you for $102. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
