"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, the product's worth to me is closer to my initial offer. I could meet you halfway at $1,350,000.  This reflects a fair compromise, don't you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,325,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your time and the potential for this deal. How about we settle at $1,337,500? This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me. I'm very close to accepting, but I'd like to see if we can meet at $1,330,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement. ",1330000.0,Bob,6,
