This offer is a starting point that allows for potential negotiation.  It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum desired value. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum desired value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price at this stage."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950000 for the product. It's the highest price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum desired value, it's still significantly below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not yet ready to settle for that price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $975000 for the product. It's the highest price I'm willing to go.

While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum desired value, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and losing the opportunity to sell to John for $1,500,000. It's a guaranteed profit and a safer option."
