"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, reflecting its significant value and future returns for your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,550,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, acknowledging the product's potential and staying within my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
