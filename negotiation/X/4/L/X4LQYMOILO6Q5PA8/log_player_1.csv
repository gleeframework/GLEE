I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This allows for some negotiation room while ensuring I make a profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, I've already had 5 rounds and it's becoming clear that we're far apart on price.  I'm not confident I'll be able to get closer to my desired price with Bob. It's best to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
