"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to secure the product at the lowest possible price. He's starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Alice to meet Bob halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still better than John's offer of $1,200,000, and it's closer to Bob's ideal price.  While there's always a chance Alice might drop the price further, it's not guaranteed.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
