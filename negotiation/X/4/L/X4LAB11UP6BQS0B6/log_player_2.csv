"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $65?"", ""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Target in Mind:** My goal is to pay no more than $80.  By starting at $65, I have room to increase my offer if needed while staying under my limit. 
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important, even when negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $65 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $130. I believe this product offers significant value, even at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $130 is still a bit out of my price range. Could you do $75?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only by a small amount ($10). This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but am still aiming for a significantly lower price.
* **Nearing the Limit:** At $75, I'm getting closer to my maximum budget of $80.  This leaves a little room for negotiation if needed.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price, maintaining a positive tone for the negotiation."
