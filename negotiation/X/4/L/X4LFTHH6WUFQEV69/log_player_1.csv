Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not ready to accept that yet, but I will continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm determined to get at least $150, and I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $130 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $140?  This is a really good deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this point."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $150.  The negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a price that meets my minimum requirement, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to guarantee the $150 from John than to risk getting less from Bob or even no sale at all."
