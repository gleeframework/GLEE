Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $1,350,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I genuinely believe this product can be a great asset to your business, and I hope we can find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,550,000. Since you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John now. You'll save $50,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time in further negotiation."
