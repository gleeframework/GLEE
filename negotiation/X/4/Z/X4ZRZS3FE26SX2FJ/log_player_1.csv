"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using a question at the end to invite Bob to respond and start a conversation.

**Note:** This is just my initial strategy. I will adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining. If Bob rejects my offer, I will consider his counteroffer and my options, including selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below the $1,000,000 minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to entertain a counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, so I'm not desperate to close a deal. I can afford to push for a better price. 

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value but still lower than my initial offer. I will also try to understand his motivations and constraints to see if I can find a way to make a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm compromising by coming down from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still hold firm on my value.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Openness to compromise:** I'm using phrases like ""find common ground"" to signal that I'm open to further negotiation, but within a reasonable range. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise price, I'm aiming to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. This will give me a better understanding of his negotiation style and how much wiggle room I have.  If he rejects this offer, I will likely need to lower my price further in subsequent rounds, but I'm still confident I can secure a deal closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a loss on this product.
* **More rounds available:**  We have 6 rounds remaining, so there's still time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm not desperate to sell immediately.
* **Room for compromise:**  I believe there's still room for compromise.  Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, which gives me hope that we can close the gap in the next few rounds. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still above my minimum. I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and try to understand Bob's motivations for pushing for such a low price.  I'm prepared to make further concessions if necessary, but I'll try to negotiate strategically and maximize my potential earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still holding firm on my price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I've finally reached my absolute minimum price of $1,000,000. 
* **Emphasis on concession:** I'm emphasizing that this is a significant concession to show Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Finality:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning other options.  This might encourage Bob to take the offer before it's too late.

**Strategy:** 

By setting a firm price and hinting at alternatives, I'm aiming to pressure Bob into accepting my offer. If he rejects this, I'll likely have to accept John's offer in the next round to avoid losing out on a substantial amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're holding firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but it's still $25,000 less than what I'm willing to accept.
* **Time is running out:** We have only 4 rounds left, and I'm not confident that I can convince Bob to pay my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to risk losing out on a significant amount of money by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John is the most prudent decision at this point, as it guarantees me a good profit and minimizes the risk of not closing a deal."
