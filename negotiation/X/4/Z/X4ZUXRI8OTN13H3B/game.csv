"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming to secure this product for a price closer to its market value. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to secure the product at a price closer to its market value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my target price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my target price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my need to stay within budget.  Let's work together to find common ground.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1,030,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that balances your needs with my target profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
