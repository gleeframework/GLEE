Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $16,000.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer $15,000 or higher, this is a good deal considering the time we've spent negotiating and the fact that John is willing to pay $15,000.  $14,000 is above my minimum and still a good profit."
