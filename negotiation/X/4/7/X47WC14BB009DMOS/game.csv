"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. The product definitely seems interesting, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep.  Could we possibly agree on $950,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which is $1,000,000. How about we try that?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
