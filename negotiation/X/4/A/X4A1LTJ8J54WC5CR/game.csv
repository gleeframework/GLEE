"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This reflects the value to me and leaves room for us both to make a fair deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is still a good value for you, and I'm willing to work with you to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to me while still providing a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
