"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. This takes into account the unique benefits it offers and its potential for a strong return on your investment.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum is $850,000.  I believe this price is still fair considering the potential value it brings.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I've tried to find a price that works for both of us, but $850,000 falls significantly short of its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I'm open to negotiating further, so I'm proposing $1,050,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial asking price and reflects my willingness to find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, we're still a ways off from a price that reflects the value of this product.  To be candid, I have another potential buyer I could go to, but I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that's you.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a firm price, and I believe it's more than fair.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident that we can close the deal at this price.  It's a good compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
