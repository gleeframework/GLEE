Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This gives you a significant advantage while still reflecting the worth of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 allows me to be bolder in my initial offer to Bob.

This strategy aims for a win-win. Bob gets the product at a price lower than its perceived value to him, and I maximize my profit beyond the guaranteed sale to John."
