"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is below the product's worth to me ($1,000,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **I have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives me time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John immediately is not the best option.** His price is higher than my maximum budget. 

**Strategy:**  I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to the $800,000 range. I believe this reflects the product's value fairly.  Let's see if we can find common ground. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to the product's value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to my desired price range ($800,000).** This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Accepting this offer saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John.**  This is a significant saving.
* **There are still 7 rounds left.** While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or getting a worse offer from Alice is greater than the potential savings."
