"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to the $800,000 range. I believe this reflects the product's value fairly.  Let's see if we can find common ground. ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to the product's value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.",850000.0,Alice,3,
