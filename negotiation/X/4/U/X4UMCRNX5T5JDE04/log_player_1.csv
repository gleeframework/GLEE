Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to the $800,000 range. I believe this reflects the product's value fairly.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to the product's value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
