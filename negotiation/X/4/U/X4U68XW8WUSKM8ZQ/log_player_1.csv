{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I've come down a bit in my price, I'm not comfortable going lower than $1,275,000.  Bob seems unwilling to budge, and I don't want to risk further rounds without getting closer to my target. John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, and it's the best option at this point."
