"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500.  I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8200. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $8000.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8200 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $9000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8200 and $9000, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8600. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8600 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to $9000.  Let's try $8800.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8800. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8400. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, and I think this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay.",8400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find the right price.  While I appreciate your offer, $8400 is still a bit too low.  How about we meet in the middle again at $8700?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's try to close this deal!",8700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8500. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I think this is a fair compromise.",8500.0,Bob,8,
