"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $900,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $875,000. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice will dig in, and he could end up buying from John at a higher price. At $875,000, Bob is saving a significant amount compared to John's offer and is still getting a good deal."
