Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit low for me.

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.
