Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit low for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $800,000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $25,000 above my maximum budget.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like she's not willing to budge further.  To avoid further negotiation and potential delays, I'm going to go ahead and purchase the product from John at my target price of $800,000."
