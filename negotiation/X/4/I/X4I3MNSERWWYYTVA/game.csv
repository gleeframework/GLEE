"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value and its potential impact on your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $800,000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
