{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm not willing to go below $900,000 as that is significantly closer to my minimum value than his.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or just going with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm interested in selling the product, his offer is significantly below my minimum value and doesn't represent a good deal for me. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my original offer.  How about $850,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it would be fair to me as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm not willing to risk losing the sale entirely by holding out for a higher price.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that is still acceptable to me."
