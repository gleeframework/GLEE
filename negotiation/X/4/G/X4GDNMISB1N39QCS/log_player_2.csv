"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John if you don't get a good deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,200,000. This is the price I'm willing to pay, and it's the price John is offering.  If Alice accepts, I get the best possible deal. If she rejects, we can continue to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, so I'll reject this offer and see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price point.  I'm going to offer $1,300,000 as a compromise. This is still within my budget and shows I'm willing to negotiate.  If she accepts, it's a good deal for me. If she rejects, we can continue to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to my ""walk-away"" price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is only $50,000 more than my counteroffer. This is a good deal, especially since I'm close to my maximum price and the alternative is buying from John for $1,200,000.  It's likely that if I reject, we'll just go back and forth and I might end up paying more than this in the end."
