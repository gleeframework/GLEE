"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $900,000. This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $875,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000,  which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this.",890000.0,Alice,5,
