,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
