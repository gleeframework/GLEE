"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I believe this is a good starting point that allows for negotiation and leaves room for both of us to potentially come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm getting closer to the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds and I'm not convinced he's willing to meet my price.  I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John."
