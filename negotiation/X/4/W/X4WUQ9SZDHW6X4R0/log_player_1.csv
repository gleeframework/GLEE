Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value but avoids being overly specific. This encourages Bob to counter-offer if he's interested while keeping my options open. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I have some time and flexibility. If I need to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be more suitable.
*  Bob's negotiation skills and willingness to pay are unknown.  Observing his response to this initial offer will be crucial for my next move."
