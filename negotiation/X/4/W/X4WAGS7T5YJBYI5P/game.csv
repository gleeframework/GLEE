"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and it's the highest I can offer at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is your top offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",815000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $815,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I can go up to $805,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",805000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $805,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $812,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",812500.0,Alice,7,
