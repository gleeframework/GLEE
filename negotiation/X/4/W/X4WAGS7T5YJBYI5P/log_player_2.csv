"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are looking to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still quite a bit more than what you want to spend. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you room to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You don't want to immediately go for the more expensive option without exploring other avenues."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price.** While it's closer, you're still aiming to save as much as possible.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.** You're still in the early stages, and there's room to see if you can get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a backup plan.**  You haven't exhausted all your options with Alice yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and it's the highest I can offer at this point."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your top offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your target, but close.**  You're close to finding a deal you might accept, but you want to try to squeeze out a bit more.
* **You have a few rounds left.**  There's still time to negotiate further and potentially get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a safe option.** You want to exhaust all possibilities with Alice before resorting to the more expensive option."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $815,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I can go up to $805,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 805000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $805,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $812,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target price.**  At $812,500, you're only $12,500 above your desired price point.
* **You have a few rounds left, but the negotiation is getting tight.** Continuing to reject offers risks the deal falling apart, especially with John as a backup.
* **The product is valuable to you.** This isn't just about saving a few dollars; you want the product. At this point, it's worth accepting a slightly higher price to secure the deal."
