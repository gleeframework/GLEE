"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm ready to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $11,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,900 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
