Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than $100, your minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $130 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, so he might be willing to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially negotiate higher if Bob is interested.

This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest while still securing a decent price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could try to negotiate further,  Bob's offer of $120 is still a good deal for you. It's above your minimum of $100 and closer to your desired price than what John is offering. Accepting this offer ensures a quicker sale and a higher profit than selling to John."
