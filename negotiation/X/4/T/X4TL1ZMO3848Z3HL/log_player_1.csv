Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a profitable price for me, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to accept."
