"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still represents a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1400000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of this product. Let's try to find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  $1400000 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1600000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while being within your budget.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $1600000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1500000. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to pay $1550000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget limitations. Let's close this deal!",1550000.0,Bob,6,
