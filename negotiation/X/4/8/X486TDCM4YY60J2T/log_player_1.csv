Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** This is friendly and upbeat, but also emphasizes the product's value. 

I'm starting high to see if I can get a good price.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $13000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $14,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a compromise between my original asking price and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **The message:** This is still friendly and emphasizes that I want a deal to work out. 

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to potentially negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $14000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a little over budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is just above my minimum value of $12,000.  It's a good compromise, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
