Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$175** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still potentially acceptable. 
* The message is friendly and invites negotiation, which is crucial to maximize your earnings. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  Setting a high initial price creates room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your desired $150 minimum.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  By not immediately accepting Bob's counteroffer, you can explore if you can get closer to your desired price.
* **Utilize John as a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $150 provides a solid fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:** You can propose a price closer to your desired range.
* **Test Bob's willingness to negotiate:**  His willingness to counteroffer indicates he's genuinely interested in the product.

Selling to John immediately would secure you $150, but rejecting Bob's offer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $140 is a compromise price, closer to Bob's offer but still above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting ""good deal"" for Bob reinforces the value proposition. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** A reasonable counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Move closer to your goal:**  $140 is a significant improvement over $120 and brings you closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is just below your minimum acceptable price of $150. However, considering the following:

* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and his offer is closer to your minimum than his previous offer.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to reject his offers might risk losing him as a buyer altogether.
* **John's Offer:** You have a solid backup option with John, ensuring you won't lose out completely.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $130 is the most reasonable option at this point. It secures a sale and allows you to potentially use the extra time to explore other buyers or future deals."
