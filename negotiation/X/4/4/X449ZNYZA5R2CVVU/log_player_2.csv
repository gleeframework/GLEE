Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product.  It's a very unique piece, and I believe its value is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think you'd be very happy with the product.
