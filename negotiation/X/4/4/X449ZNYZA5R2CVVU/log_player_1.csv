Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than your minimum value of $12,000. It gives you room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, aiming to build a rapport with Bob and highlight the value of the product. 

**Strategy:** 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize initial profit:** By starting high, you maximize potential profit.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will give you insight into his perceived value of the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This price allows for some downward movement if Bob counters.
* **Plan for the backup option:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, you can always sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I appreciate his interest, accepting this offer would result in a loss. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob.  This will give me the opportunity to try and bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product.  It's a very unique piece, and I believe its value is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think you'd be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, explaining my reasoning for rejecting it, and emphasizing the product's value. I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" and focusing on a positive outcome for both parties. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating willingness to compromise can encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  By offering a price higher than my minimum, I retain leverage in the negotiation.
* **Maintain positive communication:**  A friendly tone helps keep the negotiation open and potentially avoid an impasse."
