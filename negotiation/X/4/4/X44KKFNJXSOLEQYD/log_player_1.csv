Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a reasonable starting point.** It's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.** This encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob to try to secure a better price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my target without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to drop to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500 is a reasonable counteroffer.** It's a compromise, showing flexibility while still being closer to my minimum value than Bob's offer.
* **The message is polite and emphasizes the compromise.** This keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to accept.

My strategy is to gradually increase the offer until I either reach a price I'm comfortable with or Bob decides to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your desired price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is still below my minimum value, it's getting closer.  Considering Bob's budget constraints and the risk of him ultimately going with John, accepting his offer seems like the best option at this point. 

Here's why:

* **Minimizing risk:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept a further counteroffer, and if he rejects it, I might have to sell to John for $15,000 anyway. 
* **Closing the deal:** $10,000 is still a profitable sale for me, and it ensures I secure a deal with Bob.
* **Potential for future business:** Even though it's a bit lower than ideal, building a positive relationship with Bob could lead to more opportunities in the future."
