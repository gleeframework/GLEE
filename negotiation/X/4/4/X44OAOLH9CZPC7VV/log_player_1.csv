"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm not sure what Bob's budget is, so I'm starting with a significant markup on my minimum acceptable price.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering.  I want to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's also a significant step down from my initial offer. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm going to keep negotiating with him for a bit longer.  I'm not ready to settle for $900,000, but I'm open to finding a compromise closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I think this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to sell the product for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but he's getting closer. I'm going to continue negotiating with him, but I'm also going to start considering selling to John as a backup plan.  There's a chance Bob might not be willing to go any higher, so it's important to have another option available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,050,000.  This is a significant drop from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and I'm getting closer to where Bob might be willing to meet me.  This round, I'm going to start seriously thinking about selling to John if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below it.  I've been negotiating with him for a while now, and I'm starting to feel like he might not be willing to go any higher.  To secure a guaranteed profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While it's not the highest price I could potentially get, it's a safe and reliable option, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future."
