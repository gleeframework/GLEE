"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1000000. Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,000,000, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,500,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this unique offering. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can find a way to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired value, I'm still holding out for a bit more. John's offer of $1,200,000 is my safety net, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob just yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and the opportunity it presents. Let's reach an agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1200000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we've discussed. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation! Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's offer, so it seems like I'm at a crossroads.  However, it's important to remember that John is a guaranteed sale, while there's always a chance that Bob could still reject my offer. 

Since I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, I'm going to take his offer and sell to him.  There's always the risk of a counteroffer, but at this point, I'm happy with the outcome and prefer to avoid any further risk."
