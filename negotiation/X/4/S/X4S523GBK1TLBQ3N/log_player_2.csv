Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is low, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,125. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very slowly coming down in price, and it's unlikely we'll get her much lower than $10,125.  Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option at this point to save the most money."
