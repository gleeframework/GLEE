Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible. Offering it at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so offering it slightly below your guaranteed sale price creates a sense of potential value for him.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. Bob might be more inclined to accept knowing he could miss out."
