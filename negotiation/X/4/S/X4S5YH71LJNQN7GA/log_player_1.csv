``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I'm getting a good price ($10,000), but there's still room for negotiation. It also leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, which could lead to a successful transaction.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to counteroffer him to a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,500 to make this work.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price than his previous offer, and it's still a reasonable profit for me. I'm happy to accept this offer and move forward with the sale."
