"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will benefit your business. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and quality.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, but also shows I'm willing to compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows both of us to come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $11,000, but I'll throw in a bonus feature that's usually worth $1,000. This will bring the total value of the deal to $12,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and the bonus feature.",11000.0,Alice,5,
