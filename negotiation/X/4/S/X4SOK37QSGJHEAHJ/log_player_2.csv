Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, but also shows I'm willing to compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $11,000, but I'll throw in a bonus feature that's usually worth $1,000. This will bring the total value of the deal to $12,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and the bonus feature.
