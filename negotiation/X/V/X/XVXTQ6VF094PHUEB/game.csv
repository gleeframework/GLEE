"Hey Alice,  $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 for it right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can make this work.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $130? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this great product.",130.0,Alice,5,
