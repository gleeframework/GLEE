"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. It's a fair offer considering the market and my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,025,000 is still a touch high for me.  How about we settle at $980,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",980000.0,Bob,6,
