Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me ($120) and to Bob ($80).  It allows for some profit for me while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's closer to my desired price, it still falls short of my minimum acceptable value of $120. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $105. This is a compromise that allows me to earn more than Bob's offer of $100 while still being within a reasonable range for him.  I believe this is a fair price that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $120.  Bob's counteroffer of $95 is too low for me, and continuing to negotiate with him risks wasting time and possibly ending up with a lower price.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired value, making it the most profitable option at this point."
