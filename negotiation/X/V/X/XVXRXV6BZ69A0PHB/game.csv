"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,150,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
