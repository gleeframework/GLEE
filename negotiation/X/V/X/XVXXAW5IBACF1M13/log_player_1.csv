Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $1,200,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000  allows for a reasonable profit for me while still being a good deal for Bob.  This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,200,000 from John, so there is limited risk in offering a price closer to Bob's maximum."
