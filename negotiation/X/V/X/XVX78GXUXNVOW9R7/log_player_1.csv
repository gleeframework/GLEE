Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for more negotiation room. 
* **Justification:**  I've provided a brief justification for the price, highlighting its value and potential. 
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages Bob to respond, fostering an open dialogue. 

**Strategy:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  This establishes a higher starting point for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:** The initial offer is significantly higher than my minimum value, allowing for potential concessions if necessary.
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can secure at least my minimum value if negotiations with Bob fail."
