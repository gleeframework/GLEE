Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While $10,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $11500, which would be $11250. Can you consider that?

It's getting close, but I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the safest option at this point."
