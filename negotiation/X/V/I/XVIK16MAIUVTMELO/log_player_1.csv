"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I create space for Bob to counteroffer without immediately rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $120 is my minimum, I know the product is worth more. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get a better price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** It's important to show Bob I'm not afraid to walk away from the deal if I don't feel it's fair. This strengthens my bargaining position. 
* **Time Left:** I have 8 rounds remaining, which gives me plenty of opportunity to negotiate without rushing into a deal I'm not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $135 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm not giving away too much.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob that the product has value, and that my counteroffer still reflects this.
* **Encourage Acceptance:** The message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are already in round 4, and the negotiation could potentially drag on for a while. 
* **Avoiding John:**  While John will pay my minimum, accepting Bob's offer ensures I make slightly more. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even if I accept Bob's offer, this might open the door for future transactions with him if he finds the product valuable."
