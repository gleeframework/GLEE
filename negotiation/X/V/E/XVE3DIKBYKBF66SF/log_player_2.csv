"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really like. I'm looking to sell it to you for $180. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is above your maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $120?  This is my maximum budget for this type of item.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'd like to make a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150. Would you be interested in that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $150 is lower than her original price, it's still above your budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price. If Alice won't budge, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Would you consider $130?  It's a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, but I'd like to make another compromise. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $140 is still above your budget of $120.  While you've successfully negotiated her down from her initial price, you've reached a point where it's no longer worth continuing the negotiation.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John at your target price of $120 and avoid further back-and-forth with Alice."
