"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than your initial assessment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Rejecting her offer allows you to move forward with your backup plan and save a significant amount of money ($400,000)."
