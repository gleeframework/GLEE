"Thanks for your honest offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on $90, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $88, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to buy from John.",88.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I can do $92, but I'm really not comfortable going any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that. Let's meet in the middle at $90, or I'll have to consider selling to John.",92.0,Alice,9,
