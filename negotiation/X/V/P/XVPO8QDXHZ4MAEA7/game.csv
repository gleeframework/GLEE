"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go below $1030000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but that's as low as I'll go. I'm offering you the product for $1020000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"I've already made significant concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $1015000. This is my final offer. I'm not willing to budge any further. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,9,
