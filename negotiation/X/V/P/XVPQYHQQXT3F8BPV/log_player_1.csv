Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still get a good deal.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as fair and reasonable, encouraging Bob to consider the value he'll gain. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product at a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel Bob is not serious, I can always opt to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's higher than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's interest in the product and his counteroffer suggest there's room for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll need to find a balance between securing a good price and not pushing Bob away completely."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value this product holds, I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. It's a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain from this product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a price closer to my desired range.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob and framing the counteroffer as a compromise, making it seem like a fair and reasonable solution.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price while still accommodating his needs.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess whether to make another counteroffer or to sell to John, considering the potential for a protracted negotiation and the risk of losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1200000, and I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob's offer is stuck at $1,200,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially losing John as a buyer.
* **Safeguarding my value:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't settle for a significantly lower offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale, ensuring I receive my minimum acceptable price for the product."
