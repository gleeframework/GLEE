Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is close to my ideal outcome but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price.

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm starting high, hoping for a quick deal at a good price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, I can adjust my price while still potentially getting a favorable outcome.
* **Preserve option to sell to John:**  I haven't ruled out selling to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a gap between our positions that allows for further negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my original offer. I need to find a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring that Bob remains interested in the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintain high value:** I'm not dropping my price significantly, signaling the product's value remains high.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome. I'm also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $875000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Time is a factor:** Further negotiation could drag on, and John's offer is a tempting alternative.
* **Agreement is likely:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is close to my price.

**Outcome:**

While it's not my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of losing out to John or continuing a lengthy negotiation."
