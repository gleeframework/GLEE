"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to go down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $125?,125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? This is a great price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $130. Would you be willing to go down to $125.50?,125.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $125.50 just isn't going to cut it for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $128. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally get this deal done.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm getting close to walking away. Would you be willing to go down to $126?,126.0,Bob,8,
