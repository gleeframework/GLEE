"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in this product but $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $9750? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10000 is still a little out of my range. I'm prepared to go up to $9850. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this quickly.  What do you say?",9850.0,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9850. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9850 and $10000, so I'm offering the product to you for $9925. This is the best I can do.",9925.0,Alice,7,,
