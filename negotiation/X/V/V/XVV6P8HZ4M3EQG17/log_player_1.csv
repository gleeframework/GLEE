"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential room to come down if needed. I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit more from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. It shows flexibility while aiming to secure a price closer to my desired value."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $855,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $855,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I think there's still room to push for a higher price. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's a reasonable price point that could be appealing to Bob."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $855,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're running out of rounds.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk ending up with nothing or having to settle for John's lower offer."
