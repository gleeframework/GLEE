"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, we believe it's worth more than $150. However, I understand everyone has their own valuation, so I'm willing to negotiate. Considering its worth to me and the market value, I propose selling it to you for $120. This price not only ensures a fair deal but also allows us to part with an item that has served us well. I hope you find this offer attractive and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can move to your backup plan and secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
