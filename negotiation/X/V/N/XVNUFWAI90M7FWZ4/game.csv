"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, we believe it's worth more than $150. However, I understand everyone has their own valuation, so I'm willing to negotiate. Considering its worth to me and the market value, I propose selling it to you for $120. This price not only ensures a fair deal but also allows us to part with an item that has served us well. I hope you find this offer attractive and look forward to your response.",120.0,Alice,1,
