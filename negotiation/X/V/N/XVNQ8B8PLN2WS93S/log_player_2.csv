"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's too risky to accept this offer. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Starting with $7,000 is a reasonable starting point. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and indicates Bob's seriousness about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price has come down, it's still above Bob's target price. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if he can push for a lower price. There are still rounds left, and there's a chance Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer, as it is his absolute maximum budget.  If Alice rejects this, Bob will move on to purchase from John. The offer is bold, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting the best deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's getting late in the negotiation process, and there's a high risk that Alice will continue to hold out for a higher price.  At this point, it's more sensible for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000.  This guarantees him the product at a price he's comfortable with."
