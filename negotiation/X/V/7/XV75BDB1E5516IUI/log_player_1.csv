Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by negotiating further.  I want to see if I can push him closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,400,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,575,000? This price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,575,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum, and John is also offering the same.  Since I have a guaranteed sale with John, I'm going to choose to sell the product to him to avoid further negotiation."
