"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $100. You want to save as much money as possible, and you know you can get it for $80 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us.

You still have room to negotiate.  You know you can get it for $80 from John, so reject Alice's offer and see if you can get her to come down further."
