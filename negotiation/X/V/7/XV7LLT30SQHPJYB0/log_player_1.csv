Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $80 but below your minimum valuation of $120.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer. It also shows that you're willing to compromise and not just stick to your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum valuation of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $90. I think it's a fair price that we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum valuation, $90 is a good compromise and is still a profit for me. It's better than risking losing the sale and having to sell to John for $120, which would mean losing out on a potential profit."
