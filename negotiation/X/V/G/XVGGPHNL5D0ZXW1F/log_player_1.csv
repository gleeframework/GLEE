{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $100 is higher than Bob's valuation of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's above your minimum of $120, so you're still making a profit. 
* **It's a fair starting point:** This offer allows for a good back-and-forth negotiation where both parties can potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

It's important to remember that this is just the first offer. You'll need to be flexible and adapt your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is above Bob's valuation and would still be a profit for you, it's significantly lower than the $120 you could get from John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating with him, potentially reaching a higher price, or to move on to John if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to drop the price a bit further, how about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:**  It's a lower price than your initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Remains profitable:** $95 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you still make a profit.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  There's still potential for Bob to counter again, but the price is moving in a direction that might lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $85 is my absolute limit. I'd be willing to pay that price. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below your minimum of $120. While you could continue negotiating, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to go higher.  Selling to John for $120 ensures you maximize your profit.  While it would be nice to make a deal with Bob, it's not worth risking getting a lower price or a drawn-out negotiation that could lead to John taking the opportunity."
