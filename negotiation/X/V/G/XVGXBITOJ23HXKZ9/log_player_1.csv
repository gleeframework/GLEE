Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially increasing your profit.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, ensuring you don't lose out on the minimum value."
