"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $7,000. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $9,000? This would still give you a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
