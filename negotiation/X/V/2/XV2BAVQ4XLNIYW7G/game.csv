"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, I think $800,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",650000.0,Alice,5,
