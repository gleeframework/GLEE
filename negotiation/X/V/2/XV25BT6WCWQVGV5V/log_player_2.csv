"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot to me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than John's price, but he's leaving room to negotiate.  He's also given Alice a reason for his counteroffer, making it more likely she'll consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is again offering a price slightly lower than John's, but this time he's emphasizing the fairness of his offer to make it more appealing to Alice.  He's also expressing confidence that they can reach an agreement, which could make her more inclined to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's settle on this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, $9,500 is still above Bob's budget, and he has a guaranteed deal with John for $8,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice as he's likely to get a better price from John."
