,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's settle on this and move forward.",9500.0,Alice,5,
