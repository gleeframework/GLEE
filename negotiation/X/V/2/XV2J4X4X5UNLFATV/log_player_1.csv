Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could try to capture.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to negotiate a higher price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will deliver significant returns for you. I propose a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  Start by highlighting the product's value and your confidence in it.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant portion of the potential surplus for yourself.
* **No Justification:** Avoid justifying the price unless Bob specifically asks. Let him respond first.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance and how confident you are in Bob's eagerness to acquire the product."
