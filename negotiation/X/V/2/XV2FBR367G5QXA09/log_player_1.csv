Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really find useful. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to that. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but slightly below your guaranteed price allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Messaging:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's potential usefulness to Bob without revealing your own valuation or mentioning John."
