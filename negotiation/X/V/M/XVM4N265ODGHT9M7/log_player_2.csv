"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great price, as you know it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. Let me know your decision! If you don't accept, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Alice's attempts to pressure you with another buyer are irrelevant since you have a guaranteed alternative. You lose nothing by rejecting her offer and going with John."
