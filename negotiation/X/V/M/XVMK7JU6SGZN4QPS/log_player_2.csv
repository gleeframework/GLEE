"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to you. Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, but I want to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to my maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is exactly my maximum price. It's not ideal, but I'm happy to accept it rather than risk a counteroffer being rejected or going through a lengthy negotiation process."
