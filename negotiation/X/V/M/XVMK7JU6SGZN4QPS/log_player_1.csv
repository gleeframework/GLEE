Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, giving me room to negotiate.  I believe this initial offer is high enough to pique Bob's interest but also leaves room for negotiation if he feels the price is too steep.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It's a fair price that acknowledges Bob's lower offer, but still allows me to make a profit beyond my minimum."
