"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price, especially since you know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000.  By rejecting the offer, you open the possibility of getting the product for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, I'm looking to stay within a price range closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price range, you can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to John's offer of $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin further. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,090,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has clearly stated that $1,090,000 is her final offer.  While negotiating further is an option, you know you can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiations when you have a guaranteed price from John that is lower than Alice's final offer."
