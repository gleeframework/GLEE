"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, I'm looking to stay within a price range closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still trying to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $1,025,000?  This would be a significant savings for me, and I believe it still reflects a fair value for the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin further. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,090,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
