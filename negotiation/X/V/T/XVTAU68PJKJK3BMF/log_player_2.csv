"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than what others might pay. I'm extending this opportunity to you for $140. This price not only ensures you get the best deal but also allows me to maximize the value of my product. I trust this offer aligns with your expectations and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's offer of $150, Bob can still do better.  He should reject Alice's offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller with a better deal."
