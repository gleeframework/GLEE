"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its unique qualities, I'm proposing an initial price of $14,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Cost:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, and Alice's offer of $13,250 is significantly closer to his limit than John's price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice could reject his counteroffer, forcing him to either buy from John (at a higher price) or walk away. 
* **Time Consideration:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob time and potential hassle of continued negotiation.

The $13,250 offer is a good compromise for Bob, balancing savings with the potential of securing the product without further delays or risks."
