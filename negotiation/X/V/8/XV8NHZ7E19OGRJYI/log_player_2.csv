"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting price is higher than our maximum budget and leaves little room for negotiation. We can definitely do better by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us bargaining room. 
* **Polite and Interested:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the chance of Alice working with us.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer leaves space for us to potentially meet in the middle if Alice is unwilling to go so low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? This would still be a good deal for you since it's below what you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Excellent Deal:** Alice's offer of $120 is a fantastic price, well below our maximum budget and John's alternative offer.
* **No Guarantee of a Better Offer:** While we might be able to haggle a few more dollars off, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Accepting now secures us a great deal.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting avoids further back-and-forth negotiation, saving us time and effort."
