"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find the product is worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, and Alice's offer of $11,250 is significantly better than buying from John for $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Time:**  With only 10 rounds, it's important to avoid getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price."
