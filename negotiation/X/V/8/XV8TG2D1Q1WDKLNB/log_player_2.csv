"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $150. Would you like to make this purchase today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since John is willing to sell the product for $150, which is Bob's maximum price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. Bob can get the same product for the same price from John."
