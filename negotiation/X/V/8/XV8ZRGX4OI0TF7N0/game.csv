"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects the true value you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. I appreciate you coming down, but to be frank, anything above $700,000 is pushing it for me. If you're willing to meet closer to that number, I'm still interested. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a solution, that price point wouldn't be feasible for me.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to close this deal. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other avenues.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that final offer is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this is $800,000.  If you can't meet that, I understand, and I'll need to pursue other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
