Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that final offer is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this is $800,000.  If you can't meet that, I understand, and I'll need to pursue other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his absolute maximum budget of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Accepting $800,000 is a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
