Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing a figure that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to start negotiations higher. This leaves space for potential negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""unique value"" and ""exclusive opportunity,"" you aim to pique Bob's interest and create a sense of desirability.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** While starting high, you also signal that you're willing to negotiate. This prevents Bob from immediately rejecting the offer and keeps the conversation open.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  How you proceed depends on Bob's reaction. Be prepared to potentially lower the price, but remember your bottom line is $15,000."
