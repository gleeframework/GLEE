{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him a reason to negotiate. 
* **Reflects your minimum:**  It's above your minimum price, ensuring you profit. 
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  It clearly communicates the price you're seeking."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I can still try to get a better price. I'll counteroffer, aiming for a middle ground."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really trying to get the best deal possible, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting close to my minimum of $8,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, there's a risk that he'll walk away. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a profit."
