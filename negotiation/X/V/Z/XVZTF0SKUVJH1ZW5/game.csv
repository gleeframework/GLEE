"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd need to come in lower.  How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That way, we both come out ahead.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum, so I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
