"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1500000, and I'd like to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a more substantial reduction. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? I believe that's a fair price for the product, and it's within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
