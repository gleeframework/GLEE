{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing the potential benefits and encouraging him to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  While still lower than my ideal price, this initial offer gives me a starting point for negotiation.
* **Encourage negotiation:** By setting a price lower than my ideal, I'm showing I'm open to compromise and prompting Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Maintain control:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John, ensuring that I don't accept a price significantly below my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify spending up to $650,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even my initial offer of $1,200,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.  While I am open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to facilitate a deal. This reflects the significant value the product brings to your business, and it's still a fair price considering its capabilities. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price closer to my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise but still maintaining a substantial profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position while reiterating the product's value and highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility and encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Protect my value:**  I'm still significantly above Bob's initial offer, ensuring I don't undervalue the product.
* **Maintain pressure:**  By offering a price lower than my minimum, I'm keeping the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could you consider $725,000?  That's a significant investment for me but would allow me to bring in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  I'm not willing to compromise that much, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price. 

I'll counteroffer again, but I'll be more assertive this time, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, keeping the option to sell to John open."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $725,000.  The product's value and the potential it offers your business justify a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price closer to my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Message:** I'm addressing Bob's concerns about budget while emphasizing the value proposition and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm also using a more assertive tone to signal my commitment to achieving a price closer to my target.

This strategy aims to:

* **Narrow the gap:**  By offering a price closer to my initial offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility while keeping the negotiation within a range that benefits me.
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how it can help his business,  strengthening my position.
* **Maintain pressure:**  By offering a price lower than my minimum, I'm still keeping the option of selling to John open, which adds pressure for Bob to accept a price closer to my goal."
