Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 allows for some potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
