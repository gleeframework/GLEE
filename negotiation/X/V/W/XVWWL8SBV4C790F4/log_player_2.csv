"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $10500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This reflects the value I know you'll get from the product. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
