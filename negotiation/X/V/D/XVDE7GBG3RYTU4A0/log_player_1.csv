Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Knowing Your Worth:**  The product is worth $10,000 to both you and Bob. By asking for $15,000, you're aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation, as you're not desperate to sell to Bob.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards during the negotiation process, keeping in mind your minimum acceptable price ($10,000)."
