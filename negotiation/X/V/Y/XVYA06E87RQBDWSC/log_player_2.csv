"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $1,100,000. It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price. You can counteroffer to buy it for something closer to your price range."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While $1,000,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for us both.  My final offer is $950,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's more than fair given the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's final offer is $950,000. While it is a lower price than her original offer, it's still more than your maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John at a guaranteed price of $800,000."
