Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $800,001 and $1,199,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting high but within a reasonable range. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Confidence:** By saying ""fair deal,"" you subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  How you respond will depend on his counter-proposal and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
