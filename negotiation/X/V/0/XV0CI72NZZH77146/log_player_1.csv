Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:** By starting at $14,000, you increase your chances of getting a price closer to your minimum value of $15,000.
* **Encourage negotiation:** A slightly higher price might incentivize Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always go with John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is not acceptable, there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I aim to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I'll try to secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and can potentially get a better price.
* **Explore potential concessions:**  I'll use the next round to see if Bob is willing to compromise and meet me halfway. 

**Next step:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $12,500 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good value for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is slightly lower than my initial offer:**  I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer:**  This maintains my leverage and demonstrates that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:**  By counteroffering at $13,500, I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum value. 
* **Maintain bargaining power:**  I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm also demonstrating my willingness to be flexible.
* **Create a win-win situation:**  The counteroffer represents a possible compromise that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,500. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $13,000 is just $2,000 below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Continuing negotiation is risky:**  Further negotiations might lead to a lower price, and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  However, I can still get $15,000 from John, so I'm not losing out significantly by accepting Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure a reasonable price:** $13,000 is a decent price considering my minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Minimize risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations and the possibility of a lower price.
* **Maintain a good relationship:**  Accepting Bob's offer shows flexibility and might lead to future business opportunities."
