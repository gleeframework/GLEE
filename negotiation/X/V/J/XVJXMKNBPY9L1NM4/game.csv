"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to my value of $8,000. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,000. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering your value for the product and my minimum selling price. Let's work this out,  what do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price, considering both our positions and leaves room for us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable dropping to $9,500.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I believe we can reach an agreement with this compromise.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
