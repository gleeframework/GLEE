```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. However, $8,500 is significantly below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $9,000.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $8,800 for the product, but that's my final offer.  I think this price is fair and will allow us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8800}

Round 7

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's managed to negotiate a price that's just $800 above John's price. While there's always a chance Alice might come down further, it's unlikely, and he risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer is a good compromise."
