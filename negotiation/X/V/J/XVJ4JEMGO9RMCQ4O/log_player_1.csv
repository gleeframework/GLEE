"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $95 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not willing to settle for a price that's below $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going below $100.  This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you.  Let's meet in the middle and agree on $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move on to finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
