"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $95 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going below $100.  This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you.  Let's meet in the middle and agree on $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move on to finalizing the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
