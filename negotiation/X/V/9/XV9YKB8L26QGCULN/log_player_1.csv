"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for both of us to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not closing the door on further negotiation by leaving room for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I'm not desperate to sell and there's a good chance Bob might come up in price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $14,000 to $13,500. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to help justify my price.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for continued negotiation, but I'm not willing to go lower than $13,500 yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is progressing:** We are getting closer to a possible deal, and I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $13,375.  This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 13375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to meet halfway:**  I'm continuing the pattern of meeting Bob halfway, showing flexibility and a desire to find a solution.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is not high enough:** While Bob has come up slightly, his offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the rounds, and I'm getting closer to needing to sell to John.
* **Guarantee a higher price:** John's offer of $15,000 is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with.

Since there is a guaranteed deal with John, I'm choosing to sell the product to him and not risk further negotiation with Bob."
