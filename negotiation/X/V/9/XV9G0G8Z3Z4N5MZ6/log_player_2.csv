Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to meet you halfway this time, Bob. I think $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I know the product has for you. I can offer it to you for $12,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is clearly not budging from this price range, and it's unlikely we'll get her below $11,500, let alone our target price. Buying from John for $15,000, while not ideal, prevents us from potentially overpaying in the long run if negotiations with Alice continue to stall."
