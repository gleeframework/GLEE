"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save money, it makes sense to see if Alice is willing to lower her price. Rejecting the offer opens up the possibility of a counteroffer and a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount ($20) is a good tactic. It shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if she doesn't come down in price.  It also leaves room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to your target, you can still try to squeeze out a bit more.  Rejecting allows for another counteroffer to potentially get closer to your $80 target or force Alice to accept your previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. Increasing your offer by $5 shows you're flexible but still determined to get a better price. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids risking Alice getting too stubborn."
