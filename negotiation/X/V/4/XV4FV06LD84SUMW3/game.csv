"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $88.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a good deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
