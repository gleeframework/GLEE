"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to his ideal.  He's offering $750,000, which is still well above Alice's value of $800,000 but leaves room for further negotiation. This strategy puts pressure on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her previous offer. However, it is still within Bob's budget, and he can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price.  This is a strong play, as it shows Bob is serious about getting the product while also demonstrating he understands Alice's needs.  Alice is now in a position where she must either accept this offer or risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now too high for Bob's comfort.  At $1,000,000, the deal is no longer significantly better than buying from John at $1,500,000.  Considering Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it's more prudent to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice, which is likely to result in even higher prices."
