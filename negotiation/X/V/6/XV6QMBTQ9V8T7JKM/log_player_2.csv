"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John as a safety net. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value to you. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $750,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  He's got 7 rounds left and John's offer as a backup. By rejecting, Bob can try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $725,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with an offer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and he's only got 5 rounds left.  It's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers, especially with John's price looming.  $775,000 is a decent compromise, and Bob can save a significant amount compared to John's offer."
