"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value to you. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $725,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with an offer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",775000.0,Alice,5,
