"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the value of the product to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value proposition for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,050,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1,175,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth and reflects the value it will bring to your business. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on your price. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.  I'm confident this price works for both of us. Let's try to make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $1,100,000. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you a counteroffer of $1,125,000. This price is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
