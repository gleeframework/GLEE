Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to propose an alternative. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750 for the product? This respects your budget while still allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. Considering your budget constraints, how about we set the product price at $12,250? This is higher than my initial offer but still lower than my previous counteroffer, aiming for a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,250.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $12,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses in the negotiation with Alice and go with the sure thing."
