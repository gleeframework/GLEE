Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $2,300,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept such a significant reduction. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This price is reasonable considering my needs and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firmly set at $1,200,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable.  Selling to John ensures I receive the product's full value for me."
