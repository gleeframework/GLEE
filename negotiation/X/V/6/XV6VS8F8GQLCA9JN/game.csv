"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $2,300,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept such a significant reduction. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This price is reasonable considering my needs and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
