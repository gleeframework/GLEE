"I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product.",125.0,Alice,5,
