Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $10,500 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John, selling to Bob quickly at a good price might be preferable to waiting. 

This strategy balances getting the best price from Bob while acknowledging your fallback option with John."
