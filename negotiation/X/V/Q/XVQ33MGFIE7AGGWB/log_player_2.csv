"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so it's likely that she's overestimating its value. I can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, which is more than what Alice is offering, but I can save $200,000 by buying it from John.
