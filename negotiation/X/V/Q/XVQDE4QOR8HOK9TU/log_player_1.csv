Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth trying to get a slightly higher price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value. It's a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still tempting enough that he might consider it a good deal.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything as I can proceed with selling to John at my desired minimum price."
