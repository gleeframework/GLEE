Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:**  I'm also not starting too high, as $1,700,000 is still below what Bob would likely be willing to pay if he could get it for $800,000. This ensures the negotiation has a starting point that feels reasonable to both parties. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll keep in mind John's offer of $1,500,000 as a safety net, but I'll only take it if I believe I can't get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly values the product, and I can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I won't lose money, but I'm hoping for a better outcome through negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer of $1,700,000, showing a willingness to compromise. It also places the price right in the middle of Bob's offer ($800,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Fair compromise:** This compromise is likely to be appealing to Bob, as it allows him to get the product for a price significantly lower than what he initially offered.
* **Maintaining value:** This offer still ensures that I'm earning a profit that's above my minimum value, making it a worthwhile deal for me. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will assess his next offer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can likely push him a bit higher. 
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a profit, but I'm not ready to settle for that yet. There's a good chance I can get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value, likely somewhere between $1,100,000 and $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counter:**  This counteroffer is a slight decrease from my previous offer of $1,200,000, showing a willingness to compromise further. 
* **Testing the waters:** This price is still above Bob's latest offer of $900,000, but it's closer to his range, indicating a potential meeting point.
* **Maintaining value:** This offer is still above my minimum value of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose money even if Bob rejects this counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a reasonable price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next offer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or finally selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still below my desired profit margin. It seems like we're reaching a stalemate.
* **Time is money:**  The negotiation is taking longer than expected, and it's not clear if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures a profit, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept John's offer and conclude the negotiation with Bob."
