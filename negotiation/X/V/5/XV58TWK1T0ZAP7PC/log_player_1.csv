"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation and ensures that Bob has some incentive to accept. 

I want to leave room for potential counter-offers while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Bob's offer is too low. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This price also leaves room for further counteroffers, potentially allowing me to close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price. Additionally, I'm hesitant to accept an offer lower than what John is willing to pay, as I have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $10,500, which is just slightly above John's offer.  I'm doing this for a few reasons:

1. **Time is running out:**  We are halfway through the negotiations, and I need to be realistic about getting a higher price.
2. **Testing Bob's limits:** By offering a price only slightly above John's offer, I'm essentially putting the pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal. 
3. **Maintain a slight advantage:**  This price is still above my minimum, and it allows me to potentially squeeze out a few more dollars if Bob is willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below John's offer, and I want to try and get a little closer to my desired price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can potentially squeeze out a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $10,200. This is a significant concession, but still above John's offer and only $200 away from my minimum.  With only 3 rounds left, I need to be strategic. 

* **Pressure tactic:** By offering a price close to my minimum, I'm putting the pressure on Bob to decide. He might be willing to meet me halfway to secure the deal.
* **Minimizing risk:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back to selling to John, securing a guaranteed profit. 
* **Potential for a last-minute deal:** Even if Bob doesn't accept, I can still make a final counteroffer in the next round, potentially squeezing out a few more dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 2 rounds remaining, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are slim. Bob's offer is still lower than what John is willing to pay. 

To guarantee a sale and a profit, it's better to sell to John for $10,000. This ensures a secure outcome and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price or no deal at all."
