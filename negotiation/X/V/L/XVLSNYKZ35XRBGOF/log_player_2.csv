Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in mind for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stubbornly clinging to a price point that's significantly higher than your absolute limit ($800,000). She's only come down $50,000 from her previous offer, suggesting she might be less flexible. It's unlikely she'll reach a price you're comfortable with in the remaining rounds.  

It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
