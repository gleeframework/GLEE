"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and the opportunity for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,275,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
