Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:**  He values the product at $15,000, so paying $14,000 gives him a $1,000 savings. 
* **It's a good profit for me:** I value the product at $12,000, so this offer gives me a $2,000 profit.
* **It's better than selling to John:**  If Bob rejects, I can still make a $2,000 profit by selling to John, but by offering $14,000 to Bob, I'm increasing my potential earnings.

By offering this price, I'm likely to secure a sale with Bob, resulting in a higher profit than if I sold to John."
