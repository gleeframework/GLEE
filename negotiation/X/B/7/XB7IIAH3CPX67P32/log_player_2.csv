You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for cheaper than $14,000, as it's worth $12,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's offer and your maximum price point. It's a reasonable starting point that shows you're serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum, it's still above the product's value to her. There's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows you to try again with a slightly higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price. It's closer to Alice's offer, increasing the chance of acceptance while still remaining within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $13,600, which is very close to your counteroffer of $13,500. It's a good deal, saving you $1,400 compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal within your budget and saves valuable time."
