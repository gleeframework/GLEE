Bob's final offer is still below my desired price.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,237,500.  Since we've reached a stalemate, I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than risking losing out on any profit at all."
