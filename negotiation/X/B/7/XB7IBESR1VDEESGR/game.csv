"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $710,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $720,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit.",720000.0,Alice,5,
