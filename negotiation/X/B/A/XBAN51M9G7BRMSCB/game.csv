"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this item. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That way we both get a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still aiming to keep my spending within $80. Could we perhaps meet closer to my budget at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
