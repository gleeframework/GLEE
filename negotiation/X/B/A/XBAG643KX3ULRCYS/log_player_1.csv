{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation without immediately risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $8,000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you being willing to pay a premium. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away and I'll end up selling to John for less than I'd like. It's better to take the deal and secure a sale."
