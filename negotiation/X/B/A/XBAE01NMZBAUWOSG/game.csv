"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $750,000 is a bit high. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
