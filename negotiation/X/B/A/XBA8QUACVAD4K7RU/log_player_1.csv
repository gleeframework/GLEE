Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point.  It's high enough that I still make a profit, but low enough to be tempting to Bob.  I'm leaving room for negotiation and hoping Bob will make a counteroffer. If he doesn't, I can always go to John and get my full asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get for the product. I'm going to try to get closer to my ideal price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 
 
I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise while still getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, the risk of him continually lowering his offer is too high.  It's unlikely he'll get much closer to my ideal price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed $15,000 offer."
