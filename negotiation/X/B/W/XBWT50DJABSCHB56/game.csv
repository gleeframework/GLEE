"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford that price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the potential for us both to benefit from this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, and I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product and my financial limitations.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $1,200,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price if you can guarantee a quick and smooth transaction. No further negotiations, we close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
