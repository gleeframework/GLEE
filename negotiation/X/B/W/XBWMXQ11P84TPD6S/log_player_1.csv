{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  By offering a price slightly lower than the product's worth to Bob, you increase the chances of him accepting the offer while maximizing your own profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it is still below your desired price and worth negotiating further.  You can likely secure a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $850,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's finalise this now."", ""product_price"": 900000}
