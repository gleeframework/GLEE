"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth a lot to you. Let's make a deal!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify going as high as $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer the product for $812,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable asset.  What do you say?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $790,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",790000.0,Bob,6,
