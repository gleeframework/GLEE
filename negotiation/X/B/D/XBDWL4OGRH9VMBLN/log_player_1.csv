"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. I have a safety net with John's offer of $15,000, so I can afford to be bold. This initial offer will likely be rejected, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more. We have 8 rounds remaining, and I'm confident that I can reach a more favorable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $16,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a more reasonable compromise than my initial offer. I believe this price will be more tempting for Bob, as it's closer to his desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. This is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I've successfully reached my goal of $15,000, and I'm happy to finalize the sale."
