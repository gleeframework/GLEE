**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently lowering his offer and is unlikely to meet my minimum price of $12,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer. Holding out for a potentially slightly higher offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of him further lowballing or the deal falling through."
