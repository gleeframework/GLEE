{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's also above the product's value to her ($1,000,000). This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to propose a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,210,000 is getting close to my budget, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk further negotiation. I've already made significant concessions, and it's likely that she won't go any lower.  It's better for me to take the sure thing and purchase from John at $1,500,000, even though it's more expensive. This ensures I get the product without the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice."
