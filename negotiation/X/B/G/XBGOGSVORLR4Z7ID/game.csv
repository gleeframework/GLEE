"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,000,000. It's a significant value proposition for you, given its worth to you. Let's start the conversation and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1 million to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This reflects the significant value this product holds and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, I still need to be compensated for the value of this product. Let's split the difference and go with $937,500. This offer represents a fair compromise and will allow us to finalize this deal.  Let's make this happen.",937500.0,Alice,5,
