"Hi Alice,  $2,200,000 is way out of my price range. Given the value it holds for me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a good price, but  $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from what I can accept. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the value it brings.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand we're both trying to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
