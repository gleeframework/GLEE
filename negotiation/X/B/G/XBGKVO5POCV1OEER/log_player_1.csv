"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence about the product's value might influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""What do you think?"" implies you are open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $2,200,000 is way out of my price range. Given the value it holds for me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While he's showing willingness to negotiate, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if you can reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,700,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stay Firm:** By making a significant price reduction, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. However, you're still aiming for a price well above Bob's offer and closer to your minimum.
* **Justification:** Briefly reiterating the product's value reminds Bob why the price is justified.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  The phrase ""meet you halfway"" suggests a desire to find a compromise that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a good price, but  $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob is likely using a negotiation tactic by stating this is his final offer. It doesn't necessarily mean he won't negotiate further, but it's a way to apply pressure.
* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below your $1,500,000 minimum and your walk-away point (selling to John).
* **Room for Negotiation:**  You have six rounds remaining. It's worth seeing if you can push Bob closer to your desired price range before considering John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from what I can accept. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress, but Firm:**  You're recognizing Bob's movement while clearly stating his offer is not yet acceptable.
* **Slight Concession:** You're coming down slightly from your $1,500,000 walk-away point to signal a willingness to compromise, but not by much. This keeps the pressure on Bob.
* **Reiterating Value:** Reminding him of the product's value reinforces your position that the price is justified.
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, you can subtly imply a sense of time pressure (without being aggressive) as you get closer to potentially accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand we're both trying to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is now above your $1,100,000 minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong Position Weakening:** While you could potentially push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob will walk away if he's already at his maximum. Accepting now secures a significant profit. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now also has value, as it avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the potential need to involve John."
