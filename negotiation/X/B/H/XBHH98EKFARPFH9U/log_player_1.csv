{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a product that will bring you significant value. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,450,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
