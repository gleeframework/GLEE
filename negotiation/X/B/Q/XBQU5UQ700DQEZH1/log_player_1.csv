{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more receptive.  I'm aiming for a high price, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a respectable offer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $900,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that reaching a mutually agreeable price will be difficult.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, so that's the best course of action."
