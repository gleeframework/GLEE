{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you consider $700,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While your offer is lower than I anticipated, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to come down to $850,000. This reflects the substantial value this product can bring to your operations.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product."",
 ""product_price"": 775000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 still doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can reach a final agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is steadily coming down, and we're getting closer to her value. While $825,000 is a decent price, we still have room to negotiate and try to get closer to $800,000 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. $825,000 is close, but I'm aiming for a final price of $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Acknowledges Alice's concessions:**  It shows we recognize her willingness to negotiate. 
* **Presents a firm but fair offer:**  $800,000 is our target, and we're making that clear.
* **Leaves room for Alice to accept:** While firm, it's not an ultimatum. Alice might accept to avoid further negotiation."
