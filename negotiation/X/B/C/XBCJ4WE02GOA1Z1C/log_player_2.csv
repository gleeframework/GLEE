"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've carefully cultivated and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This price represents a fair value for both of us, allowing me to achieve a solid return while still offering you a significant discount on its true worth.  I understand this is a considerable investment, but I'm certain the product's potential will more than justify the cost.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
