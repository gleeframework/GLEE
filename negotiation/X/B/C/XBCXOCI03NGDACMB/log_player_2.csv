"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $80. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  We know we can get the product for $80 from John, so we have room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $80 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $70? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me make you an offer of $75 for the product. This is my best offer, considering the value and quality provided. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down from her initial price, and $75 is still a good deal for me. I don't want to risk losing the opportunity and having to buy from John at $80."
