{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product for me. While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which still gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to meet somewhere in the middle, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This still yields a substantial profit for me while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue to push for a lower price. The goal is to reach a price as close to $850,000 as possible without going too far and risking a breakdown in the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe a fair compromise would be $887,500 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in between our respective positions and ensures a satisfactory outcome for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is a very good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than what he would pay John and still leaves Alice with a decent profit.  While there might be room for another counteroffer,  the risk of the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  Accepting this offer is the most prudent choice."
