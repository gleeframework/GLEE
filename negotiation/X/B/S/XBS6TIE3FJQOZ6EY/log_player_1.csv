Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $9,000 is still too low."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can only go up to $9,200. Can you consider that?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,200 is still significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's time to close this deal."
