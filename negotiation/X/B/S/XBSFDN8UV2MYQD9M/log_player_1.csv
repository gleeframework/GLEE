Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but lower than the maximum value Bob places on the product ($12,000). This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** A $10,000 sale gives me a profit of $2,000, which is better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **Increase the likelihood of Bob accepting:**  The price is attractive enough to Bob as he'll still get a good deal, and the potential for a lost sale motivates him to consider my offer seriously."
