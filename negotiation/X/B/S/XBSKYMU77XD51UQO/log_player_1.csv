Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Giving him some room to negotiate makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit, and it gives you space to negotiate if he counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This avoids confusion and gets the negotiation started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept such a low offer at this point.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $10,750?  This would be a good compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below the $12,000 I could get from John. I'm not willing to settle for anything below my minimum value yet. I'll counteroffer one last time to see if we can reach an agreement."
