"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $10,750?  This would be a good compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're firm on your price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.  $11,250 is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to go with another buyer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
