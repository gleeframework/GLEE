"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better for Bob to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  He can likely negotiate further with Alice or go with John, whose price is guaranteed.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price from Alice first."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $10,750?  This would be a good compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're firm on your price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.  $11,250 is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to go with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she won't go lower than $11,250, which is still above Bob's budget.  While a counteroffer is possible, it's likely to be rejected again.  Buying from John at $10,000 guarantees the best price for Bob, saving him money and ensuring a successful purchase."
