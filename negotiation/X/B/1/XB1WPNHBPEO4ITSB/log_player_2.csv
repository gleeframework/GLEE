"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This price is a significant discount considering its worth to me, and I'm confident it's a fair offer given its potential benefit for your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.**
* **You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.**  There's a gap between her value ($15,000) and your maximum, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice first.**"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and it's clear you're serious about acquiring this product.  However,  $10,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work for me.  Given the product's value and the potential it offers your business, I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while also ensuring I can meet my own financial needs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget of $10,000.** While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation.
* **You can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer.**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and you can likely get closer to your target price.
* **Buying from John is still an option, but it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice first.**  You've already established some common ground with Alice."
