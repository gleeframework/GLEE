"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a fair price. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This gives you a significant advantage while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? It's a great deal for you and still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking $1,250,000 would be a more comfortable price for me. It's a bit of a compromise, but I think we can both be happy with that.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
