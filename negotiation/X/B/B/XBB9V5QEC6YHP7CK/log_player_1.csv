{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm starting at $110 because:

* It's above Bob's perceived value, giving him a chance to negotiate.
* It's below my minimum, leaving room for potential profit.

The message is friendly and opens the door for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **My Minimum:**  I've stated my minimum is $100, and Bob's offer is below that.
* **Negotiation:**  It's important to show Bob I'm not just going to cave to his first counteroffer. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price. 

I'll now counter with an offer closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet at $95. This is still a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

Here's why I'm countering at $95:

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $100. 

Here's why:

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  John's offer meets my minimum requirement of $100.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further.  Continuing to negotiate could waste time and potentially result in a lower price than John's offer. 
* **Certainty:**  John is a guaranteed buyer, ensuring a smooth transaction.  

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, securing a sale at my minimum value is a good outcome in this situation."
