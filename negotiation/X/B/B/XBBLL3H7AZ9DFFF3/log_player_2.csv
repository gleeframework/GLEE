Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Can we discuss $12,500?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference between your offer and mine from the previous round, and settle on $9,250?"", ""product_price"": 9250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,250 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Let's try to find a sweet spot in between. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,250, so how about $10,625? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,625

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $10,625 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  To be realistic, the most I can offer is $8,000.  This is a fair offer considering my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is the most you're willing to pay, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already met you halfway from $10,625, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is not willing to come close to your budget.  She's rejected your offer of $8,000 twice now, and her counteroffers are not moving significantly in your direction. It's unlikely she'll go much lower than her current offer of $11,250.  

You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Continuing negotiations with Alice carries the risk of not reaching an agreement and potentially missing out on buying from John as well."
