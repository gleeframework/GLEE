"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This price still offers you a great value, and it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to come up a bit, and I appreciate that. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still at my limit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would allow us both to walk away happy with a fair deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we try $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
