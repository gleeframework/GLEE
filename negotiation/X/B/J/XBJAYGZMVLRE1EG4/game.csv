"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $2000000. It's a steal for something this unique and impactful.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This represents a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1700000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1600000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
