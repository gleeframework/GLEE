"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I've carefully assessed its value and believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its worth in the market. This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and her alternative buyer claim could be a negotiating tactic. You have room to negotiate down or see if she'll come closer to your desired price point."
