"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's potential value to me. If you're not willing to accept it, I'm ready to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.
