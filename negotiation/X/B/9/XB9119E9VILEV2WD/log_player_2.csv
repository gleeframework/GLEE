# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $1150000. This offer is exclusive and valid for the next 3 days. Kindly let me know if this meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than buying from John, it's still too high. It's worth exploring if a lower price can be negotiated before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is appreciated, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while still allowing for a fair profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value you see in the product and aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution, I am proposing a price of $1100000 for the product. This offer is valid for the next 3 days. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price by $50,000, but Bob is still trying to get the best deal. He's willing to pay more than $1,000,000 (Alice's value) but wants to see if he can get closer to his target of $1,050,000. There's still room for negotiation and a counteroffer is likely to lead to a better outcome."
