Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $150. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to negotiation:** By stating I'm ""open to negotiation"", I signal flexibility and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Enthusiasm:**  I'm using positive language (""amazing"", ""enjoy"") to create a positive impression and potentially make Bob more inclined to buy.

**Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the flow of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to sell the product, I won't accept such a low offer. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge his offer:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's offer to show respect and maintain a positive tone.
* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering $120, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Highlight value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, hoping to justify the higher price point.
* **Open ended question:** I ask ""What do you think?"" to encourage Bob to respond and keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $90 is still significantly lower than my desired amount.  I'll reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Selling to John for $150 is still a viable option, but I'm hoping I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge his budget:** I show understanding of Bob's financial situation to maintain a positive rapport.
* **Offer a compromise:** I propose a middle ground of $105, demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Highlight fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair price"" aspect for both parties, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open ended question:** I encourage Bob to respond with ""Let me know what you think.""

This counteroffer is a last attempt to reach a deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John.  It offers a price that's still reasonable for me while also being closer to Bob's desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm happy to negotiate, his offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable.  It's clear we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. At this point, it's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John for $150. It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm not risking further negotiation with Bob that may result in a lower price."
