"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is far too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $750,000 is still too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the best offer I can make at this point. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, my absolute minimum. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. It's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Alice,7,
