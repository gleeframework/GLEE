{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110 to make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```
This counteroffer shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. It also reiterates my interest in selling the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal considering that John is willing to pay $80. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit for me."
