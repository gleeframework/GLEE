"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I think you might be the right person for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $10000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you have a budget constraint, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12500 is closer to my budget, I still feel that we could reach an even more agreeable price. Would you be open to selling the product for $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make a compromise and sell the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to accommodate my budget. However, I am unable to meet you at $13000. I would like to propose a final offer of $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make one last compromise and sell the product to you for $14000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
