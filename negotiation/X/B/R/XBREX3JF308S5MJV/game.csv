"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can do $820,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $820,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $750,000. Would you be open to meeting in the middle at that amount?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer it to you for $840,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",840000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly to $780,000 to find a compromise.  This seems like a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see the value in your offer, but I still need to make a bit more than $780,000. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",860000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but that price point is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one last offer at $800,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to ensure it aligns with my budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I've already told you that I'm not willing to go below $860,000. I'm not going to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you at $800,000, but I'm not going to compromise further. This is my last chance to sell to you, and I'm not willing to lose the sale. What do you do now?",800000.0,Alice,9,
