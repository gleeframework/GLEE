"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $925000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. Can you consider my new offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $925000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $975000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's my final offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of $950000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one more time. Can you consider my new offer?",950000.0,Bob,6,
