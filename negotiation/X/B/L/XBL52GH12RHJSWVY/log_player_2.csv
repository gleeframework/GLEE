"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is more than your maximum budget, and you can get the product from John for $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

I'm offering Alice $7,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and still within my budget.  I believe it's a fair price considering my willingness to purchase from John for $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above my budget, but closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm offering Alice $8,500.  This is a compromise, a bit higher than my ideal price but still lower than her last offer. I'm hoping she'll see that I'm serious about buying and that this is a reasonable price for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, and I'm confident John will sell me the product at that price.  I don't want to risk going back and forth with Alice any longer and potentially exceeding my budget."
