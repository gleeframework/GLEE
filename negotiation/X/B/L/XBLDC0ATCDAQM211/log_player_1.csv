"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** A $12,000 price allows for potential compromise and a win-win scenario for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open and avoid any early roadblocks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John's offer as a backup gives me leverage and allows me to hold out for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but also making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving. 
* **Middle Ground:** $10,250 is the exact midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how it will be beneficial to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob is moving closer, $9,000 is still far from my minimum of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for Improvement:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  John's offer provides a strong safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference this time.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and provides a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer yet, as it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm making a counter-offer by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still holding onto a higher price.
* **Value Focus:** I'm reiterating the product's value and how this price benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a fair compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is getting closer, $9,500 is still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, given John's offer provides a safety net.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** I'm holding out for a better deal, knowing that selling to John is always an option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still below my minimum. Let's meet halfway again - I'm willing to go down to $9,750. This is a fair compromise and will allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise, but still holding out for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by suggesting a quick closing of the deal. This might encourage Bob to accept a slightly higher price."
