"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11500?  That gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11500 is a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? I'm willing to pay that price, but I don't think I can go any higher.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11400. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good deal.",11400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11400 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $11000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value. Can you meet me at this price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I hear you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to drop my price to $11100. This is a good compromise, and hopefully, we can finally close this deal.",11100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $10800? I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal at this price.",10800.0,Bob,8,
