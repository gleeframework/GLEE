"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm  firmly at $9,500.  I really want this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250. That's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,250, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be at $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",10750.0,Alice,7,
