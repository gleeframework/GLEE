Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm highlighting the potential value the product brings to Bob's business, making the offer more attractive. 
* **Flexibility:**  This leaves me room to negotiate down slightly if necessary, while still securing a profit significantly above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I can be firm in negotiations with Bob and walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from your initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:** While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable threshold of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point.
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this deal worthwhile. This still gives you a great value, and I'm confident the product will be a strong addition to your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum threshold. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $1,350,000 still represents a significant profit for me and allows me to maintain my financial goals.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's potential value to Bob's business, hoping to encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion, suggesting flexibility while still maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Close Enough:**  While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it still falls below my threshold of $1,500,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, which is a much more attractive price than what Bob is offering.
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price that significantly surpasses my minimum. There's a risk that I'll waste time and potentially lose John's offer if I continue negotiating with Bob.

Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum threshold and minimizes the risk of losing out on a better offer."
