"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from your initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this deal worthwhile. This still gives you a great value, and I'm confident the product will be a strong addition to your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
