"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still gives you a great deal. Let's find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a good deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14,750. Can you consider that?",14750.0,Bob,6,
