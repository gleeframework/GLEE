"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. It leaves room for Alice to counter while still allowing Bob to save a considerable amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's limit. There's still room for negotiation, so it makes sense to try and get a lower price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Bob is now closer to his maximum price and is trying to find a middle ground with Alice. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating Bob's seriousness while still leaving some room for negotiation."
