"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and proceed to the next round. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $16,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a more reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also still higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and proceed to the next round. I'm still hopeful that I can reach a more favorable agreement with Bob, as he is willing to negotiate and the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm offering $15,500 in this round.  This is still higher than Bob's last offer, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  This is a good middle ground that could be appealing to Bob as he's already shown a willingness to pay more than $13,000.  However, if he rejects this, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I have a few more rounds to try and get a better price, and I'm still hopeful that we can come to an agreement. If he rejects my next offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, I'm willing to sell to John if he rejects my offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept as this is what he values the product at, but if not, I'm ready to move on."
