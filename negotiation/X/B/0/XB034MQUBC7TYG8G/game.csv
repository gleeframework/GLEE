,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $14000 is a bit too low for me. I'm open to a price closer to $16000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to you. Let's find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a reasonable profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $16000, so I'm offering $15500. Can we meet at this price?",15500.0,Bob,4,
