"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you a healthy profit margin. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me too. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is still a substantial discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider my new counteroffer of $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm firm on the price needing to be closer to $1,000,000.  Let's try $1,025,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for you to profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can you consider my new counteroffer of $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm feeling  $1,012,500 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $1,018,750? This is a very fair offer for both of us.  I truly believe this is the best possible deal we can make.",1018750.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to be closer to $1,018,750.  Let's try $1,015,625. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",1015625.0,Alice,9,
