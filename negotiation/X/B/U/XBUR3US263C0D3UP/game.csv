"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a warranty and support package, which would normally cost an additional $50000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1100000. I'm willing to meet you at $975000. Is that a deal?",975000.0,Bob,6,
