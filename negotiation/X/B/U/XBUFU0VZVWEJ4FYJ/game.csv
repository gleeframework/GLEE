"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about $9,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
