"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This still leaves room for both of us to gain from this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $875,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",875000.0,Bob,4,
