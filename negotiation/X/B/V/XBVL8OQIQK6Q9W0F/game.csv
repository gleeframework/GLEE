"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I do see value in this product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, I'm looking for a number closer to $18,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",14000.0,Bob,4,
