Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $60?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but $60 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you a price of $120. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $120 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle on $80? It's a fair deal for both of us."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is the minimum you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already come down significantly from my initial offer of $180. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you a price of $110. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $110.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll budge significantly. We have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $80, our target price. It makes more financial sense to take the sure thing and save the $30."
