"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $11000. This is still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $11000. How about we try $9500? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be firm, but $9500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10500, which is a significant compromise on my end. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get a great value. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10500. I'm willing to meet you at $10200. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",10200.0,Bob,6,
