Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price might pique Bob's interest while still giving you a profit if he accepts.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time element (""limited time"") can encourage Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. If you want to ensure a sale, offering it at $100 (his value) would guarantee it, but you'd make less profit. This offer attempts to balance profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
