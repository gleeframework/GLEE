"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a significant investment, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
