"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $16,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
