"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're continuing to discuss the price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is closer to the value I believe the product holds. I'm willing to make a slight concession to get a deal done, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
