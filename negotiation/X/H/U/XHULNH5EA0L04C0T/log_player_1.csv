"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's still lower than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and open:** The message is friendly and conveys a willingness to work with Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By explicitly saying I'm open to negotiation, I avoid making the initial offer feel like a take-it-or-leave-it proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  While $90 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $100. 
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not afraid to continue negotiating and signals my belief that the product is worth more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John would be a safe option, but it's a lower price.  I'm willing to take the chance that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to the middle ground we were looking for."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but not giving up too much of my desired price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us to create a sense of win-win. 
* **Focus on the Middle Ground:**  I'm reiterating the idea of finding a compromise to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  I believe there's still a chance to close the deal at a price closer to $90, which is more profitable.
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and might motivate him to increase his offer.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $80, I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my last offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($85).
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $90 is still a good deal for him, considering the product's worth to him is $120.
* **Fairness:** I'm using the language ""fair profit"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to pay $90. I'm willing to pay $82.50 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While a slightly higher price would be ideal, I'm confident that I can get a better return on my time and effort by accepting this offer and moving on.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $80, but the potential gain of an extra $2.50 with Bob outweighs the risk of further negotiation."
