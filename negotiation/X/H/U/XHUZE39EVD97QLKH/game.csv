"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to come down a bit more.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept a price that low. My final offer is $1,000,000. This reflects the true value of the product and leaves little room for further negotiation.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
