"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $13,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,800. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, you can still potentially get a better deal.  It's worth rejecting her offer and continuing the negotiation to see if you can push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $13,500?  I think this price is fair, given the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you halfway. Considering your offer of $13,500, I'm willing to reduce the price to $13,700. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,700 is very close to your desired price range, and it's likely that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better deal. Accepting this offer is a good compromise that allows you to acquire the product at a reasonable price. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal or ending up with a higher price from John is too high."
