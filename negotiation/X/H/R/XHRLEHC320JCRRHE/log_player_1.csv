Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the upper hand.
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still a gap between my asking price and my minimum acceptable value ($15,000), so there's space for Bob to counteroffer and for us to reach a compromise.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides me with a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't go well, I can always opt to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for a Better Counteroffer:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, it indicates that he's interested in the product. There's a chance that I can persuade him to increase his offer with a counteroffer in the next round. 
* **John as Backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's significantly below what I need to let go of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which still reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $12,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $12,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm not sacrificing too much. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to go above $10,000. Would you be able to meet me at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer, which is far below my minimum acceptable value. Further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a better outcome.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000.  Selling to John guarantees I get the value I need and avoids any further risk of losing money.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While I would prefer to get more than $15,000, selling to John is the best course of action to avoid a significant loss at this point."
