"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's first offer is $110. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between Alice's offer and my maximum price. 
* This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* It gives Alice room to counter if she wants, but I'm hoping she'll accept to avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than my initial counteroffer, but still below my maximum price of $120. It's worth continuing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer to try to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is now offering $115, which is closer to my maximum price of $120. However, I still want to save as much as possible.
* My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise. It's halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer.
*  I believe this shows I'm willing to be flexible while still working towards a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $112.5, which is only $2.5 more than my previous counteroffer of $110.
* We've reached a point where further negotiation may not yield much more savings. 
* It's likely that continuing to reject offers will result in Alice sticking to her price or even increasing it again.
* Buying from John for $120 would be a worse deal. 
* Therefore, accepting Alice's offer for $112.5 is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
