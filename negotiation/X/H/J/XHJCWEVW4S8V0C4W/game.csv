"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, but it still allows me to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, so I'm thinking $1,275,000. Can you consider this price?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $1,312,500. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  What do you say?",1312500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to stick to my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1,200,000.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
