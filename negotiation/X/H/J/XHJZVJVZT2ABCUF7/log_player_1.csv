{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. It also keeps the price comfortably above your minimum acceptable price of $150.  This strategy aims to secure a quick deal with Bob, while still leaving room for bargaining if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
