Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering $1,600,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still getting a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and higher than selling to John.  Further negotiation might result in a better price, but the risk of Bob walking away and me being left with only John's offer is too high."
