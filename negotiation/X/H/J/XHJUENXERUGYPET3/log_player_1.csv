"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really like the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product!  $140 is a bit too low for me though.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  How about that?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $150.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, so I will accept it. It's better than selling to John for the same price, and it avoids further negotiation."
