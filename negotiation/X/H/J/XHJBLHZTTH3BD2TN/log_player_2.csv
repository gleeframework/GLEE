"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $95. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to anchor the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. While it's unlikely Alice will accept $70 outright (as it's less than her perceived value), it leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer of $70, the value of this product is considerably higher. Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation before reaching my $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. How about $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Splits the Difference:** This offer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($85) and my previous counteroffer ($70). 
* **Staying Below Limit:**  It keeps me below my $80 maximum and leaves a little wiggle room for a final compromise.
* **Shows Willingness:** By increasing my offer, I demonstrate that I'm serious about reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this item.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $82? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting very close to her own valuation, and I'm running the risk of her backing out if I push too hard. Accepting at $82 gets me the product below John's price and avoids the risk of losing out altogether."
