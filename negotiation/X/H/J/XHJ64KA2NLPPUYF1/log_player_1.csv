Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity for you to [briefly mention a benefit the product provides]. I'm asking for $950,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** Briefly mentioning a benefit (without revealing too much)  piques Bob's interest and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Open ended question:** Ending with an open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Can you consider meeting me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $875,000 is getting closer. To make this work for me, I need to be at $890,000.

Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $890000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $880000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of reaching an agreement with Bob decreases significantly.
* **Close to my target:**  $880,000 is only $10,000 away from my desired price of $890,000. This is a reasonable compromise.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a much better price."
