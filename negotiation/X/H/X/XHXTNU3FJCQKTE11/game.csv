"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal at this price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
