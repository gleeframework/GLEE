"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential budget.  If he's truly interested, he may counteroffer. If not, I can move on to John and secure my minimum value."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my goal by continuing the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,850,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's last offer. I believe this might be a sweet spot where we can reach an agreement."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's only $50,000 below my initial asking price and significantly higher than my minimum value.  We've reached a compromise, and it's important to secure the sale before I run out of rounds or risk losing the deal entirely."
