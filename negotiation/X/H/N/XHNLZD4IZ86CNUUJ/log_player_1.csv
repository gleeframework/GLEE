**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increments are getting smaller, and he seems unlikely to meet Alice's minimum price of $1,500,000.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob stalling or not reaching an acceptable offer. Selling to John guarantees Alice her desired minimum price with no further negotiation risk."
