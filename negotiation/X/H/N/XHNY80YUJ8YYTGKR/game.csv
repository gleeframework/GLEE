"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given its value to both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given its value to both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  It's a significant investment for me, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $890,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",890000.0,Alice,7,
