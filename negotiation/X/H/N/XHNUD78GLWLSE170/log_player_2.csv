"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that could be extremely valuable for your business. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $2000000. I understand this is a significant investment, so I encourage you to consider the potential upside. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this could be a mutually beneficial partnership. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's always better to reject an offer that's too high and explore other options, like buying from John at a more affordable price."
