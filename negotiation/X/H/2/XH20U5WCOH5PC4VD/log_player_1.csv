Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is still a significant amount, it's far below the product's worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to sell for less than what it's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about $1,000,000? It's a significant value for you, and it's a reasonable price for me. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $950,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant amount, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
