"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a price significantly higher than my minimum.  I believe this is a strong opening offer that balances maximizing my potential profit with the need to keep Bob engaged."
