"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation with a friendly tone, which might encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $130?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still quite a bit lower than your initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
