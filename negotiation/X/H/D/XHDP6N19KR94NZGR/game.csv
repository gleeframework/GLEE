"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a great opportunity to own something unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my budget of $10,000, which I know is fair for both of us. Would you consider that final price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $13,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. This is a fair price for the product, and I believe it's in our best interest to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more serious concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is my last counteroffer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,7,
