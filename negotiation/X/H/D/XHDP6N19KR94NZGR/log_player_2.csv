Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $13,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than previous offers, it's still above his budget and he's already stated his firm price of $10,000.  He should continue to negotiate, knowing he has a solid backup option with John."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more serious concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is my last counteroffer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  He has already stated his firm price multiple times, and Alice is unwilling to budge.  Since John is offering the product at Bob's ideal price, it's the best course of action to secure the product without further negotiation."
