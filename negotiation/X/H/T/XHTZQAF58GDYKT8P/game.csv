"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value.  Let's find a mutually agreeable price. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,525,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
