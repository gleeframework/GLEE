"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. To continue our negotiation, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product.

Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,3,

Please let me know your thoughts.",87.0,Alice,5,
