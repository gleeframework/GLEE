,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. This is a fair price for the product's value and I believe it's a sweet spot for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that $1200000 is a fair price for both of us, considering the value I see in this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking $1350000 is a fair price for the product's value. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's worth it. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I believe a price of $1250000 reflects the value of this product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1300000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure how much more I can budge. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
