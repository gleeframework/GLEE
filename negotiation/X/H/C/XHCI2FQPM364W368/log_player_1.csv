{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where you are still earning a profit (more than your minimum of $100), but it leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to his value of the product ($80), it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. It's worth trying to push for a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum price, it's still below $100. Since John is willing to pay your minimum price, it's a better option to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation."
