"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however,  $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,950,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which I think is a fair price for this product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
