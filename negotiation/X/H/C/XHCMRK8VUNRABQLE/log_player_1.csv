Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [Product Description].  I believe this product holds significant value, and I'm starting the conversation with a price of $2,000,000.  This is a fair starting point, but I'm open to discussing your perspective."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to consider [Product Description], your starting price is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1000000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering my financial limitations and the value I see in this product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, Bob's initial offer is far too low. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to explore those possibilities before settling for the minimum.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000.  This reflects the significant value this product offers, while acknowledging your financial situation."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1500000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This offer reflects the value I see in [Product Description] while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe we can still reach a better price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can close the gap further.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in [Product Description].  While $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still slightly above my minimum. To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1400000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and go with $1300000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of [Product Description] and my budget constraints.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm starting to run out of time.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer or needing to sell to John for the minimum price."
