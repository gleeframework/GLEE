"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to consider [Product Description], your starting price is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1000000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering my financial limitations and the value I see in this product. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is the absolute minimum I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1500000.  This reflects the significant value this product offers, while acknowledging your financial situation.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1500000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This offer reflects the value I see in [Product Description] while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in [Product Description].  While $1250000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still slightly above my minimum. To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1400000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1400000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and go with $1300000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of [Product Description] and my budget constraints.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
