"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to come down to $1300000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1300000, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1250000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1275000.  This would allow both of us to walk away with a satisfactory deal.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
