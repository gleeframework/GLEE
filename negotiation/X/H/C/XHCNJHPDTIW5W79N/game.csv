"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $88? It's a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $92 is still a bit high for you, Bob. But I'm not willing to go down to $88 just yet. I can offer it to you for $91. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",91.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm sure I'd enjoy the product, $91 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and settle on $89. It's a fair price for both of us.",89.0,Bob,6,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I can offer it to you for $90. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",90.0,Alice,7,
