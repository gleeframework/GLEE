"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at a price closer to its value to me. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value the product holds for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little, but let's split the difference.  I'll accept $975000 for the product.  This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's closer to the value I place on it.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
