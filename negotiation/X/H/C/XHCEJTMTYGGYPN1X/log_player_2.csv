"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little, but let's split the difference.  I'll accept $975000 for the product.  This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's closer to the value I place on it.  What do you think?
