"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. It's worth exploring the negotiation process further before resorting to buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range where a deal is potentially possible. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than my ideal price, but I'm still confident that I can negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to keep exploring the negotiation process to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a better price than her last offer.  I'm hoping that this offer will be close enough to her minimum acceptable price to entice her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but I'm still confident that I can negotiate a lower price. We're getting closer, and I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and should be close enough to her minimum acceptable price to encourage her to accept.  If she rejects, we're getting close to the point where buying from John might be the better option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds. Alice's offer is back to her initial price, and while I could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to buy from John at a higher price is becoming too great.  It's better to secure the product now, even at a slightly higher cost, than to risk getting nothing."
