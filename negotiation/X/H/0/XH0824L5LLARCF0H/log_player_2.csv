"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You can potentially get a better price by counteroffering. There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower to close the deal, especially since she values the product at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $7,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good price.  It's a reasonable starting point, considering my maximum budget and Alice's valuation. If she rejects this, we can continue negotiating, but I'm confident that this offer will get her attention and potentially lead to a quick deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,400, which is only $400 more than my initial counteroffer and a significant saving compared to the initial price or buying from John.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal, and the risk of losing the deal is higher.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept."
