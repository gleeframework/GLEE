"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to my business.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I think we can do better than $10,500. I'm making a concession, but I still need to make a profit. This is my final offer for now.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a significant compromise on my end. I'm confident this product will be a valuable addition to my business, and this price reflects that.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is as low as I can go and still make a profit. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",11250.0,Alice,7,
