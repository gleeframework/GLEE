,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $95? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. Let's meet in the middle on this one, and we can both walk away happy.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about we meet at $108? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
