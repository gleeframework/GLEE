"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $1,300,000 to start negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,300,000, I'm setting a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even though it's more than he values the product for, it makes subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While my goal is to maximize profit, I'm aware I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John.  This gives me leverage to walk away from a bad deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. Bob's counter-offer suggests he's seriously interested, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $150,000 from my initial price. This shows Bob I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm still holding firm above the $1,000,000 mark, as this is my absolute minimum.  
* **Justifying the Price:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm reminding Bob why it's worth a premium price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is decreasing, and he seems anchored below my $1,000,000 minimum. It's unlikely he'll bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds.  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, so it's more profitable to take that deal than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
