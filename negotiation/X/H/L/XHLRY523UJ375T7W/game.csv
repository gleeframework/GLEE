"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $15,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $15,000. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
