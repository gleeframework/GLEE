"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly less than what I'd receive from another buyer. While I value it at no less than $1,500,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as you mentioned you'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Consider it a chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
