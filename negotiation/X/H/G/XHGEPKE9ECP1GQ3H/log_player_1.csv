"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer in a positive way to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm asking for his opinion to start the conversation and potentially get him thinking about the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a high offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. This will help me decide if I should continue negotiating with him or sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob has shown interest, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Maintaining my position:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to explore if I can secure a higher price. Selling to John is always an option, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $13,000? This would still allow me to make a decent profit while also giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Reasonable counteroffer:**  $13,000 is a more reasonable price than my initial offer and is still above Bob's valuation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us by emphasizing the ""good deal"" and the possibility of making a ""decent profit.""

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. By offering a compromise, I'm showing flexibility and potentially encouraging Bob to accept. However, I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13000. How about $12200? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $12,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:** We're already in the 4th round, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** There's a risk that Bob might become less interested or decide to walk away if I reject his offer again.

**Strategy:**

While I'd ideally get closer to my initial goal of $15,000, accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and secures a sale. It's a calculated risk, but given the limited time and potential for a stalemate, it's the most sensible option at this point."
