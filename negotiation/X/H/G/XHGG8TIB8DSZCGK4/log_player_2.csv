# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be of great value to your business. I'm offering you a product that I know you'd find highly beneficial, and I'm confident it would exceed your expectations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a price that will be mutually beneficial. Let's discuss this further and explore the potential of this product for your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
