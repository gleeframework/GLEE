Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's our guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob values the product at $120, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more. Offering it at $149 leaves a small window for him to negotiate, but keeps us firmly above our minimum.
* **Time Value:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we haven't lost anything. We can immediately sell to John at our desired price."
