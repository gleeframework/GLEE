"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the value of the product to me. I'll see if Bob is interested in this price or if I need to adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept Bob's offer right away. He's starting at the lowest possible price. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering $15,000. This is a good compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball offer. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a fair price and is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal. While it's not my initial asking price, it's closer to my desired price point and higher than John's offer.  I'll accept the deal to avoid further negotiation."
