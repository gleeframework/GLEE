"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $1000000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's a fair compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $900000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875000. Can we meet in the middle?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to come down to $885000. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it for this amazing product. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. That's my final offer.,875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $890000. This is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",890000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm afraid $890000 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $875000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",875000.0,Bob,8,
