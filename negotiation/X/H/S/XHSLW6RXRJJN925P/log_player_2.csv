"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's opening offer is at your maximum price.** This means there's potential for a better deal.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** You can start counter-offering and explore if Alice is willing to lower the price.
* **Buying from John immediately is not advantageous.** You have 10 rounds, and John's offer is your safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's unique qualities, I'm aiming to stay within a specific budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering my budget and the opportunity to acquire such a unique item."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counter:**  The counteroffer is a 20% reduction from Alice's initial price, which is a significant drop but still shows you are serious about the deal.
* **Focus on budget:** Highlighting your budget constraints puts pressure on Alice to compromise while also establishing a clear bargaining position.
* **Emphasize value:**  Reminding Alice of the product's unique qualities strengthens your position and suggests you are willing to pay a fair price, but within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value is higher than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **You have leverage.** Alice has already rejected your offer, indicating she is willing to negotiate further.
* **There's room for a better deal.** You have several rounds left and can continue to push for a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is unnecessary.**  There's still potential for a better price from Alice, and you have a backup option if negotiations fail."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still slightly above my budget. Given the product's unique qualities and my desire to acquire it, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.

I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

* **A small price difference:** The difference between Alice's offer and your budget is minimal, making it reasonable to accept.
* **John's offer is your safety net:** If you reject Alice's offer, you can still buy from John for $1,200,000, ensuring you get the product.

**Conclusion:**
