Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. While Bob's value is lower, this opens the negotiation with a strong position. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly implies the price is justified without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $200,000 below your minimum provides room for Bob to potentially negotiate upwards while still ensuring you receive a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer (John) as Leverage:** While not explicitly stated, the knowledge that you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you a strong fallback position if Bob rejects the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by:

1. Potentially securing a deal above your minimum with Bob.
2. If Bob declines, you have John as a secure backup."
