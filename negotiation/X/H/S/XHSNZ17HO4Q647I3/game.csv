"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000.  This is a great price, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement quickly. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  The value of this product is clear, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  How about we split the difference and I accept $1,100,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and allows us both to come away happy.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,087,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,062,500? This is a fair price for me, and I think it's a good compromise.",1062500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However,  $1,062,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle for $1,075,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $1,060,000? This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,8,
