{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You have 10 rounds to reach an agreement, so rejecting the offer and starting the counteroffer process is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since my maximum budget is $10,000, I'm starting with the lowest possible offer. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate down from her initial price.  This sets a clear boundary and lets Alice know I'm serious about buying the product but not willing to pay above my budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above my budget, but it's closer than her first offer.  I'm going to continue negotiating.  There's a chance I might be able to get a better deal by rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer.  We have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $10,500.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still within my budget. It's a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's most recent offer.  Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for Alice to accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $10,750. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  With each round, we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price.  This offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. I'm confident that Alice will accept this offer or come back with a counteroffer that's closer to my price."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to my budget, I'm going to try one more counteroffer. We have 3 rounds left and I believe I can push for a price that's just a little lower. The goal is to get the best possible price and avoid going over my $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer one last time to $10,800. This is a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to save some money.  I believe this is a fair offer that shows Alice I am serious about purchasing the product but am also trying to get the best price possible.  With only two rounds remaining, I'm hoping this will be the final offer and we can reach an agreement."
