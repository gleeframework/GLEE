"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $13,000, knowing it's likely Bob will reject this. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if he's truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer to keep negotiating. I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,500.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my goal.  I'm also keeping an eye on selling to John, as that's a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $11,000.  This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation and keeps me closer to my minimum value. I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed option with John at $12,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject and make another counteroffer. It's getting late in the game, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm also still aware of the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

I'm dropping my price to $10,900. This is a slight decrease from my last offer, showing I'm flexible, but it's still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to close the deal, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  With only two rounds left, the risk of not finding a deal is too high.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
