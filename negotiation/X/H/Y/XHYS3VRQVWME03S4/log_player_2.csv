"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,000 
* **John's Price:** $10,000 

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay John $10,000, but you're still within your budget and have the product.  It's possible Alice might lower her price if you reject her first offer."
