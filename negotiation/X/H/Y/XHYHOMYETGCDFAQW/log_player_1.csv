Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values it at $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing your profit.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The price is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($10,000). 
* **John as Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum."
