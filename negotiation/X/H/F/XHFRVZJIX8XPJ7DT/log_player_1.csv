Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to offer $1500000 for it. Let me know what you think.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still out of my price range.  I'm really only comfortable going up to $1575000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you're coming down, but $1587500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1550000 one more time. This is truly my final offer, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.
