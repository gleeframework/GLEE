"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1500000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to make this deal work. How about $1650000?  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a smart investment for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1650000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1550000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the most I can offer at this time.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1587500?  It's just a slight adjustment from your last offer, and it's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",1587500.0,Alice,7,
