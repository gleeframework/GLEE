Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have the advantage of knowing Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $12,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a profit above your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that. 
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer sets the stage for potential counter-offers from Bob, giving you the chance to maximize your profit."
