"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a discounted price of $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as I can still make a profit and you can get the product for a price that's less than its worth to you. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,1,
