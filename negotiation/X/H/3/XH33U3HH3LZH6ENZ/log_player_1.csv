""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below John's price ($145) makes it more appealing to Bob while still securing a profit above Bob's valuation.

This offer aims to strike a balance between a price Bob might accept and a price that maximizes your profit."
