"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable offer:** It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear message:** It states the price upfront and invites Bob to respond. 
* **It emphasizes the value to Bob:** Reminding him of the product's value to him can help make the offer more appealing.

Remember, it's a negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and keep an eye on the clock to ensure you get the best deal possible!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:**  While $130 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, as the product is worth more to Bob. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll prepare a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial $140 offer, while acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is a bit lower than where I'd like to be, but I'm open to finding common ground. How about $135? That's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Reasonable midpoint:** $135 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of this offer for both of us.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm showing that I'm serious about making a deal. However, by sticking to a price higher than my minimum, I'm still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, so how about $132.50? That's my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $132.50 is only $2.50 below my initial offer and only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, and time is running out. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or a lower price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While this is Bob's ""final offer,"" there's always the potential for more negotiation in later rounds. However, it's not a guarantee.

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a relatively good deal while limiting the risk of getting a lower price or losing the deal altogether."
