(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer but still keeping it significantly below Alice's current offer. This shows he's willing to compromise but still wants a good deal. The counteroffer is high enough to potentially be attractive to Alice, but also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob can still try to negotiate further, as there's a significant gap between Alice's offer and John's price. He can aim for a price closer to his maximum budget, potentially leading to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget with this counteroffer, but still leaving room for a potential compromise. This offer is a strong indication that he is serious about buying the product but won't overpay. It's high enough to be tempting for Alice, especially considering the decreasing offers. It also increases the pressure on Alice to accept, or risk losing a potential buyer to John."
