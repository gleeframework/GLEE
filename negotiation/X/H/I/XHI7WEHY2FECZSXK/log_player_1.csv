I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I hope this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I don't want to sell it to Bob at a huge loss.  I'll make one more attempt to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $14,000.  This is closer to my minimum value but I'm hoping it's enticing enough for Bob to finally accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John at my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  His counteroffer is too low, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'll sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than accepting Bob's offer and losing a significant amount of money."
