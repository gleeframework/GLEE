{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more to you, so I'm sure you'll find this a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also highlights the value to Bob, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a little high for me.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a good price, it's still below the desired $100.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $95?  That would be a good deal for both of us, and it's still less than what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be.  How about $92?  That's a good price for both of us and keeps the deal moving. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $95, Bob is clearly willing to pay a bit more than his initial offer.  Accepting $92 is a good compromise and ensures a sale without risking a further decline in price."
