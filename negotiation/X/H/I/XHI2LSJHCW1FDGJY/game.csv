"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I have to say that $7500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $8250? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $7750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $7750. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we try $8100? I think that's as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",8100.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about buying the product. How about we try $8050? If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",8050.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've made several concessions already, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final offer, though. How about we meet at $8100? If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",8100.0,Alice,9,
