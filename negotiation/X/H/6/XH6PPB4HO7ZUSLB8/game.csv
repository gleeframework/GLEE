"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9000. This reflects the value of the product while giving you a good price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8750? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $8875? I'm eager to finalize this deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us. ",8875.0,Alice,5,
