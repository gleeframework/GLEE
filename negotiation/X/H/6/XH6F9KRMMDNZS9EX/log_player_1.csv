Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special introductory price of $200. It's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $120 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $200, but $180 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll try $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. It's more profitable to sell to John for $150 than to continue haggling with Bob."
