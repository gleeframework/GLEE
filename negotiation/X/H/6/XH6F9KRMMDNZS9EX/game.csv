"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $120 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $200, but $180 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll try $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",140.0,Bob,4,
