"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm looking for something closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000.  Perhaps we can meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
