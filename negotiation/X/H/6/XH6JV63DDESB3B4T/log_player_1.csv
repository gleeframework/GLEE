{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  This approach allows for a potential win-win situation where I get a good price, and Bob acquires a valuable asset at a reasonable cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can secure a better deal by engaging in further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
