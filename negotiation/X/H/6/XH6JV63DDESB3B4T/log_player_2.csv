# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation of the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Even though there's a potential for further negotiation, Bob doesn't want to risk getting stuck in a lengthy back-and-forth with Alice. Buying from John ensures a guaranteed purchase within Bob's budget, saving time and potential frustration."
