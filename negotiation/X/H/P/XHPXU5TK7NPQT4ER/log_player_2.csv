"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is still above your target of $1,500,000.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **John is a fallback option.**  You have the option of buying from John, but his price is your absolute maximum. You want to try to beat his price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, I'm currently only able to offer $1,200,000. This reflects my budget and the value I see in the product at this stage. I'm open to further discussions to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Clear Justification:** The message explains your reasoning behind the counteroffer, emphasizing your budget and perceived value. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message indicates a willingness to continue discussing the price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer places you in a better negotiating position for the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 falls short of what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a step in the right direction, $1,300,000 is still above your target price of $1,500,000. You want to continue negotiating for a lower price.
* **Continuing negotiations could yield a better deal.**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price.
* **John remains a viable alternative.** You can still purchase from John, so you are not under immense pressure to accept Alice's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:** This offer is a smaller step towards Alice's price, showing a willingness to meet halfway while still pushing for a lower price.

* **Demonstrating Serious Interest:** The message highlights your genuine interest in the product, but with a clear price point. This creates a sense of urgency without being too aggressive. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer sets the stage for potential agreement in the next few rounds. It puts pressure on Alice to either accept or come down further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I see you're serious about this purchase. To avoid prolonging this, I'll come down slightly.  Let's settle this at $1,275,000. This is my final offer, Bob.
