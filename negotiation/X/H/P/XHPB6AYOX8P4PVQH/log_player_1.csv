**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, he's doing so in smaller increments. It's unlikely he will reach a price close enough to your $1,000,000 valuation within the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It makes more sense to cut your losses and take the guaranteed offer at this point."
