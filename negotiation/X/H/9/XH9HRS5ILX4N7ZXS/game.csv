"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and gives you a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
