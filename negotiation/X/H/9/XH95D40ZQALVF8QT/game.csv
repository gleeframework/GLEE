"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $250 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $180 for the product?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $180 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? ",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $130 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $170?",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $170 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $150?  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",150.0,Bob,6,
