"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiations at $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product fits into my budget closer to $900,000.  Would that work for you?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I can do $1,050,000. That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my strong interest in this product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can compromise a bit further, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been carefully considering my options, and to be completely transparent, I've also found a similar product for $1,200,000. I value what you're offering, and I'm willing to offer you $1,125,000 to make this deal happen. This is a strong offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about the similar product, Bob. I understand that you have options, but I believe my product is unique and worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,125,000 and my minimum of $1,500,000. I can offer it to you for $1,312,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1312500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, I need to be realistic with my budget. I can make this work with $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, and it allows me to get this unique product while staying within my limits.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $1,400,000. If you can't meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. This is my final counteroffer.",1400000.0,Alice,9,
