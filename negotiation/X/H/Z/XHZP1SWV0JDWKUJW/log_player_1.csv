"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows for room to negotiate down and still potentially get a good price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message by being open to discussion, encouraging Bob to respond.

**Remember:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the negotiation going with Bob for as long as possible to potentially get a better offer than John's."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1200000. This is a fair price given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to close the deal, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. 

By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price from Bob, or I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling it to you for $1,400,000. This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing that it's too low.  
* **Lower Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging further negotiations. 
* **Common Ground:** I'm suggesting a ""solution that works for both of us"" to emphasize that I'm willing to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This reflects the value of the product to me while allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price, but I'm not willing to accept anything below my minimum. 

I'm still within the 10-round limit, so I have more room to negotiate without losing out on the guaranteed price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,300,000 is still too far below what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,350,000. This price allows for a good margin for both of us and shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for everyone. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but reiterate that his offer is still too low.
* **Middle Ground:** I propose a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and his last offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I emphasize a good margin for both of us and commitment to finding a solution. 
* **Direct Question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still outside my budget.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1250000. This is a fair price that allows for a good margin for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm still within a comfortable range to continue negotiating. Selling to John would guarantee my desired price, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob.

I'm confident that I can either reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob in the next few rounds or still sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,250,000 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it's worth more. To show my willingness to find a solution, I'm willing to offer you a final price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:** I'm setting a tone of finality by stating this is my ""final price."" This increases the pressure on Bob.
* **Value Reiteration:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my position.
* **Win-Win:** I emphasize that the price is ""fair for both of us"" to encourage acceptance.
* **Urgency:** I end with a call to action to push for a decision.

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiations. This offer is still within a reasonable range for both of us, and it increases the pressure on Bob to accept. It also sets me up for the option of selling to John if Bob continues to reject the offer."
