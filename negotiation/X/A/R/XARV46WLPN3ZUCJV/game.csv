"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'd be willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $12,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our needs.",12500.0,Bob,4,
