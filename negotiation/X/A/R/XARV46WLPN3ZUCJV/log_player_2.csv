"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offering process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'd be willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to secure a fair price.  The message is friendly and provides a reason for the lower offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can still likely negotiate a lower price.  Alice is willing to negotiate, so there's an opportunity to get closer to Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $12,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer, but still maintaining a price point that is lower than Alice's.  The message emphasizes a desire for compromise and a fair price for both parties. This strategy aims to encourage Alice to accept the offer and close the deal."
