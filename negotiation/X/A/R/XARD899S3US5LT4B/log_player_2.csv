Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $90? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90. While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John at $80 guarantees the best price and avoids potential further back-and-forth."
