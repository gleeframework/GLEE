"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. How about we start with a price of $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind and I'd like to stay within it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $105. How about we try $95? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to stay as close to my budget as possible.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $102.50? I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a decent profit.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit above $102.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to try $97.50. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $97.50. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $101.25? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",101.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a sweet spot, but I'm starting to think that $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time, but I'd like to try $98. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us, but I need to stay within my budget.",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $100.50? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",100.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $99, but no lower. I've already stretched my budget to the limit, and I need to make a decision soon. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",99.0,Bob,10,
