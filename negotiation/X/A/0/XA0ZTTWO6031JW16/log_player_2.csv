"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $13,000, which is still a good deal for Alice (above her value of $12,000) but saves Bob $1,000 compared to Alice's initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is closer to John's price, making it less appealing. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Even though it might be risky to go for another round of counteroffers, it's worth trying to get a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is raising his counteroffer slightly to $13,500. This is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. It's still a good deal for Alice, but it allows Bob to potentially get a better price than the $14,500 she's offering."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is now equal to John's price. There's no incentive to continue negotiating with Alice, as Bob won't get a better price.  He's better off buying from John, as he has a guaranteed price and can avoid further negotiation."
