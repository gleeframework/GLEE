Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $850,000? I think this reflects a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price. While $850,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly less than what I want for the product."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm glad you've made an effort to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering my budget constraints, I propose $860,000 as a counteroffer. It's a slight adjustment from your last proposal, aiming for a win-win situation. Please let me know what you think.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $860,000 is getting pretty close to what I consider a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept his offer."
