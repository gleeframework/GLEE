"Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll see its worth once you start using it.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. This is the absolute limit of what I can pay. Let's make a deal and move forward.",10000.0,Bob,8,
