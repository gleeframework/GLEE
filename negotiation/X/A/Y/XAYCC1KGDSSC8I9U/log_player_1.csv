Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but that's significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, this product offers significant value, and I need to ensure a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers relatively slowly.  While he might eventually be willing to go above $1,000,000, it's not guaranteed. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe and immediate way to secure the best possible outcome for Alice."
