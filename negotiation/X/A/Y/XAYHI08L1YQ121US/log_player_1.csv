Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Please let me know your decision as soon as possible."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he'd theoretically be willing to pay anything up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially gives you room to negotiate. A price of $1,100,000 allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal (saving $100,000) while still netting you a significant profit above your minimum.

It's a starting point â€“ you can always adjust downwards if Bob pushes back, but beginning with a strong offer increases your chances of securing a higher final price."
