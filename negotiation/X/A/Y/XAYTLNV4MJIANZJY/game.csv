"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to my business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1050000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  Let's split the difference and go with $1100000. This price is fair, considering the potential of this product for your business.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

Let's close this deal and move forward.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
