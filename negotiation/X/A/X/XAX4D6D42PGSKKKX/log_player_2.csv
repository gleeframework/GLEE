"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $120.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer will allow you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
