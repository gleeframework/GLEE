"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. Given its high value and quality, it's worth $15,000 to you. Considering its exceptional attributes, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $12,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that reflects its true worth while offering you significant savings. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. You know it's worth a maximum of $15,000 to you, but she claims it's inherently worth that much.
* Her offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000. 

By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply proceed to buy from John at a more reasonable price."
