Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This sets a strong starting point and gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I hope to reach a deal in this round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is sticking to his $9,500 offer, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a little closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm lowering my offer to $10,000, which is my absolute minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. If he rejects, I'll sell to John in the next round."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still refusing to budge from his offer, and we are running out of time. I am now only one round away from the final round and still haven't reached my minimum acceptable price. While $9,000 is close, it's not worth the risk.  It's time to sell to John and guarantee a better price."
