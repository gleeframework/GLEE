"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
