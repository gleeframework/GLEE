"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $80, but I believe it's a fair starting point to see what Bob is willing to pay.  If he rejects, we can then negotiate downwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92.  While I would ideally like more, we've reached a point where the negotiations are likely to become more protracted.  Selling to Bob for $92 is a good outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
