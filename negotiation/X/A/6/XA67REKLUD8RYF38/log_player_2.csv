"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal compared to John's price of $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $115? It's still a good price for you, and a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $122.50 is a fair compromise and still significantly cheaper than John's price of $150.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential gains are small, and the risk of Alice rejecting further offers is higher.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
