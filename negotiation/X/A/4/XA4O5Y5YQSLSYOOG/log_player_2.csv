"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more than that to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100.** This is less than your maximum budget of $120.
* **Your value for the product is unknown**, but it is implied to be more than $100 since Alice says it's ""worth a lot more than that to you."" 
* **Buying from John would cost $120.** This is more than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it allows you to purchase the product for a lower price than John's offer."
