"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This price is fair given its value to me, and it allows you to still make a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I'd like to make.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
