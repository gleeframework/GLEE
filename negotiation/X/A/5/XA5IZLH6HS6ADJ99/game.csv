"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm starting with a price of $2000000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. It's a unique opportunity for you to gain a significant advantage. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and give you a substantial discount from my initial offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1750000 is still above my acceptable price point.  I'm happy to go up to $1250000. This would give you a good return and allow me to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. While $1250000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  Let's aim for a truly mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to drop my price to $1600000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a price that will allow both of us to achieve our goals.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement.  However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1350000.  This would be a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  While $1350000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite there.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer the product for $1475000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and allows me to achieve a reasonable return.  Let's close this deal and make this a win-win situation.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $1475000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  Let's try to close this deal with a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
