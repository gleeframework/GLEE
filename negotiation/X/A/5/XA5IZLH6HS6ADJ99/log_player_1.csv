{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I need to see if I can get closer to my desired value by continuing the negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. It's a unique opportunity for you to gain a significant advantage. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and give you a substantial discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Perspective:** I start by acknowledging Bob's budget concerns to show empathy and demonstrate a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I emphasize the product's unique value and the potential benefits it offers to Bob.

* **Middle Ground:** I frame my offer as a compromise and a way to find a solution that benefits both parties."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1750000 is still above my acceptable price point.  I'm happy to go up to $1250000. This would give you a good return and allow me to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement.  However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1350000.  This would be a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.
