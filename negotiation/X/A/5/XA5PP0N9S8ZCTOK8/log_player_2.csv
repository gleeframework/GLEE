"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,000.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range. Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate is the better choice. There's still room for Alice to move closer to Bob's target price, and it's worth exploring that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his ideal price while still leaving room for compromise.  $8,750 is a reasonable counter-offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying firm on the value proposition.  It's likely that Alice will be more receptive to this offer than the previous one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price of $10,000, but it's still not a good deal for him.  The risk of continued negotiation is that Alice could either reject Bob's counteroffers, or she might eventually offer a price that is too close to $10,000 for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.

It's better for Bob to take the certain outcome of buying from John for $10,000, as he knows his maximum price is $10,000 and any further negotiation with Alice could lead to a worse outcome."
