"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $140 is within your budget of $150.
* Accepting this offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal. Accepting the $140 offer is a good compromise between getting a decent price and securing the product."
