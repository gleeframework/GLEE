Alice's offer is now at the price she is willing to sell the product for. This is a good deal for us, as we can buy the product for $1,200,000, saving us $300,000 compared to buying from John.  While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee we can get a better price, and we risk losing the deal to another buyer. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
