Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit of a price gap, but the product is worth a premium. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I'd prefer to get $120, taking $115 from Bob is better than risking him walking away entirely. At this point, the additional profit from John isn't worth the potential loss if negotiations with Bob completely fall through."
