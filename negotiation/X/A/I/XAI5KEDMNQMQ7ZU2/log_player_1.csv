Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John guarantees $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" & ""Limited-Time"":**  These phrases aim to create a sense of scarcity and encourage a quicker decision.

**Outcome Possibilities:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Alice gets $1,100,000 (a great deal).
* **Bob Rejects:** Alice sells to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
