"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, how about $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle on $9,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great value at this price. Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but that's really my absolute limit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $8,900 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000 one last time. This is truly a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!  If not, I'll be forced to pursue other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
