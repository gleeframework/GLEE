"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer positively to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for counteroffers and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** $8,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.
* **Potential for compromise:**  I'm not yet ready to accept Bob's offer, but there's room for negotiation.
* **Ten rounds:**  I have enough rounds to explore other options and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Strategic pricing:** $9,250 is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to my desired price. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, how about $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $8,750 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.
* **Room for improvement:**  I have several rounds remaining and believe I can still get a better price.
* **Time to pressure Bob:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price by showing I'm not willing to settle for much less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle on $9,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great value at this price. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:**  I'm making a smaller concession this time, showing I'm not desperate to close the deal quickly.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize that $9,000 is a fair price.
* **Call to action:**  I'm urging Bob to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $9,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but that's really my absolute limit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $8,900 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000. 
* **Few rounds left:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation. It's important to keep pushing for a better deal, but also be mindful of the remaining rounds. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise. I believe there's still potential to get him closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $8,900 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000 one last time. This is truly a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!  If not, I'll be forced to pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm making a final offer, but this time I'm using a bit of pressure by hinting at selling to John if Bob doesn't accept.
* **Slight concession:**  I'm still offering $9,000, which is slightly above Bob's last offer. 
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Leaving some room:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still choose to sell to John, which would be a better outcome for me."
