{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $925,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still securing a substantial profit for you. This price point leaves room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the deal with Bob and maximizing your potential earnings."
