"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground. He's still willing to pay more than Alice's minimum but wants to save as much as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. Even though Alice has moved closer to his desired price, there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but he's slowly increasing his offer. He's showing flexibility while still aiming to get a good deal. The message also emphasizes finding a price that benefits both parties, which can be a persuasive tactic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has already rejected Alice's previous offers and is getting closer to the price John is offering.  $112.50 is a good compromise, saving him $37.50 compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting the offer to secure the product and avoid the risk of the negotiation falling apart or reaching the 10-round limit."
