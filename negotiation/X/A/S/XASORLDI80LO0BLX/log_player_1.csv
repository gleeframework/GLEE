Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer that I think is reasonable, but not too aggressive. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $850,000}

This is a bit higher than the minimum value I have in mind, but I'm willing to compromise to see if Bob is interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a significant amount. I'll think carefully about my next move.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I don't want to sell the product for $750,000, as I think it's worth more. I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's higher than his offer, but not too aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still reasonable. I'll offer:

{""product_price"": $790,000}

This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still reflects the value I think the product has. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
