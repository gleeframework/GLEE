I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $12,000 to both of us.  I believe this leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with the $12,000 offer, I'm going to try and push for a slightly higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a profit. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
