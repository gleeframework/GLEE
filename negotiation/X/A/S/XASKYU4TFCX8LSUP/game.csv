"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can get this negotiation closed quickly.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
