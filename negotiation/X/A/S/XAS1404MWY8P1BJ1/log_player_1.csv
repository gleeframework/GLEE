Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $1050000.  This is still a good profit for you, and it would be a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1150000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1100000? This would allow me to secure the product while still leaving you with a substantial profit.
