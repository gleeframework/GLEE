"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $1050000.  This is still a good profit for you, and it would be a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1150000. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to my target. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1150000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1100000? This would allow me to secure the product while still leaving you with a substantial profit.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1120000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
