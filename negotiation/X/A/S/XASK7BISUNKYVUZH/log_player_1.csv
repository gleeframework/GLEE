Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum of $120, but leaves room for negotiation since the product is worth $150 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, there's still room to negotiate closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $132 is close enough to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John for $120. I'll accept his offer to maximize my profit."
