"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to establish a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can still sell to John for a much higher price. It's in my best interest to continue the negotiation and see if I can secure a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a small concession, coming down from $12,000 to $11,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm on my minimum price, which is still above Bob's initial offer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to reiterate why this price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I have several rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I can always sell to John for $15,000 if necessary. I'm confident I can push Bob to a higher price or at least make him counteroffer again, giving me more negotiating leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10,500 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference at $11,250. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's. This shows that I'm still open to negotiating, but I'm not willing to go too low. The price is still within my desired range and is closer to my minimum than Bob's offer."
