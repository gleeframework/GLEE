{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm willing to let it go for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's value of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're willing to be flexible.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $135 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150.  I'm going to try and get closer to my goal by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $125 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This is my final offer - I can't go any lower.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
