**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his valuation and is unlikely to go much higher than his $1,250,000 offer. While we could continue negotiating, we risk him dropping his offer further, putting us in a worse position. Selling to John at $1,200,000 guarantees us a fair price without further risk of losing money in a protracted negotiation."
