"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. There's no reason to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking for a price closer to $950,000. This is still a significant profit for you, and it aligns with my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price and can likely get closer to his target. While Alice's offer is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should keep trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, and it's still a significant profit for you. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to reach an agreement, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price and won't go below $1,025,000. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $1,000,000. This saves Bob $25,000 and ensures a quicker deal. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 10 rounds, leaving Bob with no product."
