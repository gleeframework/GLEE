"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush and I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal, keeping in mind that I only have 10 rounds to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product and I appreciate your offer. However, $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, considering your interest.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price if I continue the negotiation.  I'll counter with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $85.  I'm willing to go down to $88 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85, and that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While $85 isn't my ideal price, it's above my minimum and a good deal given the remaining rounds.  It's better to take the offer now than risk losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer of $80."
