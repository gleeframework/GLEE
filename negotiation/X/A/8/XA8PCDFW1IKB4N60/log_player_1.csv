Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (Your value from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 

**Negotiation Strategy**

The key is to find a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves money on the table, while going too low might make Bob suspicious or unwilling to negotiate.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Strong Price Point:**  $1,350,000 is a significant amount above your minimum and gives Bob a $150,000 discount from his perceived value.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting ""return on investment"" appeals to Bob's business sense. 

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer. Have a walk-away point in mind and be willing to compromise slightly if needed.
* **Relationship Matters:**  While maximizing profit is important, consider the long-term value of a good business relationship with Bob.
