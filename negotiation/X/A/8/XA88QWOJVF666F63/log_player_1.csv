Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth $95, and I'm willing to sell it to you at that price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's crucial that the offer is significantly higher than John's $80 offer to avoid Bob lowballing or walking away.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
