You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a price closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product.  How about $1000000?  This allows for a healthy profit for you and gives me a decent return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. However, it's closer to my target price than her initial offer. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a price closer to my target. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to close the gap."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $900,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but $900000 is still not in the ballpark for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $950000.  This price is a fair compromise, allowing you to make a good return while ensuring I don't have to take a huge loss. This is my final offer -  let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, I've already made two counteroffers and it's clear Alice is unlikely to go lower than $950,000. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget, I will purchase it from John for $800,000."
