"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product looks great, but  $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, $675,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $712,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",712500.0,Alice,5,
