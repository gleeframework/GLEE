# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,600,000 is above his maximum budget, and he has a better option with John.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He should counteroffer again and try to push for a lower price."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his ideal price, it's only $25,000 more than what John is offering.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in more back and forth without a better outcome.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product and saves time and effort."
