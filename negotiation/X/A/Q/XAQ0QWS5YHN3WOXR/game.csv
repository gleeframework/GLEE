"Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  $12000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14000.  This is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
