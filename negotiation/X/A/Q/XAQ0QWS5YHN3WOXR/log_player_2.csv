"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17000.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your maximum limit of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  $12000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14000.  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit of $10,000. Since you can get the same product from John for your maximum budget, it's more advantageous to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
