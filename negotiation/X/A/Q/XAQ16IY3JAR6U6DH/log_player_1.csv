Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 to John, there's a chance Bob will pay slightly more.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting high gives room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly.

It's unlikely Bob will accept this price knowing his own valuation. However, it sets the stage for potential negotiation where I can still aim for a price significantly higher than $80."
