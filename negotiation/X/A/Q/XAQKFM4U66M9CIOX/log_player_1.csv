"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'll be watching his reaction to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with accepting Bob's offer right away. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair price and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $125, which is a significant improvement from his initial offer.  While I would ideally prefer a higher price, accepting this offer gives me a decent profit while still keeping the negotiation going with Bob. If I keep rejecting his offers, I risk running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John for $120."
