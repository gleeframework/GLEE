"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than John's price, it's still above Alice's minimum value.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. How about $10,500?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original prices. How about $11,500? It's a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a reasonable compromise, falling within Bob's budget and still allowing Alice to make a profit.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small, and the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially increasing the price is too high."
