"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is still within your budget and leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offer. It's still within your budget and getting closer to your ideal price.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your offer again and potentially raising the price is too high.  It's a better choice to secure the deal at a price you're comfortable with."
