"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $130 is less than your maximum of $150.
* **You save money compared to John:** Buying from Alice saves you $20 compared to buying from John.

While you might be able to negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer is the best strategy in this situation to ensure you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
