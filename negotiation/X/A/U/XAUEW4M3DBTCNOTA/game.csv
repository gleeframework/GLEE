"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind.  I would be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer Alice.  While $18,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm getting closer.  How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise at $16,000. It's a price that I think is fair considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I can tell you're really trying to make this work, and I appreciate that.  Unfortunately, there's just not that much wiggle room left in my budget.  My absolute best offer is $11,500. I understand if that's not possible for you, but I hope we can make a deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
