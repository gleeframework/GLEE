"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $14,000 is decent, there's room for negotiation.  You're willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice is likely willing to accept less than $14,000. By rejecting this initial offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down further in price."
