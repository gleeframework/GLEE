Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it outright. This sets a high starting point and allows for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial $800,000, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. Given the risk of further back and forth, and the fact that John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's the safest option and ensures I get my minimum desired price."
