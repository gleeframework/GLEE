I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can then analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close enough to my desired price point. While I could try to push for a bit more, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely, especially with John offering a guaranteed $1,000,000. It's a good deal, and I'll take it."
