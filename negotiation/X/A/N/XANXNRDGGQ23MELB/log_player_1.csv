Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Offer:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is because I want to maximize my potential profit.
* **Knowing John's Offer:**  I know I can get at least $1,000,000 from John, so I'm aiming for a price higher than that.
* **Uncertainty about Bob's Value:**  I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, so I'm taking a calculated risk with this high offer. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I get the highest possible price and earn a significant profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** I still get a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

**Why This Strategy Makes Sense:**

* **Maximizes Potential Earnings:** The higher the offer, the more potential profit.
* **Minimizes Risk:** Having John's offer as a safety net allows me to take a chance without risking a big loss."
