Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's why:

* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, so he might be willing to pay closer to $1,400,000.
* **Attractive to Bob:** This offer is significantly better than what John will offer you.  Bob has a strong incentive to negotiate with you.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can then use the information from his counteroffer to strategize your next move.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to avoid a situation where you're forced to sell to John at a lower price."
