"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
