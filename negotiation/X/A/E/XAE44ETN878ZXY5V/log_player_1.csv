Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not ready to sell for $1,150,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,225,000? This is a fair compromise considering our respective valuations of the product."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $1,175,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. It's also a better deal for you than going with John, who is willing to pay that exact amount."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,200,000, but I'm still not willing to pay that price. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $1,175,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear he is not willing to go above $1,175,000.  While I can continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on the $1,200,000 offer from John.  It's time to move on and sell to John."
