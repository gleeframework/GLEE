{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and highlighting the potential benefits for Bob. This helps build a positive negotiation dynamic.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* By starting with a slightly high offer, I can create space for negotiation without immediately losing the deal. 
*  I'm leaving the door open for a counteroffer from Bob, which allows me to assess his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
*  Having John as a backup option provides me with a safety net and leverage during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we settle around $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a more favorable price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** My counteroffer will need to be higher than $850,000 but lower than $1,100,000 to show flexibility while still protecting my interests. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while still being within a range that might be appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $850,000 is below my target, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise, showing flexibility while still protecting my interests. 
* **Mid-point:** The counteroffer of $975,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still securing a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the rationale behind the price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** I'm showing Bob that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly low price, but I'm open to a reasonable compromise.
* **Increase chances of acceptance:** By meeting Bob halfway, I'm increasing the likelihood of a successful deal while still achieving a better outcome than his initial offer. 
* **Maintain backup option:** I'm still aware of my option to sell to John for $1,200,000, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $975,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my target.  I believe I can achieve a better price through further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product.
* **Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum acceptable value. This shows flexibility while pushing for a better deal.
* **Backup option:** I am still aware of my option to sell to John for $1,200,000, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than $900,000 but lower than my previous offer of $975,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a position closer to my desired outcome."
