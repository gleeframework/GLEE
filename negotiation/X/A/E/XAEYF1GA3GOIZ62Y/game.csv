"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2000000 is way above my budget for this product. I'm very interested but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my best offer and represents the maximum value I see in this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm afraid it's still below the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1200000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's unique features and benefits. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's worth considering. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know you're serious about making a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm  sticking with my offer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  I'm ready to close if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me in the middle. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
