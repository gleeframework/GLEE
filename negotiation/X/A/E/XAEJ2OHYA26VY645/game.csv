"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. That's the lowest I can go.",13500.0,Alice,5,
