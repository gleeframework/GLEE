Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Alice has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice is in a strong position. She knows she can sell the product to John for her minimum acceptable price.  Therefore, she should aim to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible without going below her own minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,199,999. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1199999}
```

**Why This Strategy Works**

* **Creates Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties, Alice encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Just Below Valuation:** The price is slightly below Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, making it tempting.
* **Maximizes Profit (Potentially):** While Alice could start higher, this offer has the potential to secure the highest possible profit from Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate, or he might decline outright. If he declines, Alice can confidently accept John's offer."
