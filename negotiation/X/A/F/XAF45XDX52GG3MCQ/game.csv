"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115? It's a bit closer to my target price, and I'm really interested in the product.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $118? It's a bit above your target price, but I'm confident you'll love the product.",118.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the end of our negotiation rounds. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $114? It's a bit above your target price, but I'm confident it's still a fair deal.",114.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $114. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112 and $114. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $113?",113.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $116. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal. If you're willing to meet me at $116, I'm willing to make the deal.",116.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $116. I've reached my limit, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $114. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",114.0,Bob,10,
