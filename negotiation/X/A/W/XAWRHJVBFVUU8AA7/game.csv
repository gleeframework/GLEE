"Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do a bit better than that, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $112.50?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work!",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're really trying to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $112.50, so how about $118.75?",118.75,Alice,5,
