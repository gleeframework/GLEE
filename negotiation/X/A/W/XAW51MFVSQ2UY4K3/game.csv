"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $12,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return.  How about we settle at $11,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your desire for a slightly higher return, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000? I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,6,
