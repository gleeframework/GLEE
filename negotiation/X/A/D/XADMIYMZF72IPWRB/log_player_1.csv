I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a significant increase from my guaranteed minimum value of $800,000, but it leaves room for potential negotiation and allows me to maximize my profits if Bob accepts. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, there's also a potential for a higher return.
* **Potential Value to Bob:** I don't know Bob's valuation, but I believe a reasonable price increase might be appealing to him.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000, ensuring a good outcome.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and maintaining a reasonable chance of a successful sale."
