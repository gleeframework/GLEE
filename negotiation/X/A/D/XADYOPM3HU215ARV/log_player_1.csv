"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer slightly below my minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm position. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **No Mention of John:**  Revealing the backup offer from John at this stage would weaken my negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  I believe this offer reflects its fair market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value of the product. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.  While I want to negotiate, this offer is too far from a reasonable outcome to accept. It's worth seeing if I can bring Bob closer to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm proposing $975,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** I've significantly reduced my asking price from $1,100,000 to $975,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still substantially higher than Bob's offer, reinforcing that I value the product highly. 
* **Justify the Price:** I'm reiterating the product's value to counter Bob's attempt to anchor the negotiation at a low price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to establish a bargaining range closer to my target while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but your current offer is still outside my budget. I can increase my offer to $725,000.  This is a considerable increase on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my serious interest in reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving in the right direction, but $725,000 is still too low. While his offer increased, it's essential to demonstrate that I'm not going to concede easily, especially with the security of John's offer.  I'll continue negotiating to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $890,000. This offer reflects my desire to close a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:**  I've made another substantial drop in my asking price, signaling my strong interest in reaching an agreement. 
* **""Meeting Halfway"":** This language frames the offer as a fair compromise, even though it's still leaning more towards my side.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and introducing a slight sense of urgency might encourage Bob to move closer to my target.
* **Still Above John's Offer:** It's crucial to maintain a price point that justifies not accepting John's guaranteed $1,200,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is closer to what I had in mind, but still a bit high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000. I feel this is a fair compromise and reflects a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob is still significantly below my target. While he is incrementally increasing his offers,  I need to signal that the pace is too slow. The difference between our current positions remains substantial, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that far from my minimum with the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but your latest offer doesn't reflect the significant value this product brings.  I'm willing to make my final offer of $850,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's potential. "",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By explicitly stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm reaching my limit. 
* **Justifying the Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob why the price is justified, especially since he's aware it's worth more to him than his current offer.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While this is a firm offer, it's still substantially higher than Bob's best offer and allows me to walk away and accept John's offer without a significant loss.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer represents a concession from my previous offer but keeps the price well above Bob's last offer. This puts the pressure on him to make a substantial move if he wants the product."
