"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $20000. This is a fair price considering its rarity and quality. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while respecting your value for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $14000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
