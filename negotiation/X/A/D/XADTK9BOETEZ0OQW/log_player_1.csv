Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $900,000 is too low for me.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is closer to my target price. Can you consider that?

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's closer to my initial price, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 is still not in my range. I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm selling the product to John. We're running out of rounds and Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my price point.  While I would prefer to get a bit more,  $1,000,000 from John is a good outcome, and I'm not willing to risk losing that sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
