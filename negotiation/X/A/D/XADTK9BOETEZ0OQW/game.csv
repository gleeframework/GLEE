"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1050000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is closer to my target price. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950000 is still not in my range. I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $1000000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's make it happen!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

I'm not willing to go above $950000. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $975000?,975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a price in mind, but I'm not budging from $1000000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my initial offer. Let's be reasonable and close this deal at this price.  It's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

I'm not willing to go above $975000. I'm starting to think that I can find a better deal elsewhere. Can you meet me at $980000?,980000.0,Bob,8,
