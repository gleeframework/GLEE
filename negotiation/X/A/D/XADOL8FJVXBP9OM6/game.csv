"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already stretched my budget as much as I can, and I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's my final offer. I hope we can find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,6,
