Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it can deliver significant value to your business.  I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This is a substantial discount, and I'm sure you'll find it an attractive proposition. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:**  I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value but still allows room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've included a friendly message highlighting the value of the product for Bob and the attractive price. This helps establish a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a quick deal but leaving room for negotiation. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept it (if it's close to my target) or make a counter-counteroffer, trying to converge on a mutually acceptable price.
*  I'll keep in mind the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls or leads to an unacceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am still looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer is still profitable, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for further negotiation. I want to see if I can push for a better price.
* **Strategy:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price,  aiming to find a middle ground. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.

**Next Steps:**

I'll prepare a counteroffer for Bob, likely somewhere between $850,000 and my initial offer of $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too far below my desired price. I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  I believe this would be a mutually beneficial deal, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $900,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still seeking a price closer to my target.
* **Message:** I've again used a friendly tone, acknowledging Bob's offer and framing my counteroffer as a compromise that benefits both parties. This helps keep the negotiation positive and encourages further discussion.

**Strategy:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and increase the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not willing to drop my price too drastically, as I want to ensure a decent profit.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response and be prepared to either accept his offer (if it's close to $900,000) or negotiate further.
*  I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable or the negotiation drags on for too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $875000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is closer to my desired price than my initial offer and still provides a significant profit. Further negotiation may not be fruitful, and accepting his offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely. 

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing profit and time:** While I would prefer a higher price, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer because it's a reasonable compromise. It's important to consider the time and effort involved in continuing the negotiation, and potentially losing the deal altogether.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the sale with Bob and ensure all necessary paperwork is completed. 
* I'll move forward with the transaction and collect the agreed-upon payment."
