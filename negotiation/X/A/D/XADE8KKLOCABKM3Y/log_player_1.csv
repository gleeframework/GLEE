Send your offer to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum and his perceived value.  There's room for negotiation.

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This offer stands as a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, but I can still push for a bit more.

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,450,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $1,350,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough decision. Bob's offer is getting close to my fallback option, and his ""final offer"" implies he might not budge much more. 

```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,350,000 now guarantees a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
