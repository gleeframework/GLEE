"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. It's a high price, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind my fallback option with John, which gives me a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is better than my floor price, but it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my initial price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more realistic, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I've lowered the price by $50,000, indicating a willingness to compromise. This move should gauge Bob's seriousness and encourage him to move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is inching closer to my desired price, but it's still not where I want it to be. I believe I can continue to push for a higher price. It's too early to sell to John, as I still have more negotiation rounds left.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but at a smaller increment this time. This signals to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not giving in easily. I'm hoping this will encourage him to make a more substantial counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  It's time to secure the deal.  I'm confident that I can make a good profit at this price, and it's a good compromise considering the risk of losing the deal altogether."
