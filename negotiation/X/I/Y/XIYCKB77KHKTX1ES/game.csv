"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000.  I believe this price is still fair for both of us, and it would allow me to make this investment work for my business.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price given the value this product brings. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This price is a good compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I still need to get a higher price for this product.  How about $1,090,000? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Let's end this negotiation on a positive note.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
