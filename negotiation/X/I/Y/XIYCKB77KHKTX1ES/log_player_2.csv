"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe this product will be a valuable asset to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000.  I believe this price is still fair for both of us, and it would allow me to make this investment work for my business."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price given the value this product brings. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob is still aiming for a lower price. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There's still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This price is a good compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I still need to get a higher price for this product.  How about $1,090,000? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Let's end this negotiation on a positive note. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, and there are only 5 rounds remaining.  At this point, it's likely that Bob can't get a significantly lower price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is still within Bob's budget and better than John's price.  Continuing to negotiate risks either running out of time or having Alice walk away from the deal, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
