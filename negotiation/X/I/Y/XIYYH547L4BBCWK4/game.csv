"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
