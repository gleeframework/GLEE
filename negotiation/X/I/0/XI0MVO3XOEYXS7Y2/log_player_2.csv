"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start the negotiation. Alice's first offer is way above my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice, but $90 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $70? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm moving closer to my limit, but I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $70 is still below my desired value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $85. This is a good price for both of us, considering the product's quality.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is tempting, but I'm so close to my backup price with John. One more counteroffer should do it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I can do $75, and I think that's a very fair offer. It's a great product, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

I'm putting a little pressure on with the ""buy it right now"" line, hoping to sway Alice in these final rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm very close to accepting your offer, but $75 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to go up to $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would help me get closer to my desired value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice finally agreed to my price limit! No need to go to John, I'm getting the product at the price I wanted."
