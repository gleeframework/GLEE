Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his counteroffers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly higher than $1,425,000. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a better outcome at this point, avoids further negotiation, and secures a known outcome."
