"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $2,000,000 represents the high-end of its value, I can't sell it for as low as $1,200,000. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little.  $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $1,350,000?  That would be a fair deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we are getting closer.  I could be persuaded to go down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant discount and I'm confident this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I could make this work for $1,425,000.  If you're able to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
