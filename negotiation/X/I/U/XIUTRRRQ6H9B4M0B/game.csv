"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a great deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
