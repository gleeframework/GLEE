"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000.  This price is a significant discount from its true value, but I'm confident it's a fair offer.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a specific budget.  While $1,200,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price still allows for a good deal for both of us, and I believe this product will continue to be a valuable asset for your company. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, which would be $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm ready to make one final compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,350,000.  This offer reflects a significant discount for you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a fair and final price. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
