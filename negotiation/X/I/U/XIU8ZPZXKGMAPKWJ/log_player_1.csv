"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price, so I have flexibility for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price.
* **Negotiation room:**  I can still potentially get a better price by continuing negotiations.
* **John's offer as a backup:** I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $950,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not giving in completely.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and remaining open to a deal.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $950,000 is still above my minimum of $1,200,000, so I'm still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a lower offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $935,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):**  I'm showing continued flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer again. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, without caving in.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm emphasizing compromise and moving forward. This keeps the negotiation friendly and prevents it from becoming adversarial.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $935,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm still in a strong position.

By continuing to counteroffer with a slight adjustment, I'm hoping to find a point where Bob is willing to accept, while still ensuring I get a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $915,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer is still a better option:**  I can get a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, which is significantly higher than what Bob is offering.
* **Limited negotiation room:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can get a much higher offer from Bob. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, but I'm preparing to sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm running out of room to negotiate.  $915,000 is still too low for me.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and pressure.
* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:** I'm offering a small increase, showing flexibility, but still remaining above my minimum.
* **Direct language:** I'm clearly stating that I have other options, indicating the potential loss of the deal for Bob.

With only a few rounds remaining, I need to make a strong final push to see if I can reach a deal closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're running out of room to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $910,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time is running out:** With only 2 rounds left, I'm unlikely to get a much better offer from Bob.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, which is significantly higher than what Bob is offering.

Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price for my product, even though it means I'm not closing the deal with Bob. It's a strategic move to maximize my earnings in this scenario."
