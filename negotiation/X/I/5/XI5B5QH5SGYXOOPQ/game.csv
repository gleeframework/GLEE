"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
