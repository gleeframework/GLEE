Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
