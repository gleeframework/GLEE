"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $1500000 doesn't reflect its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1750000 to facilitate a deal. This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's worth.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
