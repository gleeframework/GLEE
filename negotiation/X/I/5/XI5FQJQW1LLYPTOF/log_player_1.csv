Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. I believe it's worth more. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $1,500,000.  Since John is willing to pay that, I'll sell to him instead."
