Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a competitive offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without losing the sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 allows some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy it for $10,000 gives us a strong fallback position. We don't need to go desperately low.

This strategy aims for a high profit while acknowledging Bob might negotiate."
