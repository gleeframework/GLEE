"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for this product.  It's still a fantastic deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
