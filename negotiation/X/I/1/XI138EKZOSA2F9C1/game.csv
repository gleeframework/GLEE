"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. Could we possibly settle around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is the lowest you're willing to go, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",9500.0,Alice,5,
