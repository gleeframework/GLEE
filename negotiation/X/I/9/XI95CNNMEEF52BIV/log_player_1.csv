{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth while leaving room for you to benefit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

This offer aims to maximize profit while still being appealing to Bob:

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($12,000) sets a high anchor.
* **Negotiation Margin:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as Backup:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net, allowing Alice to aim higher with Bob."
