"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I believe $800,000 is a bit low given the product's value. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking for a slightly lower price. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product for $925,000. This is the best I can do, considering the value it holds for me.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $912,500. It's a fair compromise that keeps the deal moving forward.",912500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.
