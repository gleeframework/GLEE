{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is a significant profit for me and still potentially attractive to Bob. 
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, while still giving me a comfortable profit margin.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While I'm not willing to accept $900,000, I can still negotiate with Bob. There's room for a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is ready to pay $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to hold firm and potentially get a better price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, trying to get him to see the benefit of a slightly higher price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting we find a middle ground to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is a bit higher than before, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better offer:**  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still a chance he might come up with a more favorable price.
* **John is a backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I can afford to be patient and potentially get a better price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $950,000 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I think we can close this deal if you're serious about buying it."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and his latest offer ($950,000).
* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or walk away.
* **Value reminder:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $975,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited negotiating room:**  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.  
* **John is the best option:**  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price, selling to John is the most financially beneficial decision at this point."
