Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product and understand your perspective. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose an alternative: $950,000. This amount still allows me to acquire the product without straining my finances, while also being closer to what I am willing to pay. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
