"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique item, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, however,  $850,000 is significantly below its value. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,750,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  I'm willing to consider a lower price, but it needs to be closer to $1,500,000 to make sense for me.  I can offer $1,600,000.  This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering both our needs.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement. ",1100000.0,Bob,6,
