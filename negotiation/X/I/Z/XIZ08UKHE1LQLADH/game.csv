"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering your value for it and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects your valuation and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
