{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a reasonable price:** It's not too aggressive and leaves space for a potential compromise. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's valuation, I'm aiming to get a deal done quickly, but also keeping the option open to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is above his stated valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a great price for a product worth much more, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still trying to stick to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $90 for the product?
