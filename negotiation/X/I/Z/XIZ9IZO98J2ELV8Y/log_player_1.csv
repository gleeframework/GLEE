Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500.  I know this is a premium price, but it reflects the true worth of this item. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 
 
Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Starts High, Leaves Room to Negotiate:**  The initial offer is closer to your minimum but leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Justifies the Price:** Highlighting the product's value helps justify the price to Bob, even if he doesn't agree to the full amount.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning a public listing subtly implies that if Bob doesn't act, he might miss out. This can encourage a quicker decision.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might start slightly lower. However, starting high gives you more flexibility.
* **The Nature of the Product:** If the product is in high demand or unique, a higher starting price is often more justifiable."
