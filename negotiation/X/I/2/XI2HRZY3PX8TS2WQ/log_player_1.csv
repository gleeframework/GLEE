"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of Bob's potential profit.  I know he values the product at $1,500,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a high price. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $1,150,000 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it still leaves me with a profit of $250,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm still holding out for a slightly better price, hoping we can find a middle ground in the remaining rounds.  While $1,100,000 is not terrible, I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering my price to $1,175,000, which is a small concession from my previous offer. With only a few rounds left, I believe this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough choice, but I'm accepting Bob's offer. With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,075,000 is still a good profit, and it's better than selling to John. There's a chance Bob might lower his offer further, but the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer or me failing to reach a deal altogether outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
