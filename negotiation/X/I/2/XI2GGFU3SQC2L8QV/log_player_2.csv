# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I can do $16,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $15,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from $17,000. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $15,500. I can do $16,000, and that's my final offer. If you're interested, we can shake on it. If not, I'm happy to move on to other opportunities.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has drawn a line in the sand and is unlikely to go lower than $16,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her ""final offer"".  You have a guaranteed option with John at $15,000, saving you $1,000."
