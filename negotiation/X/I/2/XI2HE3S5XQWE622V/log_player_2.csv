"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $8000 to us and we believe it's equally valuable to you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I'd like to propose an initial price of $7500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and would like to accommodate you while still valuing our product appropriately. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $7200. This allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while staying competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price to $7,200, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal for him. While further negotiation is possible, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price and avoids risking a further price increase or a stalemate."
