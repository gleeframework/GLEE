"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price from him.  While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still above my minimum threshold and leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $115. While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold, and it's getting close to the price John is willing to pay.  There's always the chance Bob might counter again, but I'm willing to take the $115 and avoid the risk of losing him entirely."
