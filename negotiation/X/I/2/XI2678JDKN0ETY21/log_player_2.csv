"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value it holds for you. Let's work together to make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's less than what Bob values the product at, it's still a significant premium compared to Alice's own valuation. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** Bob has a clear goal of saving money and there are 10 rounds to negotiate. It's likely Bob can secure a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Bob has a fallback option if negotiations fail, ensuring he won't be left empty-handed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly close the gap between his desired price and Alice's initial offer.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** Bob positions his counteroffer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $1,300,000 is a midpoint between Alice's offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's ideal price of $1,200,000. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Bob emphasizes the product's value to him, subtly suggesting that he's prepared to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1300000 is still a little below what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Small Gap:** The remaining difference is only $50,000, making the deal quite attractive.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 7 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance that Alice might become less flexible in future rounds.
* **Better Than John:** Even at $1,350,000, Bob is still saving $150,000 compared to buying from John. 

By accepting the offer, Bob secures a good deal and avoids potential delays or the risk of a higher price from John."
