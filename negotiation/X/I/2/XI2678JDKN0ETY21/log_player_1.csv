Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer just yet. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
