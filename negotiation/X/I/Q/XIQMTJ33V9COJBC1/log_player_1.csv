Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **My Minimum:** I need to get at least $10,000 (John's offer).
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving some room for negotiation but still within Bob's perceived value.

This offer gives me a good chance of getting a higher price than John's offer while still being attractive to Bob."
