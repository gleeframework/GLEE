{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $10,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $9,500 leaves room for potential negotiation while still staying significantly above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Enticing Offer:** This price point offers Bob a substantial discount compared to my backup offer, making it more likely for him to accept."
