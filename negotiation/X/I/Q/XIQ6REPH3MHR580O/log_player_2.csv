"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $120, which is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to accept $100 for it?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to your desired price. 
* $110 is a good compromise and still saves you $40 compared to buying from John.
* Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away or you wasting time increases.  It's likely you won't get a better deal."
