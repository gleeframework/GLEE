Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm aiming to stay closer to my budget of $1,000,000. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,050,000. This price still provides you with a profit, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
