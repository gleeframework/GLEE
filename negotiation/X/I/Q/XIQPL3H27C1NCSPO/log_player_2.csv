"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you can potentially save money by negotiating further.  There's room for a lower price since Alice values the product at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm aiming to stay closer to my budget of $1,000,000. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,050,000. This price still provides you with a profit, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for a decent profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $1,100,000 offer to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and accepting the offer means you save $25,000 compared to buying from John.  While you might be able to negotiate further, it's likely that the price won't drop much lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
