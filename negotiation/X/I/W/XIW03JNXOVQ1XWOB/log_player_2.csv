"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than $15,000, there is room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable value of $12,000. A counteroffer of $12,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This price allows for a potential compromise and might be attractive enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $14,000 is a better deal than buying from John, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There is potential to negotiate further, and rejecting this offer will allow for another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's already rejected a price of $14,000 and knows he can get it for $15,000 from John.  A counteroffer of $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, potentially appealing to Alice while still saving Bob money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Although $14,500 is a better deal than buying from John, it's still not the ideal price.  There's a good chance Alice will lower her price further to close the deal. Rejecting this offer allows for another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. He knows he can get the product for $15,000 from John, and Alice has already offered $14,500.  A counteroffer of $13,500 shows Bob's willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.  This is a strategic move, as Alice might be more likely to accept a counteroffer closer to her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached a critical point in the negotiation. Alice's offer of $15,000 is the same as John's price. Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to a longer process without guaranteeing a better price. Given the limited rounds and the potential for Alice to further increase her price, it's now more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John at a known and fixed price.  Bob wants to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely or ending up paying more than he is willing to."
