Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a special price of $18,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you consider coming down to $11,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.
