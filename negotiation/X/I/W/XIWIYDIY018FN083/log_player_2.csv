(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate.  It's a starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down further."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price,  $1,380,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worthwhile to continue negotiating to try and secure a lower price. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing negotiations or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 1,300,000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. There are still rounds remaining, and Bob can continue to negotiate for a lower price.  He may be able to secure a better deal in the next round, or he could choose to buy from John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,320,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is just below Alice's latest offer, showing that he's serious about closing the deal. This counteroffer is a small step towards a compromise and potentially makes Alice more likely to accept. It's also still within Bob's budget and could potentially save him some money compared to buying from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds left, the negotiation has reached a point where there's a high likelihood of Alice not accepting Bob's counteroffers, and the price is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees Bob the product within his budget and avoids further risk of losing the opportunity or spending more."
