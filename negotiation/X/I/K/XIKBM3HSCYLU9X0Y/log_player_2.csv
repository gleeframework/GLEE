"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're trying to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer is your maximum price.
* There's no information about the value of the product to Alice, so there's a possibility she'd accept a lower price.
*  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's offer. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away. 
* $12,000 is still a good price for me, as I'm willing to pay up to $15,000.
* This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from $15,000 to $13,500, which is a good discount.
* I'm still comfortable paying this price, as it's within my budget.
* There's a risk of further negotiation, but it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and I risk losing the deal to John."
