"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to me. Considering its value, I believe it would be fair to offer it to you for $120. This price reflects its high quality and the benefits it provides. I hope you find this offer attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
