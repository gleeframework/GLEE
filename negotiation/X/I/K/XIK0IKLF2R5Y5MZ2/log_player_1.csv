Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $120, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Counter:** A price of $145 might entice Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above your minimum.
* **Strategic Wording:**  Phrases like ""a steal"" and ""great deal"" aim to influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob outright rejects $145. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150, this offer maximizes your potential profit while still leaving a small chance for Bob to accept."
