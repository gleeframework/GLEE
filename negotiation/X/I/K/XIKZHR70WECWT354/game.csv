"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $120 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $80? That's the maximum I'm able to spend right now.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible! I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $100 is still a little above what I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to accept $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $95. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",95.0,Alice,5,
