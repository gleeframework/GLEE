"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this item for $95. I believe it's a great deal, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's better than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to you ($100). 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your desired price.** While it's still above what you're willing to pay, it's only $5 more than your counteroffer and  $10 less than John's price.
* **Negotiating further may not be worth the time and effort.**  You're within a reasonable range, and continued negotiation could risk losing the deal or causing Alice to walk away."
