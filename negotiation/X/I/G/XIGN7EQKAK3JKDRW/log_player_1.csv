Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. To make this a swift transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product's value to Bob, starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob  justifies the high asking price. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""swift transaction"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the high price.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a secure offer from John at my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
