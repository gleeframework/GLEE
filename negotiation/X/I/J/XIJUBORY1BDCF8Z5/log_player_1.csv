"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* This gives Bob room to negotiate, but still positions me in a strong starting position. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* While I'm aiming to secure the best possible price, I'm not desperate for a sale. 
* I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, which is a guaranteed higher profit. 
* I'm going to counteroffer to try and get a price closer to my minimum before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it shows that I'm open to negotiation.
* The message is friendly and highlights the mutual benefits of the proposed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. 
* I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John for $1,200,000 remains a more profitable option. 
* I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a price that is closer to my desired amount, before I potentially sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $1,080,000? This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a counteroffer that is slightly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, showing continued willingness to compromise.
* This price is still within my minimum acceptable price range, and it's getting closer to what I want.
* The message is positive and emphasizes a desire to finalize the deal, putting pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,065,000. This is a fair price that respects both our needs.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We've reached a point where Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* Despite my willingness to compromise, there doesn't seem to be much room for further negotiation. 
* It's becoming clear that we may not reach a mutually agreeable price. 
*  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a sure thing and guarantees me a much higher profit than I'm likely to get from Bob. 
* I'm choosing to secure this guaranteed profit and end the negotiation with Bob."
