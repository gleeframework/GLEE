"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $100? That's my absolute maximum.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $125, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  If that works for you, I'm ready to buy.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still a bit far from $110, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $115, which is the absolute lowest I can go. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
