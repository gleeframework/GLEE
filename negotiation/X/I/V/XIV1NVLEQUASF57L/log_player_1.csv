"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to create a positive and friendly tone to encourage him to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than his initial $80, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but also want to get as close to my target as possible. I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $92 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $92 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $92 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference again. How about $93.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 93.5}
```

I'm offering $93.50, which is again a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's.  I'm staying persistent in trying to get a better price while still being reasonable. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the quality of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $91 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $120.  It's important to note that with only 4 rounds left, I need to be more strategic and potentially start considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. I'm willing to go down to $92, but that's my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to go any lower. Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

I'm offering $92, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. With only three rounds left, I need to be more decisive and avoid further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $89, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that I'll be able to get a price close to my minimum. Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher, and further concessions will likely push the price below my target.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's the best option available at this point."
