"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,500,000 for the product.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both agree on.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. It's a bit closer to my initial offer, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
