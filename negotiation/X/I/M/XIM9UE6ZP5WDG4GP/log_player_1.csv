"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to my minimum of $120, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I believe I can push for a better offer, potentially even getting closer to $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about $110?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for such a great product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I have a few more rounds to negotiate, and I'm hoping I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $110. Let's split the difference and go with $109. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $109, which would be $107.50. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John for $120 ensures I get my minimum, and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower price or no sale at all."
