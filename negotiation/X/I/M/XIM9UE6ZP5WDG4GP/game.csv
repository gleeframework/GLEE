"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about $110?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for such a great product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $110. Let's split the difference and go with $109. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $109, which would be $107.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",107.5,Bob,6,
