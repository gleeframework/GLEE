"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $9,500?  I think this price reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. However, it's not an unreasonable starting point considering Alice values the product at $10,000.
* **Focus on Value:** Bob's message reiterates the shared value of the product, subtly reminding Alice that a deal is still beneficial for her. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiations, allowing for a potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I have to consider my own costs and profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice has come down to $10,500, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer and is closer to Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice explicitly states she's meeting Bob halfway. This implies a willingness to compromise.
* **Value Still Exists:** While not the ideal price, $10,500 is still well within Bob's budget and provides a considerable savings compared to John's price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price within his budget, and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or a failed deal."
