,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let's get this deal done.",95.0,Bob,4,
