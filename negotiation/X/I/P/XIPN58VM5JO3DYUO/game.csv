"I understand that $7,500 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $6,500?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $6,500 is a bit more reasonable, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $6,800. It's a slight compromise, but I think it's worth it for both of us.",6800.0,Alice,5,
