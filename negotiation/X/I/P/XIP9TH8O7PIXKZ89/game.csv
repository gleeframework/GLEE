"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to  $6,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Could you do $11,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $11,000 is better, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  $7,500 is still a significant gap from what I had in mind. How about we settle at $9,500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both of our positions.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
