"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product and its potential benefits. While I'm interested, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to start. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, while also allowing for a healthy profit margin for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
