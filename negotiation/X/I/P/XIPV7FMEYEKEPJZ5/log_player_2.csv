"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and will greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product and its potential benefits. While I'm interested, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to start. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, while also allowing for a healthy profit margin for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. After re-evaluating the market and considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value while also acknowledging your desire for a healthy profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially going back up to $800,000 or higher is a real possibility.  Additionally, buying from John would cost him $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer at $750,000 is the most financially advantageous choice at this point."
