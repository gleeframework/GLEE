Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $110 leaves room for profit while still being attractive to Bob.  He saves $10 compared to his maximum valuation, making it a good deal for him.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, it's always best to secure the highest price possible."
