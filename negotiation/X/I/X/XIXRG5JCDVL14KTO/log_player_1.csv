Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,150,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, our goal is to maximize profit. Selling to Bob above his valuation ($1,000,000) would be ideal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. It's significantly below our minimum and offers him a potential gain of $150,000 ($1,150,000 - $1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While our initial offer is firm, the message leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

It's a balance between pushing for the best price from Bob while acknowledging the safety net of our deal with John."
