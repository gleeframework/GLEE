Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get at least my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but hopefully, this initial offer will pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to earn more, accepting this offer guarantees I reach my financial goal. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
