"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its exceptional quality and features. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique product like this, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay a premium for it. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $1250000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1300000? It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but it's still a good deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1300000. How about we try $1250000 again? It's a fair compromise that still shows I'm willing to pay a premium for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
