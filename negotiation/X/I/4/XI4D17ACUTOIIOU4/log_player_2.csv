"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more than you need to pay. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $200,000."
