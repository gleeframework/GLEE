Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is considerably below its true worth and potential.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but  $875,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While closer, Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further but not below my baseline. I'll send a counter in round 5."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While your offer is closer to what I had in mind, I need to be realistic about the product's value. Let's settle at $840,000. This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I understand you need to value the product fairly, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $810,000. This is a significant move on my end, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000

While I could push for more, Bob's offer of $810,000 is above my minimum threshold and a reasonable price. Accepting ensures I make a good profit and avoids the risk of negotiations falling apart."
