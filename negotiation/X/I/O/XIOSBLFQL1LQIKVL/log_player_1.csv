I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($12,000). This is a strategic move to maximize my potential profit. I'm assuming that Bob might be willing to pay a premium if the product is valuable to him.  If he rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm countering with $16,000. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this will entice him to accept while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $13,500 is still a good deal.  It's above my minimum and close enough to my target that I'm willing to accept it. Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal."
