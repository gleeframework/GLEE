"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000).
* There's potential to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer is the logical first step."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value the product brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This price reflects the product's value and my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob believes the product is worth. 
* There is still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can make another counteroffer and potentially achieve a price closer to $850,000.
* Buying from John at $1,200,000 is significantly more expensive than the current offer from Alice."
