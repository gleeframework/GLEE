"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good deal compared to the product's worth to Alice, Bob can still get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his $8,000 target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best possible price. While $9,000 is better than the initial offer, it's still higher than his ideal price.  He's willing to risk another round of negotiation, hoping to further decrease the price."
