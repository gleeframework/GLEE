Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm saving you a significant amount compared to your valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.
