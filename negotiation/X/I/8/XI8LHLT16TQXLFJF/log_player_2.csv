"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better deal than John's $12,000, there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Reasonable offer:** $13,000 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her minimum price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer, while still showing Bob's serious interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your business, I'm hoping for something closer to my asking price. How about $13500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $13,500 is a good compromise. It's still a better deal for Bob than buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Alice will stand firm and Bob will end up paying John's higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and minimizes the risk of a worse outcome."
