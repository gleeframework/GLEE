Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below John's price ($1,190,000) leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your initial offer without trying to lowball you too much.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings from Bob while also acknowledging that you have a strong alternative if he declines."
