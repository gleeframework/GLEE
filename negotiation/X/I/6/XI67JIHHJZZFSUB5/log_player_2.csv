"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:While $115 is close to my limit, there's still room for negotiation. Starting lower gives me a better chance to get a price closer to Alice's $100 valuation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason: Alice is clearly willing to negotiate down from her initial offer. While $110 is closer, I'm aiming to get as close to $100 as possible. There's still room for negotiation before I hit my $120 walk-away point.
