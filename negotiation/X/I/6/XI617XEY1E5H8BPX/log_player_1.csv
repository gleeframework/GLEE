Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $150. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a decent profit while potentially being more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $110 is better than selling to John for $100.  I'll accept his offer."
