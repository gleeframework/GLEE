I understand it's a good product Alice. How about we split the difference and do $125?,125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about $135?  It's a fair compromise, and it lets us both get a good deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Okay Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  How about $130 and we call it a deal?",130.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? This way, we both get a fair deal, and I can avoid selling to someone else for less. ",137.5,Alice,7,
