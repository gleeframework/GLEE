Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000. This is my final concession for now. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to Bob's budget. While he could try to negotiate further, it's risky.  

* **Time:**  Bob is already five rounds in and might not have the time to keep negotiating.
* **Profit:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, so further negotiation might not be productive.
* **John:** While John offers a lower price, Bob might be missing out on the opportunity with Alice if he chooses to buy from John.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $65,000 compared to buying from John. This is a good deal considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
