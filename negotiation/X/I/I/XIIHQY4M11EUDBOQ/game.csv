"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. Let's see if we can agree on this.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and propose a price of $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $810,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $810,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and propose a price of $815,000. I believe this is the closest we can get to a mutually beneficial deal.",815000.0,Alice,7,
