,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95? I'm really interested in this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down again and offer it to you for $100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $90? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy today.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $97.50. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",97.5,Alice,7,
