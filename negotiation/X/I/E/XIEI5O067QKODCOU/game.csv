"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"I understand that $82.50 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $81.50. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",81.5,Alice,5,
