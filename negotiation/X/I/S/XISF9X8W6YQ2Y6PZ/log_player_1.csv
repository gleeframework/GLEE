While it's lower than desired, accepting $925,000 makes the most sense strategically:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's substantially more than John's offer ($800,000) and still a good profit margin.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further haggling might irritate Bob, risking the deal altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Closing now avoids delays, getting you the money sooner to reinvest."
