"I'd like to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's $600,000 less than what the product is worth to you. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who is willing to make a significant offer.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  It's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $1,175,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
