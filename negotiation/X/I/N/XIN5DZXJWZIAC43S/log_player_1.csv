"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it would bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.  $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now.  $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, but I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This product is truly unique and offers significant value to your business.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,150,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep negotiating with Bob, his offer is getting dangerously close to my absolute minimum.  To guarantee I make at least a small profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  It's a sure thing, and I can always try to get a better price on another deal."
