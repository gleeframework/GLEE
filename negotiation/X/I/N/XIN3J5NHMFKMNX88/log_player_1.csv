I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
