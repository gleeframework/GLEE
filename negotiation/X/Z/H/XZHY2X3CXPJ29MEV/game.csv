"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm confident it will greatly benefit you.  I'm asking for $2,200,000 to start negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its potential value to me.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering your own valuation.  Let's discuss.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,800,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not able to meet your price of $1,800,000.  However, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still a significant gap from my valuation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and offers a mutually beneficial outcome.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to make a profit.  Let's find a way to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
