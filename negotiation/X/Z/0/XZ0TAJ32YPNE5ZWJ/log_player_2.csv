"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $900,000 is too high, and we can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to see how Alice responds.  This is a significant discount from her original price and also leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is close to my limit, I'm still hoping to get it for closer to John's price. I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

This is my final offer. It's my maximum limit and John is offering the same price.  I'm hoping Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I'd prefer John's price,  $820,000 is still within my budget and a good deal.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal, especially with John as a backup option."
