"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down while still making a profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and significantly lower than my initial offer of $100. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob is interested in the product, his low offer indicates there's still room for negotiation. I can try to bridge the gap with a counteroffer in the next round.
* **John's Offer:**  While selling to John for $120 is tempting, I'm still in the early stages of negotiation with Bob.  There's a chance I can reach a higher price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $100 to $90, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns, demonstrating that I'm taking his perspective into account. 
* **Mutual Benefit:** I frame the offer as beneficial for both of us, emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect. 
* **Open Door for Negotiation:** I invite Bob to ""find a middle ground,"" indicating that I'm open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Progress:** Although Bob hasn't reached my target price yet, his offer is getting closer, and he's showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for Compromise:** There's still room for a counteroffer that could bridge the gap and lead to a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $120 is tempting, I believe I can still get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($90) and Bob's latest offer ($75). This shows I'm serious about finding a compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect and expressing confidence in the product's value. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.
* **Progress Towards Goal:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it gets me closer to my goal.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in finding a resolution now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I like the spirit of compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $80 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer means I'll make a small profit, which is better than nothing.
* **Finalization:** Bob has stated his maximum price, and any further negotiation might result in him walking away from the deal entirely.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 6, and each round brings us closer to the time limit where I might need to sell to John. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely."
