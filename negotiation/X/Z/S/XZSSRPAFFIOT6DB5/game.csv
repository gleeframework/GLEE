,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let me know what you think.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",80.0,Bob,6,
