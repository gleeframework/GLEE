Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.** It's significantly lower than your minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It emphasizes the value of the deal for Bob, which can make him more likely to accept. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation.  If he rejects, you can use the information from his counteroffer to adjust your strategy, always keeping in mind the $15,000 offer from John as your safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  It's too risky to accept this offer because I might be able to get a better price by negotiating further. 

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price point.  This will allow me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable deal. However, I need to be mindful that if I push too hard, I risk losing Bob entirely. The $15,000 offer from John is a safety net I can always fall back on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal. "", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategy:** By meeting Bob halfway, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price. If Bob rejects this offer, I can consider adjusting my offer again or moving on to John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to consider $10,500 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Considering the potential for further negotiation to be protracted and uncertain, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision. 

**Strategy:**

This decision balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of further negotiation and the potential for losing the sale altogether. It's important to acknowledge that negotiation is a balancing act, and sometimes a ""good enough"" deal is better than risking a lost sale or a protracted negotiation process."
