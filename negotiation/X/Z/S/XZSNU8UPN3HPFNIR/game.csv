I have a great opportunity for you! This product is a rare find and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. I'm thinking of starting at $120.,120.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate your offer, $120 is above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but would need to see it closer to $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we aim for $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go to $105?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product! I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $107.50, but I'm not going any lower than that.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm very close to your offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $106.25? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal.,106.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.",108.0,Alice,7,
