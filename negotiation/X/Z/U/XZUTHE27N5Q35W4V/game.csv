"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is significantly below its worth.  Would you consider $1,350,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be open to $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us.  While $950,000 is closer, I can't go that low. How about we meet halfway at $1,175,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the price I can get the product for elsewhere.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
