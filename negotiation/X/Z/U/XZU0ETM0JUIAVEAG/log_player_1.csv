Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product holds equal value for both Alice and Bob ($1,200,000), and Alice has a guaranteed buyer, she can aim higher. Starting at $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates down.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  Highlighting that Bob has a limited-time opportunity to purchase before others can create a sense of urgency and value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open to discussion, suggesting that Alice is willing to hear Bob's perspective and potentially negotiate the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the process."
