"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's higher than his maximum budget, and he can likely negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,150,000 is a bit below what I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1,200,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget. Since he can get the product from John for the same price, it makes sense to accept and finalize the deal."
