"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $8,000, and John is selling it for that price, rejecting Alice's offer means you can get the product for the same price."
