"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's enough space between my offer and Bob's perceived value for negotiation to happen. 

**Strategy:** 
I want to secure the best possible price while also keeping the negotiation open.  By starting with a higher price, I can gauge Bob's interest and see how much we can potentially compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there is still room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a higher price.
* **Value of Continued Negotiation:** I still have 8 rounds left, which gives me time to explore better options and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving space for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product, implying that $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiations, inviting Bob to engage further.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly lower price, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price closer to my desired range. This keeps the conversation going and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10750?  This would give us both a fair outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $15,000, though it's getting closer. 
* **Time to Negotiate More:**  I have several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my desired outcome. 
* **Room for Compromise:** While Bob's offer is closer, there is still room to negotiate upwards. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer, but one that is still closer to my minimum. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and express a willingness to reach a fair agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution. While $10,750 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,125?  This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 11125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my previous counteroffer and Bob's offer.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price would be ""fair"" to both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the conversation moving forward.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hoping we can reach a price closer to $10000.  I'm willing to go up to $10900, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $15,000, even though it's getting closer.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only four rounds remaining, the pressure is on. While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I don't want to rush into a decision I might regret.
* **Potential for Compromise:** There's still some room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has stated this is his ""final offer.""

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll emphasize the value of the product and try to understand if there's anything else that might be preventing Bob from agreeing to a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $10,900. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,900 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference one last time and settle on $11,400?  This would allow us both to walk away with a fair outcome.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again offering a middle ground, showing my willingness to negotiate while remaining above my minimum.
* **Finality:** I'm hinting at this being my final offer by suggesting ""one last time."" This adds a sense of urgency.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that $11,400 is still a good deal for him, considering the product's value.

**Strategy:**

This is my last chance to secure a price closer to my minimum. I'm using a combination of compromise, urgency, and value proposition to try and convince Bob to accept my offer."
