"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11500. This still reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10750?  This would give us both a fair outcome.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution. While $10750 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $11500. How about we meet in the middle at $11125?  This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's keep the conversation going.",11125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still hoping we can reach a price closer to $10000.  I'm willing to go up to $10900, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $10900. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10900 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference one last time and settle on $11400?  This would allow us both to walk away with a fair outcome.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11400.0,Alice,7,
