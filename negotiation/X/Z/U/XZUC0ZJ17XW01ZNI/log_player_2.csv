{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11500. This still reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room to negotiate further.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  This would give us both a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution. While $10750 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $11500. How about we meet in the middle at $11125?  This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's keep the conversation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  Bob is willing to risk the negotiation to see if he can get a lower price.  He's still confident that he can get a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can reach a price closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $10900. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10900 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference one last time and settle on $11400?  This would allow us both to walk away with a fair outcome.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,400 is still above Bob's budget.  While there's a possibility of further negotiation, Bob is starting to run out of time and is concerned that he might not be able to secure a better price.  Given that he has only three rounds left, it's a safer bet to buy from John for $10,000 and guarantee a purchase within his budget."
