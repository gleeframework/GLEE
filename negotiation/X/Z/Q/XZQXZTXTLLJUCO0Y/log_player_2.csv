Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

**Explanation:**

Bob is now making his final push. He's offering his maximum price, making it clear that he's serious about buying the product but won't go any higher. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal entirely. If Alice rejects, Bob can still buy the product from John for the same price, so he has no incentive to offer more."
