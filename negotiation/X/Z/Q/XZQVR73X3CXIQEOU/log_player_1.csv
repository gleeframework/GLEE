Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 
  
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help me understand how badly Bob wants the product. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have gone even higher. If he negotiates, I can gauge his price sensitivity. 
* **Fallback Option:** I always have the option to sell to John for $10,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me.  It's clear we're starting far apart in our valuations, but I'm not ready to walk away yet. There's still room for negotiation before I resort to selling to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair, I can come down to $14,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility, But Holding Firm:** I'm lowering my price to show willingness to negotiate, but not drastically.  Dropping to $14,000 keeps me well above both my minimum and his initial offer, signaling I'm serious about a reasonable price. 
* **Justification:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price, hoping to shift his perception from his lowball offer.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I believe there's still a possibility of reaching a price that's beneficial for both of us. I'll re-evaluate my options based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I could go up to $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It seems unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer at this point. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk getting bogged down in further haggling with Bob."
