"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  He knows the product is only worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down to $14,000.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $13000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is a good compromise.
* **Bob's Goal:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* **Comparison:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away. $13,500 is still a decent deal for Bob, and he's saving $1,500 compared to buying from John.

**Conclusion:** It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price lower than John's."
