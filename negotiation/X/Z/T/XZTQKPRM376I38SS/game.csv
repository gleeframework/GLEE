"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $13000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,
