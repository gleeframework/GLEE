"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is far below what I can accept, I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,000? That still offers you a good deal while allowing me to recover a significant portion of the product's worth to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm getting closer to your number, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? I'm hoping we can find a win-win solution.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  I hope you'll consider this final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this. I could make a deal today at $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but $7,500 is still too low.  I'm prepared to make one final concession and meet you halfway at $8,500. This price gives you a great deal on a valuable product while ensuring I receive a fair return.  I'm hoping we can close this deal today.",8500.0,Alice,7,
