"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer like $5,000 allows for significant room for negotiation. Even if Alice rejects it outright, it gives a baseline for future offers.  It's important to keep John's $8,000 offer in mind as a potential alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is far below what I can accept, I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,000? That still offers you a good deal while allowing me to recover a significant portion of the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $9,000 is closer to a reasonable price, we're still above John's offer. Alice seems open to negotiation, so there's room to push for a better deal.  We are aiming to buy for less than $8,000, and we still have several rounds to try and achieve that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm getting closer to your number, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? I'm hoping we can find a win-win solution."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We don't want to jump too high from our previous offer of $5,000. A $1,500 increase shows willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further bargaining.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning a budget constraint gives a reason for the lower offer without directly devaluing the product.
* **Win-Win Emphasis:**  Framing the negotiation as a ""win-win"" reinforces the goal of finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  I hope you'll consider this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Even though Alice's offer now matches John's price, we've successfully negotiated her down significantly. This suggests there might be a small window for further negotiation to get the price even lower.  It's worth a shot since we still have rounds left.  We'll aim slightly below John's price to incentivize Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this. I could make a deal today at $7,500. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Decrease:** Offering $7,500 is a small but strategic decrease. It shows Alice we are serious about buying but want the best possible deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Saying ""I could make a deal today"" implies we are ready to close the deal immediately if she accepts, potentially motivating her.
* **Calculated Risk:** We are now below John's $8,000 offer. There's a risk Alice might walk away, but the potential savings justify the gamble at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but $7,500 is still too low.  I'm prepared to make one final concession and meet you halfway at $8,500. This price gives you a great deal on a valuable product while ensuring I receive a fair return.  I'm hoping we can close this deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has increased her offer after previously dropping to $8,000. This suggests she's unlikely to go any lower than $8,500.
* **John's Price:** We have a standing offer from John for $8,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is low, and risking a better offer from Alice is unlikely to yield significant savings.

It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
