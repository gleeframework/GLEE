You're willing to pay $100, and Alice is asking for $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down to $110, which is closer to your budget, but you're still aiming to save more.  It's worth trying another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $110 is closer, I'm still only able to go as high as $105.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $115. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now asking $115, which is still above your maximum budget of $100. You've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like she's not willing to budge much further. It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $100, which is within your budget."
