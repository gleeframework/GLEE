"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for your business.  I could consider coming down to $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
