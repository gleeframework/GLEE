Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows some room for Bob to negotiate (if he wants) while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly is preferable to waiting for John, even if John offers a guaranteed $8,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he might be for the product."
