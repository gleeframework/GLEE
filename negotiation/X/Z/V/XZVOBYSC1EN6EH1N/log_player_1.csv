Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $120, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $110 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value makes it more likely he'll consider the deal. 

By starting high, but not unreasonably so, I increase the chances of securing a price that's beneficial for both of us."
