"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you working with me. However, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
