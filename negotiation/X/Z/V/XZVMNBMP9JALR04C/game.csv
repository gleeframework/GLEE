"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a valuable product, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
