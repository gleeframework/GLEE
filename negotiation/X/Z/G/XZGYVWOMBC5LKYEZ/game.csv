"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $120? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right now.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, though. How about $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
