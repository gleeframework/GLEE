{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than his initial offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."

Round 3

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $108 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $109? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 109}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we go with $107? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $107 is getting closer to my minimum, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. I don't want to risk further haggling and potentially end up with a lower price.  Jhon is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum, so I'll go with him."
