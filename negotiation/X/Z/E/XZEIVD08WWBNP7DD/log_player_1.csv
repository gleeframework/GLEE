{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's something truly special, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it, but I'm open to discussion.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This initial offer is high, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high, but also signal that you're open to finding a price that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price. There is no point in further negotiation as any counteroffer may result in rejection by Bob and you will end up selling to John at the same price."
