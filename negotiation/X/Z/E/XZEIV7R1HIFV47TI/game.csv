"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can we meet in the middle?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $90 is a more reasonable price. Can we meet in the middle?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $100 is a fair price for both of us. Can you meet me at this price?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. $100 is a good starting point, but I need to make a little more on this sale. How about we settle on $145? That's just a bit more than your offer, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $145 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $145, which is $122.50. Can we agree on that price?",122.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. While $122.5 is getting closer, I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we split the difference again? $133.75 is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's seal this deal!",133.75,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $133.75 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",125.0,Bob,10,
