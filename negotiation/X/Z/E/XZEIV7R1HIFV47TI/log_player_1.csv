"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum desired price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Negotiation Room:** Leaving some room for negotiation is crucial to potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below the product's worth to Bob ($100). 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for such a low price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps my leverage and allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer (too low) to keep the negotiation respectful and show that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Moderate Price:**  $125 is still higher than Bob's offer but is significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility without sacrificing too much.
* **Focus on Benefits:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob (""good price"") to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $90 is a more reasonable price. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $90 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below the product's worth to Bob ($100).
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps my leverage and allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have more rounds left and John is willing to pay my minimum price. I can still negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by offering a price lower than my previous offer.
* **""Split the Difference"" Approach:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can make the offer feel more balanced and fair.
* **Appeal to a Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a fair solution for both of us.
* **Reiterate Interest:** I'm emphasizing my interest in selling to Bob, but only at a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $100 is a fair price for both of us. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer:** $100 is the minimum value Bob is willing to pay, and is closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I still want to push for a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:** I still have more rounds left and John is waiting to buy the product. I am not desperate.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting his offer maintains my leverage and allows me to counter with a higher price.  I will aim for a price just below what John is willing to pay."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. $100 is a good starting point, but I need to make a little more on this sale. How about we settle on $145? That's just a bit more than your offer, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Appeal to Progress:** I acknowledge we're getting closer to an agreement, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Small Increase:** I only increase the price by $45, showing a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Urgency:** I use phrases like ""let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $145 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $145, which is $122.50. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer:** $122.5 is much closer to my desired price than his previous offers, and it's significantly higher than his initial offer. 
* **Still Room for Negotiation:** I am not desperate to sell the product and still have more rounds to negotiate.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps my leverage and allows me to counter with a slightly higher price, potentially closing the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. While $122.5 is getting closer, I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we split the difference again? $133.75 is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's seal this deal!"", ""product_price"": 133.75} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's willingness to negotiate and continue to frame the offer as a fair solution.

* **Urgency:** I use phrases like ""seal this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept, as this is the penultimate round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $133.75 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation, and I have to make a decision.
* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While $125 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offers, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  John is willing to pay my desired price of $150, making his offer the most profitable option for me. 
* **No Room for Negotiation:**  Since I cannot make a counteroffer in this final round, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and secure the best possible price."
