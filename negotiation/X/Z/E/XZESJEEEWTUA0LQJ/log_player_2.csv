"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for $120 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's always best to try and negotiate.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90 at this point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Offering significantly lower than Alice's initial price sets the stage for negotiation and encourages Alice to come down.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $90 is still a decent starting point, showing you're serious about buying but also leaving room for compromise.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message indicates willingness to negotiate further, keeping the door open for a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice has come down, $110 is still higher than your desired price point. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to lower her price further. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** You might be able to secure a lower price with a strategic counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm really interested in this product and think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering to split the difference shows a willingness to find common ground.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  Mentioning that the price is fair for both sides can make Alice more receptive.
* **Staying within Budget:** $105 is still within your budget limit and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than $105. I'm willing to meet you at $115, as I mentioned earlier, but I can also consider going to $112.50. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Limit:**  While $112.5 is closer to your budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still a bit higher than your ideal price point. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** You're within striking distance of a deal that works for you.  A final counteroffer might push Alice to your desired price.
* **Not Ready to Settle:**  Rejecting the offer gives you another opportunity to negotiate and potentially save a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $112.50.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  To make this work, I'd need to come in at $107.50.  I'm really eager to get this product and believe this price reflects its value fairly."", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($105) and Alice's current offer ($112.50), demonstrating a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasize Value:**  The message reaffirms your interest in the product and suggests the offered price reflects its value.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer leaves very little room for further negotiation, aiming to secure a deal close to your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're eager to get the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $107.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $107.50 and $112.50, which would be $110. Let's call it a deal at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Alice's offer of $110 is just $10 above your initial goal of $100.  This is a very good price, especially considering the limited number of rounds remaining.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Rejecting Alice's offer could lead to further negotiation, but there's no guarantee that you'll get a better deal. Additionally, you risk running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  With only three rounds left, accepting this offer secures the product within your budget and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
