Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his maximum perceived value is $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to his maximum. 
* **Above Minimum:** It's crucial to stay above your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) to ensure a profit, even if Bob negotiates down slightly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you don't have additional information about Bob's negotiating style. If you knew he was very agreeable, you might start higher. 
* **Market Demand:** This assumes you're confident John will buy the product for $10,000. If the market is uncertain, you might be more willing to accept a lower offer from Bob."
