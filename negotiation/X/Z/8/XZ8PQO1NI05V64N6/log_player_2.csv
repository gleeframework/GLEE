"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I can do better. I'm aiming to get the product for as close to $1,000,000 as possible. I'll counteroffer and see where that takes us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given the value it holds for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects its true value, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit too far apart. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still feeling a bit high at $1,150,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get the deal done. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000 for the product. This price still reflects its true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but we're still $125,000 apart. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can finalize a deal. I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $1,000,000.  I'm also considering the possibility of buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I can spend. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your final offer of $1,075,000, but I'm still not willing to accept it. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000 for the product. This price is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is closer to my target price, but it's still $100,000 more than I want to pay. At this point, I've exhausted my negotiating options with Alice and there's a real risk of going another few rounds with no guarantee of a better deal. John is offering the product for my target price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity.  I'm going to buy from John."
