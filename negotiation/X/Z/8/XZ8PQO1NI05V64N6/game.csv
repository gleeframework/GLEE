"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given the value it holds for me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects its true value, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still feeling a bit high at $1,150,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get the deal done. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000 for the product. This price still reflects its true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I can spend. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to look at other options.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your final offer of $1,075,000, but I'm still not willing to accept it. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000 for the product. This price is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
