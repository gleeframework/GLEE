"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique and high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point ($700,000 is less than your maximum of $800,000), there's room for negotiation. You can try to lower the price further by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I have to say that $650,000 is still a bit below my target price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $675,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $675,000 is a good deal for you. It's significantly lower than your maximum budget of $800,000 and only slightly higher than your last counteroffer.  Accepting this offer saves you $125,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
