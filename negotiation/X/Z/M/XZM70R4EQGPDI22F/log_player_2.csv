"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $200. I think it's a fair price that reflects its quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's best to counter-offer and see if she's willing to negotiate down to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $140? That's a very reasonable offer for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still too high. We're getting closer to your budget, so it's worth making another counteroffer and seeing if you can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $140 is still a little high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's a significant jump on my end."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $125?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting close to your budget, but it's still worthwhile to see if you can get her to come down a little bit more. There are still a few rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the movement and I understand this is your final offer.  To be honest, $125 is just a bit beyond what I've budgeted for this.  Would you be willing to meet at $115? I'm ready to close the deal right now if so."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

We are pushing a bit closer to your limit here, but by expressing you are ready to close the deal immediately, it might incentivize Alice to accept."
