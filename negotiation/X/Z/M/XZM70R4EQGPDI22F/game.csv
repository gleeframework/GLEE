"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $200. I think it's a fair price that reflects its quality.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $140? That's a very reasonable offer for this product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $140 is still a little high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's a significant jump on my end.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $125?  That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the movement and I understand this is your final offer.  To be honest, $125 is just a bit beyond what I've budgeted for this.  Would you be willing to meet at $115? I'm ready to close the deal right now if so.",115.0,Bob,6,
