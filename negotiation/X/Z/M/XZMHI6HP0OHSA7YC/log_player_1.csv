Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still above my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and gives us both a good deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,120,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,120,000 is a substantial profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Bob and risk him walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
