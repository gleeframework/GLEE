"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,200,000 is far beyond your budget of $800,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows you to start negotiations and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. How about we consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fairer point to continue our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still significantly higher than your budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,900,000 is still way too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope you consider it."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for working with me on this. I see we're making progress.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from what I need. To be frank, I have another potential buyer, but I believe in giving you a fair chance. Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000? This feels like a compromise where we both might find agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is clearly trying to meet you halfway, $1,600,000 is still outside your budget.  You've shown you're willing to negotiate, but it's important to stick to your maximum price. Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still unable to go above $1,100,000. This is a final offer from me, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
