"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though it's above Bob's known valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting point,"" I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

The goal is to anchor the negotiation at a high point while remaining realistic enough to keep Bob at the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which isn't unexpected. It's far too early to accept this low offer, especially knowing I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. I need to bring him up significantly.  I'll use the next round to try to do that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. How about we consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fairer point to continue our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer to show I'm listening but remain firm that it's too low.
* **Significant Drop, But Not Too Much:** I'm dropping the price by $300,000 to show movement and willingness to negotiate, but keeping it well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the still-high price and encourage Bob to move closer to my range.

The goal is to signal some flexibility while still aiming high and keeping the pressure on Bob to increase his offer substantially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,900,000 is still way too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope you consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $1,000,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to continue as long as I see progress.  Accepting now would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for working with me on this. I see we're making progress.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from what I need. To be frank, I have another potential buyer, but I believe in giving you a fair chance. Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000? This feels like a compromise where we both might find agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone, Acknowledging Progress:** I'm starting with a positive tone to encourage continued negotiation and acknowledge Bob's movement.
* **Introducing Competition:** By mentioning another buyer, I create a sense of urgency and scarcity, subtly pressuring Bob to raise his offer. 
* **Strategic Compromise (with a higher minimum):** I'm lowering my asking price to $1,600,000, which is above my absolute minimum but presents it as a compromise.  This sets a new target for Bob while still leaving room for potential negotiation upwards. 

I'm hoping this combination of tactics encourages Bob to make a more substantial move in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still unable to go above $1,100,000. This is a final offer from me, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is signaling that $1,100,000 is his absolute limit with the ""final offer"" statement. Even if I continue negotiating, it's unlikely I can bridge the gap to my $1,500,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. It's not worth the risk of trying to squeeze more from Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
