,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $7,000?  I believe that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
