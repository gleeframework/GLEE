"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to do $7,500? That's about as high as I can go.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway earlier. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $8,200? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,5,
