"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we value this product at $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000.
