"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum.  
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the potential value for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* This strategy allows for negotiation while ensuring I am not immediately forced to take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This represents a significant discount for you, and it ensures I receive a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,350,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **The message:** This message is still friendly but firm, clearly stating my minimum while emphasizing the value Bob will receive with this price.
* This strategy aims to find a middle ground and continue the negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly his valuation and far below my minimum of $1,500,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, there's no indication that Bob is willing to move significantly higher. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who will pay my minimum price."
