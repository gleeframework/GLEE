"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's try $950,000. This is getting very close to my budget, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
