"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept. It's far below the product's true value. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,250,000.  This reflects the product's unique benefits and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly more, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product. My new counteroffer is $1,200,000. This is my final price, and I believe it represents a good compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
