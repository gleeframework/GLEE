"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's a good starting point,  Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  It's worth a few rounds to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. Is this more in line with what you're looking for? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price, $950,000 is still too high. Bob has the leverage, knowing John is willing to sell for $1,200,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit steep.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $825,000.  It's a fair price that leaves room for both of us to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still too high.  Bob has made significant progress in getting the price down, and there's still potential for a better deal.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if Alice will come down further.  Buying from John would be a costly alternative, so it's best to continue exploring options with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $875,000? That's a significant step closer to my last offer and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is just $25,000 above your last offer. I'm not sure how much lower I can go without losing money on this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the lowest she's been willing to go so far, it's still above Bob's desired price. With only 3 rounds left before having to buy from John, Bob needs to be strategic. He can likely still negotiate a better deal, especially since Alice has indicated a willingness to compromise. Another round of counteroffers might help them reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. Let's try $890,000.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the price I'd be willing to sell to John. I'm willing to meet you at $895,000, but I'm not sure how much lower I can go. I think this is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $895,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer and is a significantly better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. With only one round left, it's a good risk to accept this offer and secure the product at a favorable price.  While Bob might be able to squeeze out another $5,000, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John is too high."
