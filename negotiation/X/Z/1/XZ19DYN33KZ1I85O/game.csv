"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $11,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This feels like a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go up to $11,100. This is a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy and close the deal.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price.  $11,100 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of this product. How about $11,150? This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal.",11150.0,Alice,7,
