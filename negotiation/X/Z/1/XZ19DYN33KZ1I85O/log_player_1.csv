"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging message to hopefully make Bob feel good about the deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm setting myself up for negotiation by leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on how Bob responds and how many rounds remain before I need to switch to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have 8 rounds left. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, there's still potential for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer somewhere between Bob's offer and my initial offer. The goal is to inch closer to my target price while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** The price remains above Bob's perceived value, but is closer to my minimum. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm using language that emphasizes fairness and mutually beneficial outcomes.

**Next Round Strategy:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will continue to adjust my counteroffers, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price, John's offer, and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $11,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but there's still a chance to get closer to my target price with Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $12,000. I'll continue to emphasize fairness and mutual benefit in my communication with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This feels like a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price exactly in the middle of Bob's offer ($11,000) and my previous offer ($11,500). This shows a commitment to compromise and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to be reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language like ""happy"" to create a positive and collaborative negotiation atmosphere.

**Next Round Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my options. I'm running out of rounds, and the risk of losing out to John's offer increases. If Bob remains steadfast at $11,000, I might have to accept his offer in round 6 or 7 to avoid losing out on the sale entirely. However, I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go up to $11,100. This is a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy and close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  We're down to 4 rounds left.  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing out to John's offer in the next few rounds.
* **Possibility of Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still a chance to get a better offer from Bob, especially since we are nearing the end of the negotiation.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below John's offer.  My goal is to push Bob closer to my desired price without jeopardizing the deal entirely. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the mutual benefits of closing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price.  $11,100 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of this product. How about $11,150? This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 11150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only increasing the price by $50. This shows a willingness to compromise and reach an agreement quickly.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how it's worth a bit more.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  With only 3 rounds left, I want to give Bob a sense that time is running out and he needs to make a decision.

**Next Round Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to make a decision in the next round. I'll need to weigh the risk of losing to John against the possibility of getting a slightly better price from Bob. I'll likely accept Bob's offer in round 8 if he doesn't budge, but I'll still try to negotiate in round 7 and emphasize the value of the product."
