"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a better deal.
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** My goal is to save as much money as possible. Starting at $7,000 gives me a chance to potentially buy the product for significantly less than Alice's initial offer and closer to its actual value to her ($8,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm aware that this offer might be too low for Alice, but it opens the door for further discussion and counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to her value, but we still have room to negotiate and get a better price. It's still early in the rounds, so there's no need to rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we try $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer from $7,000 to $7,750, showing Alice that I'm willing to move towards her price, but I'm still seeking a significant discount.
* **Targeting Below Value:** My goal is to get the product for less than $8,000 (its value to Alice). $7,750 is a strategic move toward that target. 
* **Maintaining Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the negotiation active and leaving room for Alice to counter if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to take another step closer to your offer and propose a price of $8,200. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Value:**  While Alice is getting closer to her bottom line, $8,200 is still above the product's value to her.  
* **Time for Leverage:** We are getting closer to the halfway point in the rounds. Rejecting this offer might push Alice to be more flexible in the next round to avoid reaching a point where I might consider John's offer. 
* **Calculating Risk:** There's a risk that Alice will be firmer on her price, but I'm willing to take that chance to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a middle ground here. Would you consider $7,900? I think that's a reasonable offer considering the current market value."", ""product_price"": 7900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm making a smaller increase this time ($7,750 to $7,900), signaling that I'm serious about buying but still want a competitive price.
* **Below Value, Above Midpoint:**  This offer is strategically placed just below Alice's value ($8,000) and above the midpoint between our last offers ($8,050). 
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm applying a bit more pressure. This offer is attractive enough that Alice might accept, but still leaves me room to negotiate if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $8,100, which is just a little above your last offer. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $8,100 is very close to Alice's value ($8,000) and a significant saving compared to John's offer ($10,000). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a small potential saving ($100) is now risky. Alice might become less willing to compromise, and I could end up paying John's higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, accepting now secures the deal at a favorable price. It's better to accept a good offer than risk losing it."
