"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
