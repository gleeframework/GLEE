"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what you could get the product for from John.  It makes sense to negotiate down towards a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to go below $800,000, which is John's price. There's no point in further negotiation with Alice. You can get the product for the desired price from John."
