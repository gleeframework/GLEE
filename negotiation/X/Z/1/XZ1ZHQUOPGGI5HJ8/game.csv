"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I see the value in this product, but that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think there's some room for us to find a price that works for both of us. Would you be open to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not willing to let go of the product for $900,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
