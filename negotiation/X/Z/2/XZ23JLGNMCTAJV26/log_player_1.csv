{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While it's closer than his first offer, I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation in hopes of getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit low for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob isn't happy with it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is tempting, it still falls short of my minimum price.  I'm going to take a gamble and counter-offer one more time, hoping that Bob will finally budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, I need to make at least $110 on this sale. Would you be willing to go up to $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product, and this is the best I can offer."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm sticking to my minimum price, but I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make it clear that I'm not willing to go lower."
