Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity. I have a product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm asking for $1,800,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I emphasize that I'm open to negotiation. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to engage in the process.
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention that the product could be valuable to Bob's business. This implicitly suggests that it's worth more than the asking price. 

This strategy is risky, but it has the potential for the highest return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1000000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  Selling for $1,000,000 would be a huge loss for me.
* **John is a guaranteed buyer at a price that's closer to my minimum.**  While $1,200,000 isn't ideal, it's a much better outcome than accepting Bob's lowball offer. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm bridging the gap between my initial asking price and Bob's offer by proposing a price that's the midpoint between the two. 
* **Highlighting value again:** I reiterate the potential value of the product to Bob's business, hoping to incentivize him to consider a higher price.
* **Showcasing flexibility:** By offering a discount, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties. 

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal, but I'm willing to compromise to secure a deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for being willing to negotiate.  $1500000 is still a bit out of my range. Would you consider coming down to $1200000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.** While I would prefer to get more, accepting Bob's offer wouldn't be a terrible outcome.
* **John is a guaranteed buyer at the same price.**  However, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept any further counteroffers, and continuing to negotiate risks losing both buyers.
* **Minimizing risk and securing a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John ensures a quick and certain sale at my minimum acceptable price, minimizing risk and maximizing my financial security. 

I'm choosing to prioritize certainty and eliminate the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
