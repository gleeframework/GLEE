"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1000000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for being willing to negotiate.  $1500000 is still a bit out of my range. Would you consider coming down to $1200000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with this purchase.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
