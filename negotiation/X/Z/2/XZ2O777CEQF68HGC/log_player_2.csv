"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $800,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a great starting point, but you can likely get a better deal. Since you have a maximum budget of $1,200,000 and the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offering process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800,000. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I need to ensure it aligns with my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $750,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to try to get the price down further. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if I can reach a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $750,000, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $725,000? It's a fair price that's within my budget, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $725,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $775,000 is a tempting offer and closer to my target, I believe there's still potential for negotiation. I'm not willing to pay more than $750,000 right now, so I'll reject the offer and continue to negotiate. The fact that Alice is willing to make concessions shows that she's motivated to sell, and there's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping we can find a more agreeable price. How about $750,000?  This would allow us to finalize the deal, and I'm confident you'll still make a profitable sale. Let's see if we can close the gap."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate at this point. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $790,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would like to push for a lower price, we are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Alice has made several concessions already and it's unlikely she'll go lower. $790,000 is a good price and  it's still well within my budget and saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John.  Therefore, it's more strategic to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal or being forced to pay a higher price later."
