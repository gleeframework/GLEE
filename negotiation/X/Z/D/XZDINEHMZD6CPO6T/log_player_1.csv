I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $120.  This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. It's below my minimum value of $120. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm offering $130, which is still higher than my minimum but lower than my initial offer. I want to show some flexibility while still ensuring I get a fair price."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  We're running out of rounds, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price from Bob.  It's better to guarantee the minimum price than risk getting nothing."
