``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, meaning she's willing to sell it for at least that much. 
* You're willing to pay up to $10,000.
* Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above her minimum, but there's room for negotiation to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price."
