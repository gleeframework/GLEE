"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product has the potential to bring you even greater returns. Would you consider $1,200,000? I'm confident this would be a wise investment on your end.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  I can do $1,050,000 today to get this done. Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,050,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, $1,150,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,100,000? That's my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
