Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I've done my research and I know you could benefit greatly from it. I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $15,000, we want to maximize our profit. Offering it at his maximum valuation leaves no room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $12,000 is a significant profit margin for Alice (a $4,000 gain) while still offering Bob a substantial discount from his perceived value. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Starting higher gives room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to his $15,000 valuation.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale and maximizing profit."
