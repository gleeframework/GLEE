{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with her before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This is a significant drop from her initial offer, but it leaves room for bargaining in the subsequent rounds.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, but it's a significant improvement from her initial price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push her further down. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still firm on getting a price closer to my target.  My goal is to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us, and I believe this offer reflects that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit higher than my ideal.  I'm going to continue to push for a better deal. I still have six rounds left, and I don't want to miss out on the possibility of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. I'm hoping that this offer will be tempting enough for Alice to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my budget, but I'm still going to reject it.  I have four rounds remaining, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to get the price down to $1,400,000 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer. Since Alice has come down to $1,450,000, I'm confident that I can convince her to accept my offer of $1,400,000. This is a good compromise, and it will save me $50,000 compared to her last offer.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and this is my last chance to get a price I'm comfortable with before buying from John."
