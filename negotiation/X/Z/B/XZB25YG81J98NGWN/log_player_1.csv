Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer.  If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still higher than Bob's perceived value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting.  It's higher than his initial offer and still provides me with a decent profit. While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate or by selling to John, the risk of further negotiation and the potential time involved makes accepting Bob's offer the best choice."
