"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to him, so he starts by offering the minimum price he's willing to pay.  This gives Alice a chance to counter, but it also shows Bob's commitment to a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price, as he's still confident he can get a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to him and Alice is likely willing to sell it for less than her initial asking price. This offer is a compromise between Alice's last offer and Bob's maximum budget, showing that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair price."
