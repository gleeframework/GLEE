Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price up to $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Respectfully, Alice, I've done my best to accommodate your needs while staying within my financial constraints. Given the current market conditions and the value I place on the product, I am unable to move beyond $1,080,000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.

It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and at $1,080,000, it's a reasonable profit above my minimum. Holding out for more might backfire."
