"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $100 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start with a counteroffer that gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Expressing Interest:** The message aims to convey that you are serious about buying but need a price that fits your budget. 
* **Seeking Compromise:** By asking ""What do you think?"" you invite Alice to counter your offer and engage in a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget, but $100 is too low for me.  Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still above your $120 maximum. There's room for further negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer, Alice. How about $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($100) and Alice's counteroffer ($140). 
* **Suggesting Fairness:** Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Alice to view it favorably.
* **Remaining Below Max:** Importantly, this offer keeps you below your $120 maximum, ensuring you stick to your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $130, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling that she's unwilling to go lower than $130 with her ""final offer.""  Since this is still above your $120 maximum, it's time to walk away and buy from John, who guarantees the product at your target price."
