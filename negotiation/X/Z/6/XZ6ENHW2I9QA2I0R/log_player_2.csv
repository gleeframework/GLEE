(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $140 is too high for Bob, especially since he's already rejected a similar price in the previous round. 
* With only 3 rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price with Alice is low.
* Buying from John for $150 is a more attractive option as it guarantees a purchase within Bob's budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice.
* Although buying from John means paying the maximum, it eliminates the risk of further negotiation rounds with Alice potentially leading to a higher price."
