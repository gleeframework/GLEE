Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $9,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not outrageously so. It leaves room for negotiation without immediately alienating him.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message emphasizes that I'm open to negotiation, which encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe there's room for a counteroffer that would be more profitable for me.
* **John is a strong safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's current offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer,  $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  $8,500 is halfway between my initial offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,500. It shows willingness to negotiate while still getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to reinforce the justification for the price.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While I'm open to compromise, I'm not going to significantly lower my price without more leverage from Bob.  I'm still comfortable walking away and selling to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me at a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as high as $8,500. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the price I've already found from another seller. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough:**  While $8,000 is closer to my minimum price of $10,000, it's still significantly less than I'd like to get. 
* **John is a guaranteed higher price:** I know I can sell to John for $10,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a better price.  Selling to John ensures a higher profit and eliminates the risk of continued negotiations potentially lowering my final price."
