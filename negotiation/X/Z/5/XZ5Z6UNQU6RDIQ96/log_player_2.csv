You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and respectful** to maintain a good negotiating relationship.
* **Establish a starting point** significantly lower than Alice's asking price.
* **Leave room for further negotiation** as we work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Alice is offering the product at our maximum price. There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
