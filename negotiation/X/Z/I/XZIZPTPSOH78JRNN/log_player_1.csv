"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and signal that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I won't settle for his initial lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his initial offer.  I've already gone down from my initial price, and I'm not sure I'll get anything better from him. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I would have preferred to get more, I'm satisfied with the guaranteed $1,200,000."
