"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is your maximum price. It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price. There's no point in buying from John at this point, as Alice is offering the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be interested in buying the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Aggressive but reasonable:**  Starting with a significant discount (20%) shows you're serious about negotiating and sets the tone for a lower price. 
- **Focus on your budget:** Mentioning your budget emphasizes the price is a hard limit for you.
- **Justification:** Providing a justification for your offer (""value I see in this product"") makes it seem more calculated and less arbitrary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Alice's compromise isn't enough:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still $100,000 above your counteroffer. It's worth trying to push for a lower price. 
- **Still room to negotiate:** With 7 rounds remaining, there's time to negotiate further.  
- **Don't rush into buying:**  Buying from John right now is not necessary, as Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product and the fact that I'm ready to buy today. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain your position:** Reinforce your previous offer to show you're serious and not willing to budge much further.
* **Highlight the benefits:**  Mention the ""value we both see"" and ""ready to buy today"" to make it appealing for Alice to close the deal.
* **Emphasize finding common ground:**  This suggests a willingness to compromise while staying firm on your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Alice's compromise is significant:** Alice has come down $50,000 from her previous offer, which is a good sign. 
- **Close to your target:** $1,050,000 is only $50,000 above your desired price.
- **Time is running out:**  With 5 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price.
- **John's offer is not better:** John is selling at your maximum price, so Alice's offer is actually a better deal."
