Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while ensuring I don't lose out on a potential higher offer."
