Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing our fallback is $120 from John.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $110 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80), but it's still attractive compared to him not getting the product. 
* **Psychology:** By framing it as a ""special price,"" we add a sense of urgency and value.

**It's a gamble:** Bob might reject $110, but there's a chance he values getting the product now and at a discount more than the extra $30 he saves by declining."
