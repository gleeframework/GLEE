"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $11,250 for the product. This gives us both a fair deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,875? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $10,875 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a number that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000, and I hope you'll meet me halfway. This will allow me to close the deal while still getting a reasonable return on my product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
