"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still more than he's willing to pay, and he has room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $11,250 for the product. This gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's only $250 away from his ideal price with John, and he's already shown his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,875? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $10,875 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a number that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000, and I hope you'll meet me halfway. This will allow me to close the deal while still getting a reasonable return on my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer is only $1000 less than what he's willing to pay.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  Buying from John is a safer option, as he knows John will sell for his target price."
