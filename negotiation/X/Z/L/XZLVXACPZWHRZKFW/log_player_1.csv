Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is higher than his value for the product, but it leaves some room for negotiation and gives me a chance to potentially earn closer to my desired price. If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and consider my options, including selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still lower than I'd like. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer. I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm counteroffering Bob at $10,500. This is halfway between my desired price and his offer, and hopefully, it's a sweet spot that he'll find acceptable. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now getting too low for my liking, and I'm starting to run out of time and leverage.  It's better to sell to John for $10,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum value.  I don't want to risk getting caught in a long negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with an even lower offer."
