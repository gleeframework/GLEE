"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm confident this product would be a great addition to my collection."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $10,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm really serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product for $11,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's budget. While there are still rounds left, it's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to drop her price significantly.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sensible option at this point. There is a significant risk that further negotiation with Alice will not result in a price Bob is comfortable with, potentially leading to a lost deal."
