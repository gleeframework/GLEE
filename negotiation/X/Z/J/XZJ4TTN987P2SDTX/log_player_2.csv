"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,100,000. Alice values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.  It also shows Alice that you are serious about negotiating a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You're still better off trying to negotiate further.  There's likely room for Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is slightly higher than your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise. It still leaves room for Alice to make a small concession, and it's a better price than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still too high. You're only $25,000 away from John's price, and there's still room for Alice to come down.  Rejecting this offer allows you to try for one more counteroffer before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your final counteroffer. You're now only $75,000 away from John's price, and it's a good chance for Alice to close the deal. If she rejects this offer, you'll move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer matches John's price.  Since you have no further leverage to negotiate a lower price with Alice, it's more efficient to purchase the product from John for the same price. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation with Alice at this point."
