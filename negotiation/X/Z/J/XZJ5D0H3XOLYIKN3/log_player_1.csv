Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value, but not giving it away entirely.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $9500.  Let's see if this is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer is now getting close to my minimum. I'm not willing to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to reject his offers.  $8,500 is a reasonable outcome, considering my minimum and the possibility of having to sell to John for less."
