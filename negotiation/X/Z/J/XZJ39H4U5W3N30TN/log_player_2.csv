"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Your product seems interesting, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite & Interested:** My message expresses interest while clearly stating the offered price is too high.  
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to buy for under $150, ideally closer to Alice's value of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to Alice's value, I still have room to negotiate. Alice is willing to come down from her initial offer, suggesting there's flexibility. I'll try a counteroffer slightly below her current price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you finding a middle ground. I could do $115.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $115, showing movement towards Alice's price while still aiming for a better deal.
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""appreciate"" and ""work for you"" maintains a collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts me in a good position, as it's below Alice's $120 value but above my initial $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice is signaling that she's close to her minimum price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm, leaving me with less favorable options.
* **Acceptable Price:** $130 is within my budget and a reasonable compromise. It's a $20 savings compared to John's offer.
* **Time Constraint:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to buy from John at a higher price."
