"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree this product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation. I believe that's a fair price, and I'm optimistic we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a significant discount. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
