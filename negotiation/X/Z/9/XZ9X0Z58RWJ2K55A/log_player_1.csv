Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree this product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation. I believe that's a fair price, and I'm optimistic we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
