Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is better than selling to John for $10,000. However, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $14,000 is already a competitive price for a product of this caliber.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would $10,000 be too low for you to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer matches John's offer. There's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, but there's also a chance he won't. 

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's best to take the guaranteed $10,000 from Bob now rather than risk him lowering his offer or walking away in the next round."
