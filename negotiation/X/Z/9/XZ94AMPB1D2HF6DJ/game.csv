"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $120? This is a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $115. How about we try $108? I'm getting close to my maximum budget, and I really want to make this deal work.",108.0,Bob,6,
