"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my range.  How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a good deal for you, considering what I know you're willing to pay for the product.",110.0,Alice,7,
