"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a little high for my budget.  Could you do $760,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $795,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to me.",795000.0,Alice,5,
