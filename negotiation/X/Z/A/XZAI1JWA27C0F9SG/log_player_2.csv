"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice at a lower price, closer to her $10,000 valuation.  You're willing to walk away, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
