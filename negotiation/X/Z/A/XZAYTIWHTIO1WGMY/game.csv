"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal. How about $850,000? That leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to move closer to your price, how about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
