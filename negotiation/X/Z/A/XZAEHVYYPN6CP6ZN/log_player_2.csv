{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong opening move to show I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,450,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price below my maximum budget.  This should hopefully encourage Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and only $50,000 above my maximum.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from Alice.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my offer again or decide to stop negotiating altogether. Buying from John would be my last resort if Alice rejects my final counteroffer."
