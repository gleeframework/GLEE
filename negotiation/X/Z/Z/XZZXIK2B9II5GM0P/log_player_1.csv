"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,500,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1300000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 to make this deal work. Let's find a solution that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1250000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1150000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John.  Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm concerned that we're going to reach an impasse.  John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is above my minimum and gives me a more secure outcome.  I'll move on to John and avoid the risk of continuing a potentially fruitless negotiation with Bob."
