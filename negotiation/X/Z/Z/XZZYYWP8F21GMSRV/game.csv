"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit out of my budget. How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $137.50.",137.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $115 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $137.50, so I'm counteroffering at $126.25.",126.25,Alice,5,
