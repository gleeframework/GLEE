Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $150, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value, and if not, how much he's willing to offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $100. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a good compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $120 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, but I really need to get closer to my asking price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $125, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $125 is getting close, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate one last time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $125 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $127.50, but this is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to waste any more time. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 127.50}
