Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive tone and expressing confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion and willing to hear Bob's counteroffers.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my profit by:

* **Setting a high initial price:** This creates a starting point for negotiation that is closer to my desired outcome.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By setting a price higher than my minimum, I have the flexibility to adjust my offer based on Bob's responses.
* **Staying informed of John's offer:**  I'll keep in mind that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $12,000, which serves as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it meets my needs.  Since I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay the same amount, there's no incentive to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale."
