"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of its worth. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your position, the product's value truly lies closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that the price is a bit steep for my current budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $1,600,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing your seriousness about this purchase, and I want to make this work. However, I can't go as low as $1,600,000. My final offer is $1,675,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and a fair price for this valuable product.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
