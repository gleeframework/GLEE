Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value. This increases the chances of Bob perceiving a ""deal"" if he manages to negotiate down slightly.
* **Respectful Negotiation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and invites open communication, fostering a positive negotiation environment.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while maintaining a strong fallback option with John."
