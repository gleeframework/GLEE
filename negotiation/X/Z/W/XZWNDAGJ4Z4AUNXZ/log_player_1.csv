{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price above what Bob values the product at, but it's still below my minimum. This allows for some wiggle room in the negotiation and potentially allows me to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a fair offer, it's a bit below what I'm hoping to get for it. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $105. That's the lowest I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not confident that Bob will budge further. It's not worth risking a prolonged negotiation for a price that's still lower than what John is offering. I'll sell to John to guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
