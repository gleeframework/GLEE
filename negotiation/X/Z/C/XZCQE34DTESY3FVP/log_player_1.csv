Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him some room to negotiate.  By offering a price that's higher than what John would pay, I'm trying to encourage Bob to accept the offer without having to go through multiple rounds of counteroffers. However, I'm also leaving room for negotiation if Bob does not accept the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $9,500, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,800 is only $200 below my floor price of $10,000. It's a good deal for both of us. Continuing the negotiation risks losing Bob as a buyer and ending up with John's offer of $10,000. I'll accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
