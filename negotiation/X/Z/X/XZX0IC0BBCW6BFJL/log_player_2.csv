I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which is $975,000. However, I'm also considering the urgency of selling this product, and I'm not sure if I want to go through another round. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at $975,000.

I've reached my limit. Alice is still asking for more than I'm comfortable with, even after multiple rounds of negotiation.  I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $800,000.  It's a better deal for me than what Alice is offering."
