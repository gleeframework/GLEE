"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate a lower price or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer.  This leaves room for negotiation and might encourage Alice to move closer to my ideal price range.
* **Polite & Direct:**  The message is polite but clearly states my position. 
* **Target in Mind:** My goal is to pay as little as possible while still staying below my $10,000 limit. This offer gives me a good starting point to negotiate from."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but I can still try to negotiate a bit further. Accepting $10,200 would mean overpaying compared to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,700? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9700
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($10,200) and my previous counteroffer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Below John's Offer:** This counteroffer keeps me below my alternative option of buying from John for $10,000.
* **Sense of Urgency (Implied):**  By offering a specific price and calling it a ""fair compromise,"" I'm subtly suggesting this is a good deal and encouraging Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,700 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has gone up in price instead of down. This suggests she is firm on a price point that's not favorable to me.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a low chance of success and risks losing me the guaranteed deal with John for $10,000.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting John's offer provides a quicker resolution and certainty."
