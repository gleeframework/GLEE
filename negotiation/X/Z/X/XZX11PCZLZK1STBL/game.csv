"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I can purchase this product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  To make it worth my while to buy from you, I would need a discount.  Would you be willing to accept $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you have other options, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I can meet you at $950,000, which is a 5% discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
