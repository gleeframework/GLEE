"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to build rapport.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's better than his initial value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **There's room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for a price that meets my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $120 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go too far down. 
* **Midpoint offer:** Offering $130 (the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's) demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive and friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to keep my spending within a specific limit. Could we perhaps agree on $125 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he's moved closer to my minimum, $125 is still below my desired price.
* **Plenty of rounds left:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  If things don't work out with Bob, I can always sell to John and ensure a good return."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're looking for a deal, and I'm happy to work with you, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down to $135, which is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive and firm tone:** I'm staying friendly but firm in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly settle on $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $130 is only $20 less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be pragmatic.  It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** If I reject this offer, I can still sell to John for $150.  However, I'm risking another few rounds of negotiation with Bob that may not lead to a higher price.  It's better to accept the $130 and secure a sale."
