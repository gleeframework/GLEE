"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $125. Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $125 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $160, which is a good compromise.  Let's close this deal.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not there yet.  $160 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $145.  This is my final offer, let's close this deal.",145.0,Alice,7,
