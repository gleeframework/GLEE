,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle between $125 and my initial offer of $150? I can offer it to you for $137.50. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",137.5,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle between $130.50 and my previous offer of $133.75? I can offer it to you for $132.125. This is my final concession, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",132.125,Alice,9,
