"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $12,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
