"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000 yet. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",14000.0,Alice,5,
