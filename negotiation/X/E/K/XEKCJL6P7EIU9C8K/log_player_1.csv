""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party waiting."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a price higher than that allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for Alice.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning another interested party (John) creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.
* **Justification of value:** While we don't explicitly state why the product is worth this much to Bob, the language implies a deep understanding of his needs and the product's value proposition.

This offer aims to maximize profit while leaving some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
