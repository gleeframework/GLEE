{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob first allows us to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,100,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving us room for negotiation.
    *  Attractive enough to potentially entice Bob, as it's still less than John's offer.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer adds pressure for Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  How we proceed depends on Bob's response and potential counter-offers.  We need to be prepared to negotiate while keeping our bottom line ($1,200,000) in mind."
