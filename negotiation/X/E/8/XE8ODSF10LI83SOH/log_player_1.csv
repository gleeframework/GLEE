{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

This initial offer starts at a price higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a back-and-forth. If he doesn't bite, I can always offer a lower price or turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a better offer than John's, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would still be a great deal for you and would allow me to achieve a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and it's a good compromise. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
