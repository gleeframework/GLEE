Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,300,000 before exploring other options."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting near your minimum ($1,500,000) might scare him off. This offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Alternative:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly implies you have another buyer (John) lined up, pressuring Bob to act.
* **Strategic positioning:** This price gives you significant negotiating room. If Bob negotiates, you can potentially still land a deal significantly higher than his perceived value and closer to your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response and gauge his interest level."
