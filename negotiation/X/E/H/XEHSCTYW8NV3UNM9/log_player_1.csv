"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, but I'm also leaving the door open to negotiation. This lets Bob know I'm willing to work with him, but I also don't want to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm interested in purchasing it, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy he's interested, $95 is too low for me. I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm showing flexibility by reducing my offer.  This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This aligns better with my budget. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the highest he's offered so far and is within the range of what I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer more, it's better to secure a sale than risk losing him entirely or having to sell to John at a lower price."
