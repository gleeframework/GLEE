Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $600,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to negotiate, so I propose a price of $1,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
