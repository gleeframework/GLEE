Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's of great value and would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to feel like he got a deal, even though it's near his maximum. 
* **Avoid a Counter-Offer:**  By starting high, but reasonable, we increase the chance Bob will accept immediately. A counter-offer could lead to a price lower than John's offer. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes the potential profit while still ensuring a sale at the minimum acceptable price."
