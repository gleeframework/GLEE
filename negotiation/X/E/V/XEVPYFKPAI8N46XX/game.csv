"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1,050,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider that price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
