"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be a great asset to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the benefits it offers.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,900,000 is a more reasonable offer. I'd like to discuss further and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,900,000 is close, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to see $1,975,000.  I believe that reflects the value of the product while recognizing your position.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $1,850,000 is as low as I'm willing to go. I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle again, but I'm not willing to go any higher than this price.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
