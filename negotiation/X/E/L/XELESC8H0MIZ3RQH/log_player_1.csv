Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price above Bob's perceived value, but still below your minimum acceptable price. It gives room for potential negotiation and keeps the possibility of selling to John as a backup option if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than your minimum acceptable price, but it's closer than your initial offer.  Rejecting it keeps the negotiation going, allowing you to potentially secure a higher price.  The threat of selling to John provides leverage in this process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $137.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $137.50 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your preferred target.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a better outcome, and the negotiation has reached a point where further concessions may not yield a significantly better offer."
