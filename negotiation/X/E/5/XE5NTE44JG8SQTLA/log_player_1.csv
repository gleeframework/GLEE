Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I propose a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing specific details, the message hints at the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Urgency:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without much negotiation.
* **Fallback Option:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, so even if Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out.

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob and your risk tolerance, you might adjust the price and message."
