Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, we're still a bit far apart. To be frank, I have a hard limit of $1,450,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his hard limit is $1,450,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer.  Since John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, it makes the most financial sense to take the guaranteed sale."
