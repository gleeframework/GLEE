"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll be interested in. It's valued at $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to accept $10,500 for the product.  This way, we both get a fair price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. I'm confident we can work out a deal that works for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,400 for the product.  This would give us both a fair deal and ensure I don't lose too much on the sale.",10400.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle at $10,350?",10350.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,350 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $10,375. This would allow us to close the deal fairly and I can still make a decent profit on the sale.",10375.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going up to $10,375. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,187.50, but that's as high as I can go. Can we consider that?",10187.5,Bob,8,
