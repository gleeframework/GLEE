"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential benefits from owning it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $9,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's my absolute top.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500. Considering your willingness to go up to $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,750. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, you've already gotten a better price than your initial target of $12,000, and a counteroffer from you could risk Alice walking away.  It's worth accepting her offer and getting a good deal."
