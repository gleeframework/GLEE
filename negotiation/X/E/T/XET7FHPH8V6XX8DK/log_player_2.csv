"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves plenty of room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about buying but want a price closer to my ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to get a better deal.  Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? "",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer suggests a price exactly between our last two offers, signaling a willingness to compromise but also holding onto a lower price point. 
* **Respectful but firm:** The message maintains a polite and collaborative tone, but clearly shows I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $10,250? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Concessions:** Alice's counteroffers are getting smaller, indicating she's nearing her bottom line. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** We still have five rounds left, and I believe there's room to bring the price down a bit further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need the price to work for me. Could you consider $10,000 even? That would be a great way to wrap this up."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Offer:** This offer is Alice's exact valuation of the product. It's possible she'll accept to avoid further negotiation.
* **Deadline Pressure:** By round 6, the approaching 10-round limit might push Alice to accept a less profitable offer rather than risk losing the sale entirely.
* **Alternative Option:**  We're still prepared to walk away and buy from John for $12,000 if Alice remains firm."
