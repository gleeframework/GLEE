"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? ",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $10,250? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need the price to work for me. Could you consider $10,000 even? That would be a great way to wrap this up.",10000.0,Bob,6,
