Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose his potential higher valuation.

**The Strategy**

The key is to balance ambition with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 increases the chance of rejection, while aiming too low leaves potential profit on the table. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects its potential to significantly benefit your business."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Positioning:** The message highlights the product's ""exclusive"" nature and ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price.
* **Price Point:** $1,350,000  is a strong starting point. It allows for some negotiation downward while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum. 
* **Rationale:** By offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of acceptance while still achieving a significant return on your investment.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  You can adjust the message and price based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
