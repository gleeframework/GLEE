"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's estimated value but still leaves some room for negotiation. This allows for potential compromise without immediately jeopardizing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject the offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,800. However, I'm still stuck at $10,500. It's the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I may have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is at his maximum, I'm still not at my minimum. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a bit more in the next round. There are still rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I understand that $10,500 is your limit, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $10,700?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would allow me to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10700}
