"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is asking for $11,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. Alice has come down to $10,800, which is closer to his limit, but he can still try to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice will come down a bit more to secure the deal, especially since Bob has already shown his willingness to pay a bit more than his initial $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,800. However, I'm still stuck at $10,500. It's the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I understand that $10,500 is your limit, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $10,700?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would allow me to make this deal work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $10,700, which is only $700 more than Bob's limit.  At this point, it makes sense for Bob to accept the offer.  It's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds, and he risks losing the deal altogether if he keeps rejecting offers."
