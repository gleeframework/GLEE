"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand you think $90 is a fair price, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, as I can always buy it from John for $120.",95.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,105.0
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, so I'm offering it to you for $102.50. This is my final offer.",102.5,Alice,5,,
