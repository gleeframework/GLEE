"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $110 is better than buying from John for $120. 
* Even though you can save an additional $10 by rejecting Alice's offer and waiting to buy from John, there's no guarantee that John will still have the product available when you reject Alice's offer. It's safer to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
