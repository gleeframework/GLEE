Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me some leeway to potentially counter Bob's offers if he tries to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, $9,000 is still significantly lower than my ideal price. I want to try to get closer to my target of $12,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $10,500. This is a compromise from my original offer of $12,000, but it's still a good amount for me and is higher than Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but that I also value the product."

```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original target price of $12,000, Bob has stuck to his offer of $9,000.  It's worth noting that John is only willing to pay $8,000.  Since $9,000 is a higher price than what John would pay, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
