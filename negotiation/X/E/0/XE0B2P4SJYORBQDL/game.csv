"I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand that $10,000 is high, but I'm also confident in the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 just wouldn't cover my costs.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this product, but $7,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $8,500. It's a compromise, and it allows me to move forward with this sale.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get as close to $8,000 as possible. Would you be willing to come down to $8,200?",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,300? That way, we both get a deal that feels fair.  Let's close this out!",8300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,300 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, so I'm going to make one more offer. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,8,
