"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,125,000. This price still leaves room for you to gain significant value from the product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. However,  $1,095,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise again.  I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and I feel it's a fair compromise.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
