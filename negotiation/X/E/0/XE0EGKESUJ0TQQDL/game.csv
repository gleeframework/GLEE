"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it offers.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $10,000. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
