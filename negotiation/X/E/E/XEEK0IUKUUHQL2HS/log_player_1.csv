Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120), but still below Bob's estimated worth of the product ($120). This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
