Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Alice is already down to $135, which is within my budget. Accepting the offer is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the product to another buyer."
