"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,950,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $1,950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,725,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",1725000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I can't quite meet that $1,725,000 price.  Would you be open to $1,462,500?",1462500.0,Bob,6,
