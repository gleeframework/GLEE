"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by acknowledging Alice's offer but indicates it's too high. He then presents a counteroffer of $10,500, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still above Alice's minimum value. This shows Bob is serious about buying but wants to secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $11,000 is a better deal than John's offer, it's still not as good as his initial counteroffer of $10,500. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference at $10,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more assertive approach, highlighting that Alice's offer is still too high. He proposes a compromise at $10,750, which is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still pushing for a lower price."
