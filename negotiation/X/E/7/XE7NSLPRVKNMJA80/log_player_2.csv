{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me. It's worth $150 to Alice. Even though $130 is close, it's not worth it to me. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice $115. This is still a fair price for her since it's above her cost. I'm hoping she'll accept, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my limit of $120.  It's not worth risking further negotiation when I can get the product from John for my target price."
