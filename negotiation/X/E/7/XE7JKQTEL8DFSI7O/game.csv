"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, considering your interest. Let me know if you're open to that.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
