{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's halfway between my minimum price of $10,000 and Bob's maximum value of $15,000. It gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  I'm also adding a friendly message to make the negotiation more approachable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $500 above my minimum acceptable price. I'm not going to sell it for such a small profit.  I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
