"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000? This would still give you a good deal considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to my initial offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $12,000. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer again and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation."
