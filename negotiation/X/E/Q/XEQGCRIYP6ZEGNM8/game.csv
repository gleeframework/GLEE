"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000? This would still give you a good deal considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to my initial offer. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
