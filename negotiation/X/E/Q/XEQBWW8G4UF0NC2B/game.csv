"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
