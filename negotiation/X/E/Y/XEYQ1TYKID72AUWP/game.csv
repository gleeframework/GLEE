"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects its value and allows us to both make a fair deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To meet you closer to your price point, I'm willing to let it go for $910,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",910000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $910,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Considering the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a fair deal, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle on $895,000.  This slight adjustment bridges the gap and represents a competitive price for a product of this caliber.",895000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $895,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $885,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!",885000.0,Bob,6,
