"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects its value and allows us to both make a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To meet you closer to your price point, I'm willing to let it go for $910,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it is still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob has 7 rounds remaining, and there's potential to push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $910,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Considering the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a fair deal, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle on $895,000.  This slight adjustment bridges the gap and represents a competitive price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has 5 rounds remaining, and a slight adjustment from Alice could bring the price down to a more comfortable level.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $895,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $885,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 885000}
