Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that's slightly higher than what it's worth to him. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $120.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $90. Since this is lower than what the product is worth to me ($150), I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer of my own.

I'll increase the price slightly, to $110, which is still lower than what I'm willing to accept, but higher than Bob's offer. This will give Bob an opportunity to reconsider his offer or make a new one.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's made another offer of $105. Since this is still lower than what the product is worth to me ($150), I'll reject his offer again and make another counteroffer.

I'll increase the price slightly, to $125, which is still lower than what I'm willing to accept, but higher than Bob's offer. This will give Bob an opportunity to reconsider his offer or make a new one.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my counteroffer again, and now he's made another offer of $98. Since this is even lower than before, I'll reject his offer again.

At this point, I've already rejected several offers, and Bob's offers have been decreasing. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Considering this, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $150, as it's the best option for me.
