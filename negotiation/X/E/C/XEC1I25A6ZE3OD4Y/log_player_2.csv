"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  $90 is still too high for him, given his $120 limit and the fact he can get the product from John for $120. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive and start the negotiation with a relatively low offer. He's aiming to meet Alice halfway, knowing her minimum is likely around $80. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying but wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her offer from $90 to $95, which is moving in the wrong direction for Bob. While he can get the product from John for $120, he's still trying to get a better deal from Alice.  He'll likely make another counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground again. He's increased his offer from $75 to $85, which is a significant increase but still below Alice's latest offer of $95. This shows he's willing to compromise but is still pushing for a better price.  He's also aware that he has limited rounds, so he's trying to find a deal before he needs to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Although he's running out of rounds, he's still holding out for a lower price.  He's hoping to find a deal closer to his ideal range of $80-85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final push before resorting to buying from John. He's raised his offer to $88, which is very close to Alice's latest offer of $92. This shows he's serious about closing the deal but still wants a slight price reduction. It's a risky move, but he's hoping Alice will accept to avoid further negotiation and the potential of him going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has dropped her offer back down to $90, which is the same as her initial offer. While Bob is still hoping for a slightly lower price, he needs to be mindful of time. With only three rounds left, he's at a crossroads.  

* **Going to John:**  This would guarantee him the product but at a significantly higher price of $120.
* **Counteroffering again:**  This risks further negotiation and potentially reaching a point where he has no choice but to go to John anyway.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $90 is the most rational choice. It's a decent price, and he can secure the product without risking a last-minute jump to John."
