{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay given his perceived value of $100. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum,  $140 is still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  It's better to sell to John and guarantee the $150 minimum."
