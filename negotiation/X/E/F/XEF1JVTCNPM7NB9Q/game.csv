"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $900,000.  This gives you a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve a strong return on my investment. Let's talk about this further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
