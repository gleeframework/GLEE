"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for my budget.  How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
