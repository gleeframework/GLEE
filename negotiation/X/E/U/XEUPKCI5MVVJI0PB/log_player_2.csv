"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to move the negotiation significantly closer to my ideal price, but still leaves room for further bargaining if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $85? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm happy with. Let's try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but also sets a firm target price. This leaves some room for negotiation if Alice is completely unwilling to go that low, but keeps me well below my alternative of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $77. How about we try $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me halfway. While I could try to haggle further, $82 is a reasonable price and saves me $18 compared to buying from John. It's time to accept and get the product."
