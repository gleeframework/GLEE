Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! However, $72.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $92. How about we try $87.50?

You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that works for you. She's consistently staying above your maximum price point. It's better to secure the product from John at $80 than risk the price going up further with Alice."
