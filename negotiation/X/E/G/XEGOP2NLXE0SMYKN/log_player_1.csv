I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves a good margin for me.  I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to Bob and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit lower than I'd prefer, it's still a good deal. I'm running the risk of further negotiation, and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob, or even losing him as a buyer altogether. It's also possible that John could change his mind or I could have trouble finding another buyer.  It seems like a better strategy to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
