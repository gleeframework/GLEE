Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. I'm confident in the product's value and want to maximize my profit.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can push for a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $880,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $860,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant profit for me and it seems unlikely that I can get a much better price by continuing to negotiate. The risk of losing Bob and ending up with only John's offer ($800,000) is too high."
