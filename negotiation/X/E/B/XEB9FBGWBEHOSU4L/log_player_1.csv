Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification for the price:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing my bottom line. This might encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains open for further discussion, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer if the initial price is too high.

By starting high, I maximize my potential profit. If Bob accepts, I make a significant gain. If he rejects the offer or negotiates down, I can still fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
