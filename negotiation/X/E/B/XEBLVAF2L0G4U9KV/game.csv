"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us. Considering the product's value to you, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my target price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000 and its value to you is $1,000,000.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
