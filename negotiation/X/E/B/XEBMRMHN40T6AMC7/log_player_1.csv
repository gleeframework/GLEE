{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate downwards if needed. It also emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, and I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and a significant improvement over his previous offers.  It's a fair price, and I'm comfortable accepting it.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and it avoids further negotiation."
