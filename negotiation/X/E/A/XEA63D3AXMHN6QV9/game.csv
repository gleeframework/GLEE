"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds a great deal of value for you.  This price allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still below what I need to achieve my desired profit margin. However, I'm willing to come down slightly. I'd be willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. This reflects the significant value it holds for you, and it also allows us both to reach an agreeable agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
