Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still below what I need to achieve my desired profit margin. However, I'm willing to come down slightly. I'd be willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. This reflects the significant value it holds for you, and it also allows us both to reach an agreeable agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.
