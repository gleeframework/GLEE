"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let me start by suggesting a price of $130 for the product. I'm confident we can negotiate to a satisfactory outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to you ($130 vs $150).  You want to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $120 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. This allows us to both feel fairly compensated for this transaction. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is still a good deal for me as the product is worth $150.  While I could try to negotiate further, I'm not sure if I can get a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for $150."
