Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering a price of $2,000,000 allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.  
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price is not unreasonable, but it also leaves room for Bob to counteroffer.  
* **Setting Expectations:**  The message clearly states the price and emphasizes the product's value. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I have a backup buyer in John, so I can afford to be firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **John is a safety net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will benefit both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:**  I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer but instead making a counter-offer with a clear explanation. I emphasize the ""true value"" of the product, which helps justify my higher price.
* **Compromise and Win-Win:** The counter-offer of $1,700,000 shows that I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring I make a profit. I frame it as a ""fair compromise"" that will benefit both of us.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even with this counter-offer, there's still some room for further negotiation if Bob is truly interested.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while also asserting my value and maintaining a firm negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1550000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **No Significant Upside:** Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but it's not likely to be substantial enough to justify risking losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on, and it's not guaranteed to lead to a better outcome. 
* **John as Backup:** I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I won't be left with nothing if the deal with Bob falls through.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision at this point, balancing the potential for a slightly higher price against the risks of further negotiation and the certainty of securing a deal close to my minimum."
