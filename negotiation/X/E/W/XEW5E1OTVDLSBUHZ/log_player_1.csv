"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This is a bit above Bob's valuation, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit from the initial offer, but still above Bob's initial offer and my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about selling to him but also that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to budge a little further in the next round.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm continuing to negotiate with Bob.  This offer is closer to his last offer and to my minimum acceptable price. It shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I still have a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit further, showing flexibility. This offer is still above Bob's last offer, but it's getting closer to his valuation.  We're nearing the middle ground, and I'm hoping he'll accept this time."
