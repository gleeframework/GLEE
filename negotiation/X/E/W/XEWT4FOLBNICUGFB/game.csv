"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to $750,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
