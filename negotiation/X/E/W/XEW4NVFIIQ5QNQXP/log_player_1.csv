Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 is significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let's find a middle ground - how about $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.
