"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $12,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $13,500. I'm confident that this price is a fair and reasonable offer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm making a decent profit, so I can only go up to $13,250. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
