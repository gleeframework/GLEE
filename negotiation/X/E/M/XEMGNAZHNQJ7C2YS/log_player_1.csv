"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and increases the chance of Bob accepting. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob emphasizes the potential benefit of the deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target higher:** I want to try to squeeze out a bit more profit than Bob's offer.  $13,000 is still a good deal for me, but I'm not in a rush to settle. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Rejecting allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, giving us a chance to find a middle ground.
* **Not desperate:**  Even though Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm happy to negotiate, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good price.
* **Reinforce value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to him to emphasize the deal's potential benefits.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation productive."
