"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob should try to negotiate a lower price. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Initial Offer:** Alice's offer was too high, so Bob needs to negotiate a lower price.
* **Counteroffer:**  $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's still above Alice's minimum price of $12,000, but it's within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm happy to negotiate, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer. 

Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product for a price lower than John's offer, while still saving money.  Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of a breakdown is higher."
