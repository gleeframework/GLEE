"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer, the value of this product is quite significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but not to $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $875,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving us both a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
