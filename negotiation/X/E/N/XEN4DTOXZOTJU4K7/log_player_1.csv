"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and moving towards our desired price point. We're still early in the negotiation, and holding firm now could yield a better result in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,285,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer, we are still above John's offer and Bob is consistently increasing his offer. Holding firm shows we are serious about the value and could push him closer to $1,300,000 in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a number that works. To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $1,295,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1295000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and need to signal to Bob that we're firm on our price. By stating this is our final offer, we create urgency and may encourage him to accept a price higher than his previous offers, while still staying above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,280,000. This is my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and it's below our minimum acceptable price.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer significantly in the remaining two rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum desired price and avoids the risk of Bob not budging."
