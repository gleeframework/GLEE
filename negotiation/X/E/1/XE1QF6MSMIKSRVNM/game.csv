"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's get this done!",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking $1,475,000 would be a more comfortable price for me. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",1475000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for the best price, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $1,475,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this a win-win, I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen!",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose $1,512,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1512500.0,Bob,6,
