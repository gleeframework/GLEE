"Hi Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Is that something you'd consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50.  Let me know if that works for you.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $98.50.  Let's see if we can make this work.",98.5,Bob,6,
