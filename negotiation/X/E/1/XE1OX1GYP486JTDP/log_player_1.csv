Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $140. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to me. This is a good starting point to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and asking if he's interested, which sets a more positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm offering a price closer to what Bob offered, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm also reiterating my appreciation for his interest to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering below my minimum price. While it's closer, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'll counter again, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and hopefully will encourage him to do the same.  I'm also keeping the tone friendly and positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $98.50.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to sell to Bob, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to sell to John for $120, as that meets my minimum requirement.  It's important to stick to your boundaries and not settle for less than you're comfortable with."
