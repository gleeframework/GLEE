"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could we settle around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me. This product is valuable, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $850,000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll be selling to John.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,5,
