"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It sets a high bar:**  It immediately communicates that I believe the product is valuable.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  I can lower the price if needed, giving me flexibility.
* **It's above my minimum:** I'm comfortable walking away with $8,000 from John, so I can be assertive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm going to counter with a higher offer, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800.  This is a compromise - it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close and it's better than selling to John for $8,000.  There's still a chance he'll counter again, but I'm feeling confident about securing this deal."
