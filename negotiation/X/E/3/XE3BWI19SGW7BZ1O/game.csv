I'm excited to offer you this unique product for a great deal! I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's still below its true value.,15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14000. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $14000. Would you be willing to consider $13000? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, $13000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $14500. It's a fair price that should be reasonable for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $13000.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $14500. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you halfway from your previous offer of $13500. Let's try $14250. It's a fair price that should be reasonable for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll pay $14000 for the product. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",14000.0,Bob,8,
