,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $108? That's the best I can do.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $108 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down just a bit further, but I need to at least get $110 for it.  Is that something you can work with?",110.0,Alice,5,
