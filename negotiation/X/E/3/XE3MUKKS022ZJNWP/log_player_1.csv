{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it!  I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation if he rejects it.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message, hoping to build rapport and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $108? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $108 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more. There's always a chance he'll come up with a better offer, and even if he doesn't, I can still sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $108 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down just a bit further, but I need to at least get $110 for it.  Is that something you can work with?"", ""product_price"": 110}
