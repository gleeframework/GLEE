"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to go down a little more. How about we settle on $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows you to stay within your budget.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away from this deal, but I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $9,200. If you can do that, I'll take the product. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer of $8,000.",9200.0,Bob,6,
