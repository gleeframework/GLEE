"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85? I think that's a fair price considering your value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $87?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is a reasonable compromise. It allows me to earn a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
