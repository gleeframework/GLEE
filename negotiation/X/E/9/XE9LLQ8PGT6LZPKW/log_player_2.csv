"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to secure the product for a slightly lower price. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that still allows for a profitable transaction for you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached a point where Alice's offer is only slightly better than John's.  While there's a chance he could negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and the potential for prolonged negotiations outweighs the potential savings of $50,000.  It's more efficient and secure for Bob to purchase from John at this point."
