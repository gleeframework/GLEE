"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price of $120. I'm confident it's worth it to me, and I'll see how Bob responds.  If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing with him or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only pay $105. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I can only pay $110. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $110 is still a bit lower than my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and I'm running out of time. I don't want to risk losing Bob completely or having to settle for John's offer, which is only $10 more.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
