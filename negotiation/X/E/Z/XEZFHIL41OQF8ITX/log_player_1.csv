Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob a good deal, while still leaving me some room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm hopeful that he'll accept, but if he rejects, I'm prepared to counteroffer or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$90 is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see that we're both being reasonable and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $105 is a decent compromise. It's above my minimum, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome.  I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
