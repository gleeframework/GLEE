It's always good to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better price.  $6,000 is a good start, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $4,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. We can negotiate from here."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$5,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to reject and see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $4,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Alice's offer again. While $5,200 is getting closer to my target, I think I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $4,800.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to show Alice I'm willing to be flexible."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, $5,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to accept Alice's offer. I've saved a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. It's important to know when to stop pushing for a lower price and take a good deal when it's presented."
