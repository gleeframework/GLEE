Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I find the product appealing, my budget constraints prevent me from accepting the current offer. Could you consider lowering the price to $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1080000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1060000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us both.",1060000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1060000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1080000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,7,
