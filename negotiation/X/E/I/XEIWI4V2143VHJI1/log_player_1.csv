Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, as it's significantly below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value and leaves some room for negotiation. It also shows Bob I'm serious about selling the product, but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value, but I'm not sure if he'll go higher. There's no guarantee he'll accept a counteroffer, and it's likely we'll be going back and forth for a while.  John is offering the same price, but with certainty, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. I'm going to sell to John."
