"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is high but leaves room for negotiation. I'm starting with a high price, hoping to secure a good deal while leaving room for Bob to counteroffer.  It's important to be firm but open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000 plus a profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can reach a more favorable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 isn't quite meeting my expectations. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've given it some thought and would like to counter with an offer of $1025000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is above my minimum desired price of $800,000 and represents a good profit margin.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure a sale and avoid risking a further drop in price or having to sell to John for a lower amount."
