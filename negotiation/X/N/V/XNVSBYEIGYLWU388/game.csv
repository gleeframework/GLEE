"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $715,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",715000.0,Alice,5,
