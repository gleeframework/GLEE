"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money.",11000.0,Alice,5,
