"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to  $600,000 would be more realistic.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I've done my research and know that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Could you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on my investment. Let's try $850,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is getting close, but I have a firm limit I need to stick to. Would you consider $775,000?  That's the best I can do.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $775,000, Bob. I think we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $850,000. Let's try $812,500. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair for both of us.",812500.0,Alice,7,
