{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  You can likely get the product for less, especially since you have a backup option with John. 
* **Negotiating is worth it.**  Even a small reduction in price can save you a significant amount of money. 

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your desired range."

{""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  A counteroffer of $900,000 is a reasonable starting point. It shows you're serious about buying, but also that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This price is still below Alice's minimum value, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to come down further.

**Next Steps:**

* **Prepare for Negotiation:**  Be ready to negotiate further based on Alice's response.  
* **Consider John's Offer:**  Remember, you have a safety net with John's offer if Alice's price becomes too high."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  A counteroffer of $925,000 shows a willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's a slight increase from your previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  This price is closer to Alice's minimum value and could make a deal more likely.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  You still have John's offer as a backup, which keeps you in a strong negotiating position.

**Next Steps:**

* **Prepare for Negotiation:**  Be ready to negotiate further based on Alice's response.  
* **Consider John's Offer:**  Remember, you have a safety net with John's offer if Alice's price becomes too high."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer is very close to your ideal price range, making it a good deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** You have fewer rounds left, and further negotiation might not yield much more savings. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John will cost you significantly more.

**Next Steps:**

While accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this round, keep in mind you can still try to negotiate a slightly lower price in future rounds if you have the time."
