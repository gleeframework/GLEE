Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the exclusivity of this offer, I'm proposing a price of $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Anchoring:**  A high initial offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, making a price closer to $12,000 seem more reasonable later.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the initial offer.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
