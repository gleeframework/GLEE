Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be interested in paying $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a good deal for you, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 125}
