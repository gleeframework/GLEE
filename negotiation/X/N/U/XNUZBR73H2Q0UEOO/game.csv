"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product that holds considerable value. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $1000000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
