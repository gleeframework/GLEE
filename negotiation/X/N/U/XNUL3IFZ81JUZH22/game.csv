"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value is quite a bit higher than your offer.  I could consider letting it go for $11,500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
