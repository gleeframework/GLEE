``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a decent discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it still leaves some room for negotiation and potential profit. I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer, and I'm ready to discuss any counteroffers he may have.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low.  I need to make at least $15,000 to consider selling.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little bit.  I'm not going to sell to John just yet, as I still think there's potential to get a better price from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to still make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm going to try to counteroffer again and see if I can get him to come up just a little more. I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I'm determined to see if I can make a better deal with Bob."
