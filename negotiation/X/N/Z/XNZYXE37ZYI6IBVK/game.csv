"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive pricing. However, I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000? This would give you a good return while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1,125,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $1,150,000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
