"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive pricing. However, I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000? This would give you a good return while allowing me to stay within my financial limits."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  While Alice has come down in price, $1,175,000 is still higher than Bob's target of $1,000,000.  There's still some room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1,125,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $1,150,000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target of $1,000,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate could lead to more rounds of back-and-forth, wasting time.  Given that John is offering the product at Bob's maximum budget, it's more efficient to buy from John."
