"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```explanation:
Alice's first offer is a good starting point, but there's a significant chance we can negotiate a better price.  It's too early to accept her first offer. Buying from John would mean overpaying significantly. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While $1,000,000 is a fair price, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you be willing to consider $800,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

```explanation: 
Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer leaves room for negotiation. We're aiming for a price closer to our ideal range while still being realistic enough that Alice might consider it. 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

```explanation:
Alice is moving in the right direction, but $900,000 is still a bit high.  We have room to negotiate further, especially since she's clearly willing to compromise. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point that works for me. Would you consider $850,000? That would really help me make this purchase work."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

```explanation:
We're nudging the price closer to our goal. By expressing that this price would ""help make the purchase work,"" we're subtly signaling that this might be our final offer without being too aggressive. 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

```explanation:
While not ideal, this is Alice's ""final offer"" and it's close enough to our acceptable range.  Continuing to negotiate risks jeopardizing the deal and forcing us to buy from John at a much higher price. It's best to accept the deal now and secure a significant savings compared to John's offer.
