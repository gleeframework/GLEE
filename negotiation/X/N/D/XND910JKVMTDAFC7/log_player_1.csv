"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive tone encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Reason for Price:**  While I don't have to justify the price, I'm suggesting it's a ""great deal"" to potentially appeal to Bob. 

**Strategy:**  This initial offer is intended to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my target. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer, but I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Round:**  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. I'll aim for a compromise between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  My counteroffer is $5 higher than Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also holding firm on my value.
* **Compromise:**  I emphasize that $95 is a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the discussion.

**Strategy:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll adjust my strategy based on his next offer, keeping in mind the option of selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price point.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, even if it means a few more rounds.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'm hoping to get a slightly better price from Bob.

**Next Round:** I'll make a counteroffer, likely somewhere between Bob's $85 and my previous offer of $95. I'll try to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $90. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both been willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's current offer of $85.  I'm showing a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Justification:** I'm justifying the price by mentioning the value of the product and the fact that both of us have been negotiating in good faith.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:** I believe this counteroffer is a fair price for both of us. If Bob rejects it, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy.  I'll keep John's offer in mind, but I'm still hoping to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between $85 and $90, at $87.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $87.50 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is tempting,  it's not that much higher than Bob's current offer, and I'm not confident I can get a better price with him.

**Strategy:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale and avoiding further negotiation. The potential for a higher price with John doesn't outweigh the risk of losing the deal with Bob."
