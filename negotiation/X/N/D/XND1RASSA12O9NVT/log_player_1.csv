Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly implies the price is justified without revealing your bottom line.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for you. 
* **Backup Plan:** You're secure knowing John will buy at your desired price if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a professional and appealing offer to Bob."
