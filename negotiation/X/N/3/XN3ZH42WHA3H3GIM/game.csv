"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you recognizing its value to me. However, $9,000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still looking to get a good deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,500. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price, given the value to me and your own asking price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $9,000. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you a compromise at $9,250. It's a fair price considering the value to you and my own asking price. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
