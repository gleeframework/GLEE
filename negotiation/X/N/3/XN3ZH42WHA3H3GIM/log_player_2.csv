# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

You can definitely do better than $9,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting close to my limit."
