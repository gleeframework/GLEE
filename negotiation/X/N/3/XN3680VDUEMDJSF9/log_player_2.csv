"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get close to his desired price.  This aggressive approach might encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $10,200 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his desired price. He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, but still keeping it below his maximum budget. This shows Alice that he's serious about making a deal, but also that he's not willing to pay her full asking price.  By offering a price closer to his desired $9,000, he's trying to nudge Alice towards a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to his $8,000 budget as possible. While $10,000 is tempting, there's still room for negotiation, and he can continue to push for a lower price. He's also aware that he can always buy from John for $8,000 if the deal with Alice falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,750. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he's still trying to get a lower price.  He's making a strong final offer, signaling that he's not willing to negotiate much further.  This could push Alice to accept or counter with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been persistent in negotiating a lower price but is getting close to his maximum budget. Alice is also demonstrating a firm stance by only dropping the price by $100. At this point, Bob is likely to lose more time and potentially risk the product going to another buyer if he continues negotiating with Alice.  He's better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000, as it saves him money and time."
