"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
