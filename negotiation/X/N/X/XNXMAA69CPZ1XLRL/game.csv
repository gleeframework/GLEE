"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $100, Alice.  While $95 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
