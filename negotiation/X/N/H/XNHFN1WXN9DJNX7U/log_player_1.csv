I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than John's offer, I still think I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."

Bob is sticking to his $130 offer and I'm running out of rounds. I'll accept his offer, as it's still better than selling to John."
