"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's worth considering a price of $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a good middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I can do $8,500, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet at a price that works for both of us. I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I also need to consider my own needs. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again, but this time at $8,250.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $8,000. However, I value the quality of your product and I'm willing to offer you $8,100 to make this deal happen.",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $8,100 is still a bit shy of my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be realistic about the value I can get for this product. I can offer it to you for $8,500, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet at a price that works for both of us. I'd like to make one more serious offer, and if that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Alice,7,
