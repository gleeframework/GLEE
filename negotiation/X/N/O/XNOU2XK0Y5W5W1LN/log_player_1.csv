"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000. I'm confident that its value will far exceed this price."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), you set a high anchor. This gives you more room to negotiate down and potentially secure a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Confident Justification:** While the price is high, framing it as a ""unique opportunity"" with a value exceeding the asking price aims to influence Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial high price makes it clear that you're open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob offered your minimum acceptable price.  While you could accept and end the negotiation now, there's a good chance you can negotiate a higher price. You have plenty of rounds left and the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000 provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,800,000 represents a significant discount from my initial valuation.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of this product and the potential returns it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession (but not too much):** You're making a substantial reduction from your initial price to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, you're still well above both your minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By mentioning ""true worth"" and ""potential returns,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits and subtly pushing back against his lower valuation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer aims to bring Bob closer to your desired range while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a good price, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the potential value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your absolute minimum acceptable price.  While you could try to push for more, it's risky. Bob might be at his maximum, and you could lose the deal entirely. Accepting now secures you your minimum and avoids potentially leaving money on the table with a John sale."
