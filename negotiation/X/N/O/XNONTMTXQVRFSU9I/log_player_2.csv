"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to make you a deal on this incredible opportunity, Bob. I think you'll love this product and it will be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,200,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $800,000, which is within your budget. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can buy the product from John and save a substantial amount of money."
