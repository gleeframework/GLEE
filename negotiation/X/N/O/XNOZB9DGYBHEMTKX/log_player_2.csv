(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals Bob's seriousness about buying the product while trying to find a price within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  However, it's getting closer, and Bob might be able to get an even better price with a counteroffer.  Additionally, Bob still has more rounds to negotiate and can use the threat of buying from John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his counteroffer, showing Alice he is serious about buying the product. This offer is still below his maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's closer to Alice's last offer, increasing the chance of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $50,000 above his maximum.  Bob can potentially negotiate a better price with another counteroffer, or if unsuccessful, can always buy from John. With more rounds left, there's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer.  He's offering the maximum he's willing to pay. It's also the same price John is offering.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will buy from John. This creates pressure on Alice to accept, as she risks losing the deal altogether."
