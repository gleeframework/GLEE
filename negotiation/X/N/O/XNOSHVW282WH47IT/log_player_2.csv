Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant, and $2,300,000 is a fair reflection of that. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I believe this offer represents a good balance between its intrinsic worth and a price that makes sense for both of us.
