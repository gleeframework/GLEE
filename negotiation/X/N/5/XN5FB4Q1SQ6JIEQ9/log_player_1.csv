"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and using positive language to encourage Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $10,000 allows for several rounds of counteroffers before I reach my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I have 9 rounds left, and Bob has shown interest.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Using John as leverage:**  The option to sell to John for $8,000 gives me a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob don't go well, I can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,500 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** I'm lowering my price to $9,000, signaling willingness to negotiate but not drastically undercutting my starting price.
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob about the product's value to keep it in the forefront of his mind.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** $9,000 still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8250 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's a good deal considering I've already had to lower my price.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  I only have six rounds left, so continuing to negotiate risks losing a sale altogether.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:**  Even though I'm accepting the offer, there's still a chance Bob might counteroffer again in the next round.  I can always reject that counteroffer and stick with this agreement."
