"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth a bit more than that. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer - let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $14,000. How about $14,250? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have a price in mind, but I'm still stretched at $14,250.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $14,100.  This is the absolute best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can close the deal right now.",14100.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to make a final offer. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $14,100. How about $14,200? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for this exceptional product.",14200.0,Alice,7,
