"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. This means you save $30 compared to buying from John.
* **Alice's offer is better than your alternative:**  While you could get the product from John for $150, Alice's offer is a significantly better deal."
