Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is more than fair. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $1,350,000 or close to it ensures a much higher profit than the $1,000,000 John is offering."
