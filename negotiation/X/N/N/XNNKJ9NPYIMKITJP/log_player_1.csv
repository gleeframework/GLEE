Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but might be tempting enough for him to accept. The ""limited time"" element adds a touch of urgency.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** If Bob outright rejects $145, there's a chance he might counter-offer, giving you another opportunity to negotiate. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit."
