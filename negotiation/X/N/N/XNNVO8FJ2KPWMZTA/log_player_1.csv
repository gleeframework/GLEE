""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it will be very valuable to you."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product to Bob at $119, you are maximizing your potential profit. Bob gets a $1 discount from his perceived value, making it an attractive deal. This strategy gives you the best chance of selling the product for the highest possible price before resorting to John's offer."
