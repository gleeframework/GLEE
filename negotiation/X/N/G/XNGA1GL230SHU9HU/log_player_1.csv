"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This allows room for negotiation while still securing a profit beyond my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids risking further rounds of negotiation. It's also important to consider the time constraint â€“ we're already in round 4, and each round brings us closer to potentially having to sell to John for $800,000."
