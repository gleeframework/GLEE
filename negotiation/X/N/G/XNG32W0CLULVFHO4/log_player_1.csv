"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I am confident I can get a higher price than $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While $77.5 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $77.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $82.50. It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $82.50 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $79? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer of $79 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm concerned we won't reach an agreement.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed $80 from John."
