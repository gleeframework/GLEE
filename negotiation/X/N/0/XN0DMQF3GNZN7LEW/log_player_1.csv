{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer stands until [Set a reasonable deadline], after which I'll be moving forward with another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could net you an additional $400,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($1,400,000) makes it a tempting proposition, as he gains $400,000 in perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:**  Setting a deadline creates urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly rather than overthink the deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning another interested party reinforces the value of your product and the fact that Bob might miss out if he hesitates."
