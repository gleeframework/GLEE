"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while remaining within my financial limits.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation and providing your perspective on the product's value. While I understand your offer, $1,100,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This price reflects a significant concession on my end, while still acknowledging the true potential of this product.  Let me know if this works for you.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product, but $1,950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price is a substantial increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the value this product holds.  I've tried to be flexible, but to be completely transparent, I have a hard limit of $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer at this price. I believe this is more than fair given the product's potential, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and $1,600,000 is a significant amount.  While I value the product's potential, I'm still not able to meet that price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the current market conditions.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
