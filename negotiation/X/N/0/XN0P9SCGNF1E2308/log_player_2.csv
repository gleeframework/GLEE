"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We know we can get it for $120 from John or potentially less from Alice with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still higher than her value. This approach leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Would you be interested in purchasing the product at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down in price, but we're still aiming lower. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $80? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

We're now proposing a price that matches Alice's value for the product. This is a strategic move, as it might be the lowest she's willing to go. It also demonstrates our willingness to negotiate reasonably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unwilling to go down to $80, but she's inching closer. We're still in a good position to negotiate a better price than John's offer. We'll continue to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to do $86?"",
""product_price"": 86
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($92) and our last counter-offer ($80). This shows we are willing to compromise but also keeps us firmly below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $86. I'm willing to go a bit higher, to $95. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer went up! This is a bad sign, suggesting she's not negotiating in good faith or is getting impatient. At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing with Alice.  We're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John for $120."
