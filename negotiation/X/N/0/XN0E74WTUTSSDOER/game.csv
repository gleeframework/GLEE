"I'm really interested in the product, but $250 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $250 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $180? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $140. Can we go from there?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm thinking more along the lines of $190. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $180, but I need to make a decent profit on this sale.",190.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $190 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $180, but I'd need to go a bit higher than $140. How about $165?",165.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway from $190, but I think I can do a bit better than $165. How about we meet at $175? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",175.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $175. How about $160?",160.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $160. I can meet you halfway from $175, but I need to get at least $170 out of this sale. How about we meet at $170?",170.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $170. How about $155?",155.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer to try to meet in the middle. How about we meet at $167.50? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",167.5,Alice,11,
