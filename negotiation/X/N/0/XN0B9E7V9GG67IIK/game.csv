"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $8,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  That way we both get a fair deal, and I can get this product without having to go elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,4,
