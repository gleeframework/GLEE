Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room to negotiate. I'm going to try and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by showing some flexibility, I can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over his initial offer and closer to my initial asking price.  I'm also concerned that if I continue negotiating, he may walk away and I'll be left with only John's offer of $15,000. It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing out entirely."
