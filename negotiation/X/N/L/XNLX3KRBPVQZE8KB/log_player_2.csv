"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's more than what the product is worth to you, and you can get it from John for a much better price.  There's no reason to accept her offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $120 at this time. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to what you're willing to pay, it's still above your maximum. You can still get the product from John for a better price, so it's not worth accepting. You'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum of $120.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, you've already gone through several rounds and it's clear that Alice is not willing to go much lower.  

Since you can get the product from John for your target price of $120, it's the best decision to buy from John now.  You save time and ensure you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
