{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price, especially as we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations. I'm hoping a slight counter-offer might be enough to get him to meet me in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.  Given we're approaching the halfway point of negotiations, I need to consider the possibility of selling to John. I'm hoping this offer is enough to get Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to move on if it doesn't."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to my minimum, I still want to try for a better price.  There are still a couple of rounds left, and selling to John for $15,000 is a decent backup.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer."
