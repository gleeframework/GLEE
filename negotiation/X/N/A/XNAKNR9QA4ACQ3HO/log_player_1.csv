"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more, while also being competitive and hopefully enticing Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $120, so I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? I'm sure you'll still find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
```

I'm offering a price that is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a price that's above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $132.50 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $130, which is right in the middle. Let's close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is slightly below my preferred price, but it's above my minimum and a good compromise. It's worth closing the deal at this point, rather than risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even a rejection,  especially since John is offering $120."
