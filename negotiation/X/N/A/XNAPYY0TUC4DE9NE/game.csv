"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from a successful transaction. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. My maximum budget remains at $9,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
