"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product holds significant value for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle on $950,000? This seems like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.  This price acknowledges the value of the product to you while ensuring I can still meet my minimum requirements.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate you coming down further, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. To meet in the middle, I'd be willing to offer $975,000. This demonstrates my seriousness about buying and offers a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,025,000. This is a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal and move forward. ",1025000.0,Alice,7,
