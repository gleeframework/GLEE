"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly below my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to recoup a larger portion of the product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product holds significant value for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle on $950,000? This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I appreciate Bob's effort to find a compromise, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my minimum value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate you coming down further, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. To meet in the middle, I'd be willing to offer $975,000. This demonstrates my seriousness about buying and offers a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to meet my needs.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need a price that reflects the value of the product for me."
