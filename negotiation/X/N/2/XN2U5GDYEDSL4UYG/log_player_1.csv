Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $150 (its value to John), aiming slightly lower increases the chance Bob accepts. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is still a significant profit margin for you (Alice) while being more enticing to Bob than your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
