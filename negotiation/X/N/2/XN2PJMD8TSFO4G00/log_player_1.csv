Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John acts as a safety net at $10,000, Alice should aim higher with Bob to potentially increase her profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $15,000 offer represents a 50% markup. While this is a significant increase, it's not so high that it would immediately deter Bob, especially if the product's value to him is clear.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price, closer to his perceived value of $10,000.

This strategy balances ambition with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
