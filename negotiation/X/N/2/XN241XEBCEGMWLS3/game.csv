"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested!",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $120. How about $125? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of $125 and $130, so how about $127.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $127.50 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $128. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not convinced that $128 is the best deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of $120 and $128, so how about $124? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",124.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $124 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $126. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",126.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not willing to go above $120. I'm willing to meet you at $120, and I'm willing to walk away if that's not acceptable to you. This is my final offer.",120.0,Bob,10,
