"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is within your budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is likely starting high, knowing you have an alternative but also wanting to maximize her profit.  You're willing to pay $150, so there's room to negotiate."
