Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly below its true worth. While I value it at $1,500,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This is a substantial discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile one. Please let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,300,000. This is a price that is:
    * Higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000, making it potentially attractive to him.
    * Lower than my minimum valuation of $1,500,000, giving me some wiggle room.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and highlights the potential savings for Bob. This approach aims to:
    * Incentivize Bob to consider the offer seriously.
    * Build a sense of urgency by implying that I am willing to sell to John if Bob declines.

**Note:** This is a strategic offer, but the optimal price depends on factors like your negotiation skills, Bob's financial situation, and your urgency to sell."
