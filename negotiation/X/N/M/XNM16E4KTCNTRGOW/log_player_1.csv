Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to secure the maximum possible profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **High starting point:** The offered price of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000).
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, leading to a final price somewhere between $1,100,000 and your minimum. 
* **Emphasizes value:** The message highlights the product's value and potential, justifying the high price and appealing to Bob's interest.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation. You are not desperate to sell at any cost.

This approach balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
