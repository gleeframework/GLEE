Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he accepts, great! If he rejects or counter-offers, it provides insight into how much he values the product.
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives Alice a safety net. This means she doesn't have to settle for anything less than her minimum price."
