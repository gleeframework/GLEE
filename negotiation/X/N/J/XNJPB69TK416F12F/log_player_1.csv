{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get to maximize my profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the potential win-win situation for both of us, making it more likely Bob will consider my offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute bottom line, giving myself flexibility to counteroffer if necessary.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While I'm negotiating with Bob, I'm also aware that I have a backup offer from John for $1,500,000. This keeps me from being overly desperate to close a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. This price aligns better with my budget while still allowing you to achieve a reasonable profit. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $1,400,000 by counteroffering.  
* **John's Offer is a Strong Backstop:**  Having John's offer of $1,500,000 provides me with the confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price gives you a great deal on the product, and allows me to make a more reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price closer to my desired range.
* **Reiterate Mutual Benefit:** I'm again emphasizing the win-win scenario for both of us, highlighting that this offer is fair for both parties.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** By not dropping to Bob's offer, I'm still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer is My Anchor:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to be firm in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet you at $1,350,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000 for your product. This price still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Bottom Line:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm still $25,000 away from my desired profit.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Further negotiation with Bob may lead to a lower price, as he's clearly unwilling to move much further. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees me a higher profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  It's in my best interest to accept John's offer and secure the sale for a guaranteed profit."
