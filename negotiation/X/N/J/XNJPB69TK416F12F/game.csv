"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get to maximize my profit.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. This price aligns better with my budget while still allowing you to achieve a reasonable profit. I look forward to your response.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price gives you a great deal on the product, and allows me to make a more reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet you at $1,350,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000 for your product. This price still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
