{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Value to Bob:**  The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so $10,000 is within his potential budget.
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects this offer, I have the option to move on to John, who is guaranteed to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum price of $12,000, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. I can try to meet him halfway or propose a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a Backup:**  If further negotiations with Bob fail, I can always fall back on John and secure a guaranteed $12,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer represents a middle ground between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:**  It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $9,500 still leaves me with a decent profit while potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still move on to John and secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price than before, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000.
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer and try to push the price closer to my target. 
* **Time to Be Firm:** I need to be more assertive to avoid settling for a price that is too low.
* **John is Always an Option:** If Bob continues to refuse, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250 as a final compromise.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer presents a firm stance while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's a small decrease from my previous offer, but enough to show some flexibility. 
* **High Stakes:** I'm getting closer to my minimum price, so I need to be more firm in my stance.
* **Emphasizing Value:** Highlighting the value of the product and framing the offer as a compromise helps reinforce my position.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  The phrase ""final compromise"" subtly pressures Bob into making a decision. 
* **Plan B Ready:** If Bob still rejects, I can confidently move on to John and secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $8,800, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer, and further negotiations seem unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially lead to a lower price or an even longer negotiation process.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which exceeds my minimum price and ensures a significant profit.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's a risk that further negotiations with Bob could fail, leading to a lower price or a wasted opportunity.  

Selling to John provides a quick and certain solution, maximizing my profit and minimizing any potential risk."
