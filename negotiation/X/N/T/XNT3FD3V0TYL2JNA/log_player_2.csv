# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently valued at $10,000 for me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested.
