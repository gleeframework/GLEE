"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer.",8500.0,Alice,1,
