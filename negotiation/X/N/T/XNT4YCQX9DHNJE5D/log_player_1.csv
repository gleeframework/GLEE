Round 6

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly anchored at $1,200,000. It's time to give him a reason to move or walk away. I'll send one more counteroffer to gauge his flexibility. If he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is not budging from his $1,200,000 offer. It's clear he's unwilling to meet above that price.  There's little point in continuing the negotiation, as I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount. It's time to move on and finalize the deal with John."
