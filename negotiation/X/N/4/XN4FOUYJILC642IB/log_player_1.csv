Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your alternatives:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which sets your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob, who values the product at $1,000,000.  
* **Aiming for a win-win:** While maximizing your profit is key, a price closer to the middle might be more appealing to Bob, making a deal more likely.

By setting this initial price, you:

1. **Signal seriousness** about selling the product but also show you're open to discussion.
2. **Maximize potential profit**  while still offering a price potentially attractive to Bob. 
 
This approach balances your goal of earning as much as possible with the understanding that a successful negotiation often involves compromise."
