Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you working with me on this. While $14,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firmly set at $14,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable.  It's time to take John's guaranteed offer."
