{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, ensuring a potential for a higher profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept it, I can still potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll try to counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000? I feel that's a competitive offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than what I'd like, but it's a good compromise.  It's closer to my initial offer, and it's significantly higher than what I'd get from John.  It's time to accept and move on."
