"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
