"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your need to get a good price, $1,025,000 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product.  This would be a win for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
