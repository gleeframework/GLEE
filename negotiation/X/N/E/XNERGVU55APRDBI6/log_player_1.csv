Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a profit and me a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
