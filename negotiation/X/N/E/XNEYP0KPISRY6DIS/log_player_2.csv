"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you for $135. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $135 is too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're aiming to get the price significantly lower, so starting with a low counter-offer makes sense. This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to try to accommodate your needs. I'm proposing to offer the product to you for $110. This is a fair compromise considering the value and quality of the product. I hope you find this offer more appealing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm happy with. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the adjusted offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $105? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our previous counteroffer. This shows we're willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're finding the product appealing, Bob. After careful consideration, I've decided to offer the product to you for $115. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget. I hope this offer meets your expectations and we can move forward with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is only budging a little. It's time to get closer to my walk-away point or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  To be honest, $110 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works for you, I'm ready to make the purchase."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counteroffer accomplishes a few things:

* **Firmness:** We're reiterating the $110 figure as our limit, signaling this is a serious offer.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning readiness to buy adds a bit of time pressure without being aggressive.
* **Politeness:**  We want to maintain a good tone even while being firm in our negotiation. 

Let's see if this convinces Alice or if it's time to move on to John."
