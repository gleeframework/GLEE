"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a price of $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it's a price I'm willing to accept to facilitate a quick sale. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my full asking price. So, I urge you to consider this offer seriously.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for $800,000 from John.
* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than your maximum budget. 
* While Alice mentions another buyer, there's no guarantee that's true, and it shouldn't influence you to overpay."
