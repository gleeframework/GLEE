"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $140 is lower than John's price of $150.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even at $140, you are paying less than the product is worth to you ($150)."
