"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While I understand your offer, $13,000 is significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This price still allows me to cover my costs and is a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
