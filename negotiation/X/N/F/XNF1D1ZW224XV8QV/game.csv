"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1350000? This price is still a good deal for you, considering your estimated value, and gives me a bit more room to negotiate.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1300000. This offers a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
