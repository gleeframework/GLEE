"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something revolutionary.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm intrigued by the product's potential, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $750000 is getting closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to go to $650000, which I believe reflects a fair value considering the potential of the product.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $725000 is getting closer to where I need to be. I'm going to offer $700000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product and our discussions.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $700000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725000, but I'm not going any lower. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",725000.0,Alice,7,
