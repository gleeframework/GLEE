Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,000 is still significantly above my minimum ($12,000) and offers a tempting discount while leaving room for Bob to potentially counter-offer.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: This phrasing adds a sense of value and urgency to the offer."
