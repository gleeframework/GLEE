{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's definitely worth more than $8,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, but my initial offer is still high enough that I can accept John's offer if Bob doesn't come close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and also below my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially reaching a compromise.
* **John is a safe option:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great price for a product worth so much to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Maintain leverage:** $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I still have room to negotiate further if necessary. 
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob to emphasize the benefits of accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still a little over my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I'm really eager to get this product, and this price would make it work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome. 
* **Potential for counteroffer:**  Rejecting allows me to counter with a slight compromise, potentially reaching a deal closer to my target.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations stall or go too low, I can always switch to John's offer for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to go down to $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is still a great deal for a product that's worth so much to you. I'm confident you won't regret this purchase."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** This counteroffer is only a $500 decrease from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but not giving away too much. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, hoping to push him to accept this final offer.
* **Setting a limit:** I'm establishing $9,500 as my final price point, signaling that further negotiation is unlikely.  
* **Safety net:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can confidently switch to John's offer without significant loss."
