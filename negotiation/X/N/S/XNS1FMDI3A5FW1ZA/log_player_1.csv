Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering $125, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with what I can get from John. There's no point in further negotiation as I'm not going to get a better deal."
