Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still above Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still staying above Bob's offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and may entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal.  I'll take the $1,750,000 and secure the sale."
