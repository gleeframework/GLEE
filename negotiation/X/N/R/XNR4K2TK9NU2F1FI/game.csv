"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $9,000 for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
