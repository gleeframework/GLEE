"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob (""great deal,"" ""useful"").
* **Open-ended question:** I'm giving Bob an opportunity to respond and potentially start a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested. I can use this to negotiate a better price in the next round. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for $100, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price. 
* **Highlight value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using ""fair price"" and ""meet halfway"" to create a sense of cooperation and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I'm getting closer to John's offer, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps my options open and prevents me from settling for a suboptimal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $75 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we settle at $85? It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller compromise:**  I'm demonstrating further flexibility by lowering my price again, but still maintaining a margin.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm staying above John's offer to encourage Bob to negotiate further."
