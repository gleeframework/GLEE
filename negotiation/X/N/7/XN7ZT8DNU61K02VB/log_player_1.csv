Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,600,000 is a bit out of my price range. Given my research and the value I see, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
