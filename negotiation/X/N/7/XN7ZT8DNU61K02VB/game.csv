"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,600,000 is a bit out of my price range. Given my research and the value I see, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1,200,000? This would be a good compromise, and we can both move forward with this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
