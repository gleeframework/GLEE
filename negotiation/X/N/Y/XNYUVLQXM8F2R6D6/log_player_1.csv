Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This price is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. It gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 

I'm using a high initial price to see how much Bob is willing to pay. If he rejects, I can lower the price gradually while still being profitable.  I also have the option of stopping the negotiation at any time and selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids any further risk of negotiation. There's no point in trying to get a higher price, as I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at the same price."
