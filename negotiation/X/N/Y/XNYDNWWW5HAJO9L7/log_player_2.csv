Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10,000. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,250. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $10,000.  She countered a ""final offer"" by going up in price. It's unlikely she'll move significantly in the last round. At this point, cutting my losses and taking the guaranteed $12,000 deal from John is the most rational choice."
