"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its potential.  This is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair profit for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. How about we settle on $1,125,000?  This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product while ensuring a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
