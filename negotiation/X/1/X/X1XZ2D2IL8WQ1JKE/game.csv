"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1700000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still within your budget.  While I'm confident I can sell it to another buyer for $1500000, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount to secure the sale. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
