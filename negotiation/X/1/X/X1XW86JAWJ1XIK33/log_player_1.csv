Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit on what I can spend. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still much higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm serious about buying this, but it needs to be within a reasonable range.  How about $700,000?

I'm willing to make another move to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap here. I can see you're motivated to sell, so let's try to find a number we can both agree on. How about $800,000? That's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his maximum willingness to pay is $800,000.  It's highly unlikely he'll go beyond that, and further negotiation is likely to waste valuable time.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is significantly higher. Accepting John's offer makes the most business sense."
