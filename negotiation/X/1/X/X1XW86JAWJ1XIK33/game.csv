"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit on what I can spend. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you considering my offer and providing your perspective. While $2,300,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still much higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm serious about buying this, but it needs to be within a reasonable range.  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I understand your position, but the $700,000 range doesn't reflect the real value this product offers.  I'm willing to make another move to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap here. I can see you're motivated to sell, so let's try to find a number we can both agree on. How about $800,000? That's my absolute limit.",800000.0,Bob,6,
