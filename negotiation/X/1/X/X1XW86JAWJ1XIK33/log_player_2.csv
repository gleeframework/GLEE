Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you considering my offer and providing your perspective. While $2,300,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered while acknowledging your interest.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I understand your position, but the $700,000 range doesn't reflect the real value this product offers.  I'm willing to make another move to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.
