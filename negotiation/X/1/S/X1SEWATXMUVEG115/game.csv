"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really hoping to stay at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you've highlighted and the fact that I'm ready to purchase today.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my initial asking price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
