"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll see its worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. It's worth considerably more based on its features and what it can do for you. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While the product has great features, $18,000 is still beyond my budget. I could consider a price closer to $12,000.  Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind. To be fair, I could go down to $16,000. That's my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a significant gap from what I can afford.  I can offer $13,000, and that's pushing my budget. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
