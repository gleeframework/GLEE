Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. It's worth considerably more based on its features and what it can do for you. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 4

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While the product has great features, $18,000 is still beyond my budget. I could consider a price closer to $12,000.  Would that work for you?"",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind. To be fair, I could go down to $16,000. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Round 6
