Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to aim higher to see if we can get closer to our maximum potential profit.
* **Credible Alternative:** Mentioning other interested buyers (John) isn't a bluff; it's a factual alternative that strengthens our negotiating position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still staying significantly above our minimum acceptable price."
