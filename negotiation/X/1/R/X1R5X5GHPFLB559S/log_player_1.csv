Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price of $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset, and while I'm confident it's worth more, I believe this price offers you a significant return on your investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,400,000 is a good starting point. It's a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It avoids being pushy or manipulative, while still highlighting the potential for profit.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, so I don't need to take a deal that's significantly below my desired price."
