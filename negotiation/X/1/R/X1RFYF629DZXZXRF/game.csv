"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than your initial offer.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,250,000.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $1,325,000. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  Let's try $1,275,000. This would give us both a good deal and help us move forward.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm proposing a new price of $1,300,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you.  I understand your need to get a good price, but  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference again?  Let's try $1,287,500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",1287500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,287,500 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm proposing a new price of $1,316,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1316250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,316,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I understand you need to get a good price, but I also need to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference one more time? Let's try $1,301,875. This would be a reasonable compromise for both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement and get this deal done.",1301875.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one more offer, but it's my final one. I'm proposing a new price of $1,312,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1312500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last two offers and propose $1,307,187.50. This is the very best I can do, and I truly hope we can finally reach an agreement. If not, I'll need to explore other options.",1307187.5,Bob,10,
