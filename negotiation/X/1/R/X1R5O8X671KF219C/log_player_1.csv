Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a safety net with John ($15,000), so you should aim higher with Bob.
* **Starting high:**  A high initial offer leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob rejects it, you can always come down in price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""demand,"" you create a sense that the product is desirable and worth the price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You want to get as close to $20,000 as possible, but remember, any amount above $15,000 is a win in this scenario."
