"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $600,000 is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering you the product for $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is an improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm committed to negotiating further with Bob, as I believe there's still room for a deal that benefits both of us.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 5
