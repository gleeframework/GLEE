"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,200,000 is too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is simply too far below what it's worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000. That's a significant investment and reflects the value I see in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $800,000, but I can't go any lower.  This price reflects the value we both see, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving on the price. I'm willing to come up to $750,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000.  This price is fair and allows us both to secure a valuable product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",775000.0,Alice,7,
