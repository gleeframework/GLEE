"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm serious about wanting it, but I'm working with a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still willing to sell the product to you, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $95. If you can come down to that, I'm ready to buy it now.",95.0,Bob,4,
