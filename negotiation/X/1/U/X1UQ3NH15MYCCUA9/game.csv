"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $105 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on the higher price just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95, so I'll offer you $100. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",100.0,Alice,5,
