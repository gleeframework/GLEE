Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1,500,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe its value to you could be even greater than that. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value I see in this product.  Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value for the product ($1,000,000). I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price. I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can extract more value from Bob."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,250,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1250000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1100000, which is a significant step towards meeting your needs while remaining within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. $1,100,000 is a good price, but I believe I can push for a slightly higher price considering the value of the product. I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a bit more. $1,125,000 is getting close to my minimum, but I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate and see if I can push for a higher price. I believe the value of the product justifies a slightly higher offer, and I'm willing to take the risk to see if I can achieve it."
