Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. Remember, you can always drop the price a bit later, but starting high allows you to potentially make a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price is still fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm prepared to walk away if it's not acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer allows you to secure a sale at the price you were willing to settle for. While it's tempting to try and push for more, there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal, and you risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
