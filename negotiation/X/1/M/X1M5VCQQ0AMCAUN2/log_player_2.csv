"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,350,000 is significantly more than the product is worth to you ($1,500,000).
* **Negotiation potential:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer with a lower price in the next round."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.
