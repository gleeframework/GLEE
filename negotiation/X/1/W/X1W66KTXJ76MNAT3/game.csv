"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $750,000, which is a $100,000 discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle on $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",760000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are getting closer!  I'm willing to come up a bit to $740,000. That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",740000.0,Bob,6,
