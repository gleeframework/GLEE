"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in this product but I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $127. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",127.0,Alice,5,
