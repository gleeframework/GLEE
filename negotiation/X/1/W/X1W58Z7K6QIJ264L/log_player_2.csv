"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Considering its value, I'm offering it at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer of $10,250 is within Bob's budget of $12,000.** This is a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $1,750 compared to buying from John.
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk.** Alice might reject further counteroffers, and time is running out.  There's also a risk of getting stuck at a price closer to $12,000.

It's better to secure the deal at a price that's still beneficial and within Bob's budget."
