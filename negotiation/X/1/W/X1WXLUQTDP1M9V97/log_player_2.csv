{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a competitive offer. Considering the value of the product and our costs, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $13,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price possible. While $13,500 is a better offer than the initial $14,000, there's still a chance to get closer to Bob's desired price of $12,500.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $13,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
