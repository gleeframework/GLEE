"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a better price than $120, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer allows for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105. Would you be willing to come down to that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, but he also wants to avoid being too aggressive early on. Offering $105 is a reasonable counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $107.50 is a good price, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. He's already made a counteroffer and there are still several rounds left.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  I'm still hoping to get it for $105.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his target price of $105, but he's acknowledging Alice's compromise. By reiterating his previous offer, he's hoping to demonstrate his seriousness while staying firm on his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your offer, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $106. It's a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and the offer is now only $1 above his target.  With several rounds left,  it's unlikely that Bob will be able to get the price down further. Accepting the offer ensures he gets a good deal without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the product to John."
