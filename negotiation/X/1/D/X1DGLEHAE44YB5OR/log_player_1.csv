"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to sell it for $9,000, which is a good compromise.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $9,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $8,250, which is closer to what I'm comfortable with. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,625?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,625. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm running out of time. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from him, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. I'll sell to John for $8,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
