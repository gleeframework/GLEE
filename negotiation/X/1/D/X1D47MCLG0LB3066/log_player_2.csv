# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
