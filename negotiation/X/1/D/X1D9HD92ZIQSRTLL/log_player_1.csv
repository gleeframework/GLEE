"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.  It also acknowledges the value the product holds for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below Alice's desired minimum of $8,000.  Alice has a good chance of getting a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, which provides plenty of time to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's ideal would be higher, $9,500 is a solid deal. It surpasses her minimum of $8,000 and is a good compromise, considering Bob has shown a willingness to pay a premium.  With 6 rounds left, there is still a chance that Bob might come up higher, but accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of a lower price later."
