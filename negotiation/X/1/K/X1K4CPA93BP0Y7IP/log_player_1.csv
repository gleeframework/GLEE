Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. Can you consider that?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $19,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $18,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $19,000, Bob has consistently moved upwards in his offers. At $18,500, we're getting into a range where the additional profit I might squeeze out isn't worth the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of having to settle for John's offer."
