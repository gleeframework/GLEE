{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,150,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price of $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still netting you a significant profit above his perceived value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $1,150,000, you present a price that's closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) while still being attractive enough to potentially entice Bob."
