"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer of $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John offers. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""That's a bit too high for me.  I'm interested, but could you do it for $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counter-offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still too high. You should counter-offer again, moving closer to your maximum budget but leaving room for a final compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me. How about $110? That's a fair price."",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate by moving closer to her price.
* **Close to your limit:**  $110 is still within your budget and leaves you some room to go up slightly if needed.
* **Confident tone:**  Phrasing like ""a fair price"" can encourage Alice to accept without seeming aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you like the product, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we try $145, and we can call it a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling:** Alice went up in price from $140 to $145. This suggests she's not genuinely negotiating and may be trying to get you to overpay. 
* **John's the safer bet:** You have a guaranteed offer for $120 from John. There's no point risking going over your budget with Alice."
