"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, as it reflects the true value of the product to both of us. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to pay the full asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice is offering a ""fair"" price, it's still the maximum you're willing to pay. John is offering the same price, so you have no reason to accept Alice's offer. You'll get the product for the same price from John."
