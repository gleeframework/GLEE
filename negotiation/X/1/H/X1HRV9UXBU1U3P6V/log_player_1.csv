"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and fairness of the deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price, signaling flexibility.

This strategy aims to establish a strong starting point while leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation room:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does indicate that he's willing to negotiate.
* **Exploring options:** I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a mutually beneficial price. 

I believe there's still potential to reach a deal with Bob that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1,400,000 for the product. This price reflects its value while also allowing us to reach a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to my minimum while still being within a reasonable negotiating range for Bob.
* **Compromise:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise to show flexibility and encourage a deal.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm reframing the offer as a way to find common ground and achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, it's not enough.
* **Negotiation space:** I have five rounds remaining, so there's still time to negotiate further and potentially reach a deal closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can still sell to John for my minimum price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and try to get a higher price. I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum, but I'm also not rushing into a deal that's significantly below my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To make this work, I'd need to see $1,350,000. This is a small increase from your last offer, and I believe it reflects the unique value of this product. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** I'm only asking for a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet him halfway. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to justify the price point.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm reframing the negotiation as a way to find a solution that works for both of us, encouraging cooperation.

This strategy aims to further bridge the gap while staying firm on my desired price point. With only five rounds left, I need to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and potentially losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  This is a small increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited time:** While we are getting closer to a deal, with only four rounds left, time is running out.
* **John's offer is a guarantee:**  I can still sell to John for my minimum price, which is a safer option than risking a deal with Bob that falls short.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now, but I'm still open to negotiation. However, with limited time and a reliable alternative in John, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's below my minimum. I need to see a more significant move from Bob in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. To be honest, I'm surprised we haven't reached an agreement yet, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $1,337,500. This is a fair compromise, and it demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work. I hope we can finally come to an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1337500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my last offer and Bob's, showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Sense of urgency:** I'm subtly emphasizing the fact that time is running out to reach a deal.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm reframing the offer as a fair compromise, hoping to encourage Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial solution.

I'm pushing for a price closer to my minimum while still being flexible. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and the time constraints, leading to a successful deal. If not, I have the option to sell to John."
