"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is well above your maximum budget. It's a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1,400,000 for the product. This price reflects its value while also allowing us to reach a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your target.  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and try to get a price closer to your desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To make this work, I'd need to see $1,350,000. This is a small increase from your last offer, and I believe it reflects the unique value of this product. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your budget with each offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high.  Since you've only had 5 rounds and have 5 remaining, it's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a better price. There's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  This is a small increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. To be honest, I'm surprised we haven't reached an agreement yet, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $1,337,500. This is a fair compromise, and it demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work. I hope we can finally come to an agreement in this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal $1,000,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of negotiating a lower price are diminishing.  It's becoming clear that reaching a mutually agreeable price within your budget might be difficult.  Since you have a guaranteed option to purchase from John for your desired price, it's more prudent to choose that option rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
