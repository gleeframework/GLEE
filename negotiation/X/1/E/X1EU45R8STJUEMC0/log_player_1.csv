"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,075,000 is a good price and it's likely we won't get much closer. I'd rather secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for less."
