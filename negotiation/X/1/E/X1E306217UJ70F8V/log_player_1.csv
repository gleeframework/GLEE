Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close as possible to Bob's $15,000 valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could scare him off. 

This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
