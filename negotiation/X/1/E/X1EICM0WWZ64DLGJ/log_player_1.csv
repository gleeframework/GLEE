Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it by mentioning ""its value."" This subtly implies he'd be getting a good deal even at the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") rather than demanding, signaling willingness to discuss.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive or dislikes haggling, a slightly lower initial offer might be better. 
* **Market Demand:** If the product is in high demand, you might be able to push for an even higher price. 
 
This offer aims to maximize profit while keeping the door open for Bob to accept."
