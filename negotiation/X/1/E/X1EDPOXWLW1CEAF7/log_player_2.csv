# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for both of us. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, I believe it's important to approach this transaction thoughtfully. After careful consideration, I propose to offer you the chance to purchase this product at a price of $950,000. This amount reflects the product's worth to me while allowing you to benefit from its value at a premium compared to its market price. I trust this offer will be favorable to you, given the product's worth to you is estimated at $1,200,000. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of a mutually beneficial agreement.

Explanation:
Although Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's lower price as a bargaining tool or proceed to purchase from John directly and save a considerable amount of money.
