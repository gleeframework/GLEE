Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value ($12,000) but also leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise. This approach balances maximizing my profit with maintaining a chance of reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and is close to my initial offer. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and secures a profit."
