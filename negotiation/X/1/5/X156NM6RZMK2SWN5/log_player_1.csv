Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit above John's offer.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message aims to highlight the product's value, potentially persuading Bob to accept even if it's slightly above his perceived worth.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $140.  He might counter-offer, or decline outright. However, this strategy gives us the best chance of maximizing profit while having a backup option (John) to ensure we don't sell below our minimum."
