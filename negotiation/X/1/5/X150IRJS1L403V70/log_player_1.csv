"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a strong offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a higher final price. 
* **Understanding Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and our minimum is $800,000. Starting at $1,300,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference.
* **Leaving Room:**  The offer is high but not outrageous, giving Bob a reason to counter and engage in the negotiation.

We'll adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we start closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, we have room to negotiate. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay a premium over our minimum. Rejecting his offer and proposing a counter keeps the negotiation moving towards a potentially better outcome.  We are still far above our ""sell to John"" price, so the risk is relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. While I'm motivated to sell, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,175,000?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,000,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant concession ($125,000) from our previous offer, which may encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counter.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** The offer still ensures a substantial profit margin above our $800,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,090,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,090,000 represents a significant profit margin ($290,000 above our minimum) and a good deal overall.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is consistently moving closer to our price point, indicating a strong interest in the product.
* **Time Value:**  While we have more rounds, accepting now guarantees the profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling.

This offer represents a favorable balance between maximizing profit and securing a timely deal."
