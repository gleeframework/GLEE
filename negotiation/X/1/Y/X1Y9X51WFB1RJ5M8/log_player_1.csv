"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident in the product's value to him, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,300,000. This is still a good profit margin for me and closer to Bob's initial offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price point."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase it further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm reducing my offer again to $1,250,000. This is now only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating my commitment to reach a deal. I hope this will encourage Bob to close the deal."

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to get more, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept his offer."
