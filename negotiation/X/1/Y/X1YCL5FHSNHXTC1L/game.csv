"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to be closer to $600,000 for it to make sense for me.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding that there's a gap between our valuations.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial ask. How about we consider $1,200,000?  I believe this reflects the true worth of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price.  I appreciate the movement. However, I need to be realistic about my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us.  To demonstrate my willingness to find a compromise, I'd be willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
