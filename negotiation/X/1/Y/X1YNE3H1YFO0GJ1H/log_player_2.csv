"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's offer, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in your product. However, $9,500 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident the product's value to you justifies a slightly higher price. How about $9000? This would still represent a significant savings for you compared to its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's target price, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for a potential lower price. Bob still has a few rounds to try and get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,750? This would give you a fair profit, and save me some money.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
