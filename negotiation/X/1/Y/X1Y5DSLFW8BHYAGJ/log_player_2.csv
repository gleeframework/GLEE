# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to start by trying to negotiate a lower price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. I'm still a bit high.  How about $1,050,000? That's a good middle ground, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll counteroffer at $1080000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down a bit, but we're still not at a price that's a good deal for us. We'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $1,080,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go to $1,060,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this is a good deal for you, too."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'll meet you halfway between $1060000 and $1080000, which is $1070000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to stand by it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and we're close to our target price. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk of Alice walking away. Accepting her offer ensures we get the product for a good price and avoid potentially losing the deal entirely."
