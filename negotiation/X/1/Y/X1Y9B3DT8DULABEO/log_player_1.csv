Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value you've outlined, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This would allow us both to secure a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $925,000 is still out of my range. Let's split the difference and settle on $875,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate. Bob is moving closer to our desired price point."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  How about we settle on $880,000? This is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is consistently moving upwards, and we're now at a price point well above John's offer. Accepting at $880,000 secures a significant profit. It's always possible to push for more, but there's also the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
