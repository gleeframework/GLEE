"Hello Alice! Thanks for presenting this product to me.  While it seems interesting, $150 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $100? It's a great compromise and still a good deal for you!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $100 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $90? It's a good compromise and still a good deal for you!",90.0,Alice,5,
