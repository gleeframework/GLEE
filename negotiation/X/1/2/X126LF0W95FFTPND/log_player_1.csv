"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed.  It's important to remember I have a safety net of $8,000 with John, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is close to my minimum, but I think I can get a bit more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible but still want to get a price closer to my desired value. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can do better. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, but I'm getting close.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,600. This is a smaller compromise than before, as I want to show Bob that I'm firm on my price. I'm hoping that he'll realize that this is a fair price and finally accept the offer. If he rejects again, I'm probably going to go with John's offer, as I'm running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. I've had a few rounds with Bob, and it seems like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm down to only 4 rounds left, so I don't want to risk it.  John's offer of $8,000 is my safety net, and it's time to take it."
