"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, and you have the safety net of John's offer if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject your offer again, or she may not be willing to go lower.  At $850,000, you're getting a significant discount compared to John's offer, and the potential further savings might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
