"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and my need to make a decent profit.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,125,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm happy to go to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This gives you a good return and allows us to close this deal.  Let's try to find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but I'm still a little too far away from where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm ready to pay $1,080,000. This price is a fair reflection of the value to me, and it allows us to finally close this deal.  Let's reach a final agreement and move forward!",1080000.0,Bob,8,
