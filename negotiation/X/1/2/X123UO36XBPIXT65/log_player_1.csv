Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and potential benefit the product has for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate. 

By offering a price that's attractive to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation, I'm maximizing my chances of getting a good deal while also staying open to a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I want to get for the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer. I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John for $12,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your perspective. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference at $9,750?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is reasonable:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by raising my offer slightly.  
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and value for both parties.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message indicates I'm still open to negotiation but have established a clear lower limit. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. I am willing to pay $9,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $400 below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will walk away entirely, or that I'll get stuck with a price closer to his initial $9,500.
* **Time is money:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, I'm not sure it's worth the risk or the time investment to continue negotiating.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. While it's not ideal, it's a solid outcome given the circumstances."
