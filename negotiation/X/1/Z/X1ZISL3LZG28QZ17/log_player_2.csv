"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth $10000 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for less than it's worth to you, and I get a sale without having to go through the hassle of finding another buyer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob values the product at $10,000.
* Alice's offer is $12,000.
* Bob can get the product from John for $10,000.

Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves Bob $2,000."
