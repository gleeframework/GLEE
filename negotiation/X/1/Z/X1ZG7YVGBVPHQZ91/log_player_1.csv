Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 13500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've decided to sell to John for $15,000. Bob seems unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer, which is too low for me. I'd rather take the sure thing with John and get a price that's closer to my desired value."
