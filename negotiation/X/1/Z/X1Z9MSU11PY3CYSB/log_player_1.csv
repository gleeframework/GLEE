Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to let it go for $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Value Justification:** While vague, hinting at the product's worth and your willingness to offer it to Bob first subtly justifies the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  Even if Bob rejects the $19,000, Alice is still guaranteed her minimum price from John.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on the guaranteed sale."
