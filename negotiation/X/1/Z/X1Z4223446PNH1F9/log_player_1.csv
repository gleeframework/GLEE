Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.  I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum just yet. I'm going to counteroffer and try to squeeze out a bit more profit.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a comfortable profit margin. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the highest price I hoped for, it's still a good profit margin, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  The time is getting short, and I'm not sure I can squeeze out much more with additional counteroffers.  It's better to secure this sale than to risk a lower price with John."
