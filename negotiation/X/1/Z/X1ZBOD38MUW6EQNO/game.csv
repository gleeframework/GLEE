"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $95 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $100? This would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. I'm still willing to make a compromise, though. I'll offer it to you for $108. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
