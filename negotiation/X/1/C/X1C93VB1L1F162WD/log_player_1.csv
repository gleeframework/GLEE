Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell the product for less than $1,500,000.  I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, while giving you a good price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but we're getting closer. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,220,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but I'm starting to feel the pressure and might consider selling to John in the next round if we don't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000, but this is my final offer. If you don't accept, I might have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1280000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're feeling like we're not getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,240,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting increasingly closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, with only two rounds left and the pressure mounting, I believe the time is right to move on. I can't risk further negotiations and potentially lose out on a guaranteed sale to John. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  It's a much safer and more profitable outcome than continuing with Bob."
