"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go slightly higher than my previous offer, but I need to be at $11,000 to make it worth my while. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and land at $10,250? That's my final offer.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,250 and $11,000, which is $10,625. It's a fair price, and I think it's worth considering.",10625.0,Alice,7,
