(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We're in the final round. If I reject, I risk running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Small negotiation room:** Alice's offer is still above my budget, and there's likely not enough time to get her down to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Safety net:**  Buying from John guarantees a price I'm happy with, and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations with Alice. 

While it would be ideal to close the deal with Alice at a lower price,  the risk of not getting a deal with Alice and having to pay more to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price from Alice."
