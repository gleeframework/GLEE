"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good deal, it's still above your target of $100. There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to get a better price.  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. It shows you're serious about buying the product but also want to negotiate a price closer to your maximum limit.  You're leaving some room for Alice to counter, while still ensuring a potential profit for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price. While $90 is still slightly above your ideal, it's within a reasonable range and offers a potential savings of $10 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures the product within your budget."
