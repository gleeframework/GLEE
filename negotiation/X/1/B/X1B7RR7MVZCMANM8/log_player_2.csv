"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable asset at a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to her ($10,000 offer vs. $8,000 value). This suggests there might be room for negotiation.
* **Your Maximum:** You're willing to pay $12,000, but saving money is the goal.
* **John's Price:** John acts as a price ceiling. You know you can get the product for $12,000, so there's no need to immediately accept $10,000.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price, closer to her $8,000 value. If she doesn't budge much, you can always fall back on buying from John."
