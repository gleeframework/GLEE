"I appreciate the offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This reflects my willingness to reach an agreement, but I also need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll see it as a fair offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that we're very close to an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000, which is just a small step away from your offer.  This reflects my commitment to closing this deal, but I still need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
