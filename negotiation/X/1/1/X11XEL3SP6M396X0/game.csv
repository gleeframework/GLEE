"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This is my final concession, what do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I've already made two concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're getting too close to the bottom line. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm going to meet you at $985000. This is my last offer, so I hope you can see the value in the product at this price. What do you say?",985000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to reconsider my options and possibly buy the product from John for $800000.",980000.0,Bob,10,
