"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. My initial offer is $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to negotiating further, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. It's a fair price that's closer to my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  However,  $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10,200.  It's a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500 again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,8,
