"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it gets me closer to my target price. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is more reasonable. Let me know what you think!",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,200? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get even closer to a deal. My new counteroffer is $11,900. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",11900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. This is my final offer: $12,000. It's my bottom line, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you don't accept, I'll have to go with John's offer.",12000.0,Alice,7,
