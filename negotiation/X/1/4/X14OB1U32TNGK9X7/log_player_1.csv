{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is below Bob's maximum value but still above your minimum value. This sets a good starting point for negotiation. It also gives a reason for the offer which makes it seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to my budget as possible. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,000 is my absolute minimum.  This still gives you a good price, and it's fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000. How about we try $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,750 is above my minimum value of $12,000, so it's a good deal for me. While I could potentially try to negotiate a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob would accept a counteroffer, and it's possible I could end up selling to John for less. Accepting this offer is the most financially sound decision."
