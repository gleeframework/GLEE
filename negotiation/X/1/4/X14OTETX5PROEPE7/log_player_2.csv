"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $8000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm willing to go lower than my minimum price to work with you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
