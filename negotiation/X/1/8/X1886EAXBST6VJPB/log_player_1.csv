Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm willing to make this offer as a gesture of goodwill. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $11,000 is a price point that:
    * Offers a potential $3,000 profit for you (above your minimum).
    * Presents Bob with a $3,000 potential ""savings"" compared to its value to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The friendly tone of the message suggests you might be open to a counter-offer from Bob, potentially increasing your profit even further. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have time for a potential negotiation with Bob. If a quick sale is crucial, a higher initial offer closer to $12,000 might be more appropriate."
