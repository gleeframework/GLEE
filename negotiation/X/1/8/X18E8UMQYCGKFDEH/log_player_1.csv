"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a significant price point that allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I get a substantial profit. I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive, given the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a better price than John's, I can still potentially get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still significantly better than Bob's offer. I believe this price point is fair and will entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting increasingly lower.  While I'm not entirely happy with the price, it's getting closer to John's offer. I don't want to risk losing any more time or having the negotiation stall.  I'll sell to John for $10,000."
