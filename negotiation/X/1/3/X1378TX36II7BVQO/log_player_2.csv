"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can likely get a better price than $120.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's original price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to remember that you're aiming for a price that is beneficial to you, but also something Alice might be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While you can still try to negotiate further, Alice has come down to $130.  At this point, it's worth accepting. You're getting the product for $130, which is still below your maximum of $150."
