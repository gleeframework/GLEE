Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth to someone in your position, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially still settle above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price without explicitly revealing his maximum valuation. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
