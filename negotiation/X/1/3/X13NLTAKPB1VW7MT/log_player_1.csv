Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $110 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.  If Bob tries to negotiate down, you have some buffer before reaching your minimum acceptable price."
