"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $110.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $120.

Since Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay and lower than John's price, it's the best option. Accepting her offer allows you to save $10 compared to buying from John."
