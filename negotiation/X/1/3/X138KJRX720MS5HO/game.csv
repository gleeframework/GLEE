"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's find a middle ground and make this work.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I can't go as low as $11,250, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and we're getting closer to a deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
