Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This is a starting point that aims to maximize profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  
* **Why not a higher price?**  A higher price risks Bob rejecting the offer, leaving you with only John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Why not a lower price?**  A lower price means potentially leaving money on the table if Bob is willing to pay more. 

This strategy balances the risk of rejection with the potential for a higher sale price."
