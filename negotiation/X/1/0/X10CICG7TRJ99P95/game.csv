"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, the price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the substantial benefits you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite a ways apart on price.  I appreciate you moving down, but I need to see a more significant change to make this work. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let me know if that's something you can consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable number. To be candid, selling for anything under $1,500,000 would be a significant sacrifice for me. However, I value your interest and want to see if we can find a solution.  Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000? This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the significant movement on price. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be frank,  $1,400,000 is still pushing my budget. I can go up to $1,100,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. ",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand we both want to find a solution here.  However, $1,100,000 remains below the lowest possible price I can justify for this product. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who is prepared to offer $1,500,000. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions.  If you're able to come closer to $1,300,000, I'm confident we can make a deal. Otherwise, I may need to explore the alternative option.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand the position you're in. While the other offer is tempting for you, I'm confident I'm the right fit for this product. I'm willing to stretch to $1,150,000. This is my final offer â€“ I believe it's a win-win and avoids any further time pressure from your other potential buyer.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
