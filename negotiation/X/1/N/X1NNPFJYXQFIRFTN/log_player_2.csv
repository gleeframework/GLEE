# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're so close!  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 still doesn't cover my costs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,037,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my budget. With only a few rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate further.  The offer from John is a guaranteed price within my budget, so I'll take it and avoid further negotiation."
