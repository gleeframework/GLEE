Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential return will make it worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value but allows room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

This offer is a strategic starting point. By offering a price higher than my minimum, I leave room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory price for me. This provides me with leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  I believe there is room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I am committed to a higher price. This will force Bob to potentially come up with a counteroffer closer to my minimum or risk losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business, $1,200,000 is still below what I can accept for this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to show you my commitment to making this deal work.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,350,000:** This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes finding common ground. It reinforces that I am open to a deal but not willing to settle for a price too far below my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between firmness and flexibility. By offering a price closer to Bob's offer, I show that I am willing to negotiate. However, I also set a clear limit that is still above my minimum, demonstrating that I am serious about getting a fair price. This strategy should encourage Bob to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is still slightly below my ideal price, it is very close to my minimum desired value of $1,000,000 and offers a significant profit.  Given the risk of Bob rejecting further counteroffers, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid potentially losing the deal altogether.

**Strategy:**

This decision reflects a calculated risk assessment. While continuing to negotiate might potentially yield a slightly higher price, it also carries the risk of reaching a stalemate or Bob walking away.  Accepting the offer ensures a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
