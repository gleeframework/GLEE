"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to potentially get close to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling but still want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping I can get Bob to agree to a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping the price again to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if Bob isn't ready to accept yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, Bob's offers are getting too low. I'm not confident I can get him to come up to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing too much time. I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
