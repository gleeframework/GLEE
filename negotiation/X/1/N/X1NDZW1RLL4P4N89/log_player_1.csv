Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9,800 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his current offer. Accepting his offer would leave me with less profit than John is offering. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
