"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000, which is a significant amount.  I believe this is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your last offer and still within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $875000 is sufficient for this exceptional product. I'm willing to consider $887500. This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
