"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($600,000 vs. $800,000).  While it's a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it, which is still a significant discount from its worth to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay closer to the product's true value, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $725,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than the product's worth to him ($800,000) and only $75,000 more than his last counteroffer.  There's a good chance he won't be able to get a better price, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $800,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
