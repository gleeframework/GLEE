,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer you $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the price I could get it from another seller.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects its value to both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
