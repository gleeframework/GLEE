"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a better chance of reaching a price closer to your ideal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while explaining that it's outside the budget. This keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."

# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
