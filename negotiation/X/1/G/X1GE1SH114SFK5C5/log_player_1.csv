Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $149 allows a small buffer for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy prioritizes getting the highest price from Bob while still having a safety net with John."
