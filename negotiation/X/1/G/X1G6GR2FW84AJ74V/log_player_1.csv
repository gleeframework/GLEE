"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get as much as possible from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $10,000. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my desired price and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for $10,000. I'm not sure how much more Bob is willing to go, but I have a few rounds left to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still a bit higher than what he's offering.  I'm hoping to close the deal quickly without having to go back and forth too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'm better off selling to John and securing the full value."
