"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $11,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  To be frank, $11,000 is a little too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, but that's my final offer.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $11,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $11,200, which would be $11,100. Can we meet at that price?",11100.0,Bob,6,
