{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and you'll be getting a lot of value for your money! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get for his money, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and respond strategically.
* If negotiations stall, I have the option to sell to John for $150, guaranteeing my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I really like the product, but I'm on a bit of a tight budget. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Selling at this price would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, he's expressed interest in the product and is willing to negotiate.  
* **Counter Offer Strategy:** I can likely secure a better price by making a counteroffer.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm still emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $115 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've reached a successful compromise.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider his next counteroffer and determine whether it's worth pursuing further negotiations.
* If negotiations stall or lead to an unacceptable offer, I can still sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $110 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Loss:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, further negotiation could risk losing the sale entirely.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to sell the product quickly and avoid further rounds of negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. While I'm not getting my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to avoid potential losses and move on to other opportunities."
