Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my target. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1300000. How about we meet at $1350000? This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value and the time we've already discussed it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $1,350,000 is closer to my ideal price point of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.
* **Time is a factor:**  We've been negotiating, and continuing could risk losing the product to John.  
* **Potential value:** I believe the product might be worth more than $1,350,000, but I'm not willing to risk getting nothing by holding out for a lower price."
