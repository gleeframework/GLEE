"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but $900,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
