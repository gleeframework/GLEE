"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $140.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, so it's worth seeing if she'll negotiate."
