Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still getting a good profit margin.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants, but he's still getting a great deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counter-offers, you have space to adjust your price without going below your minimum. 

Remember, the goal is to get the highest price possible while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,350,000.  This is still a good price for you, and it's the most I can afford at the moment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

While $1,350,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,350,000 is a good price, it's just a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,400,000?  That way, we both walk away happy with the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
