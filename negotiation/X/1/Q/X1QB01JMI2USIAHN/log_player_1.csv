Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me. I'm willing to go lower if necessary, but I'll also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers aren't acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I'll reject his counteroffer and send a new one closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a profit. This offer is closer to Bob's perceived value and may be more tempting for him to accept."
