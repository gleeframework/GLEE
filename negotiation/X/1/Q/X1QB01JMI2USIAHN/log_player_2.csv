"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $10,500, which is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than John's price, showing that Bob is willing to negotiate but also wants to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $11,000, which is only $500 lower than her initial offer.  It's getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than what John is offering. At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal compared to the certainty of getting the product from John for $10,000. Bob chooses to secure the product at the lowest price possible by buying it from John."
