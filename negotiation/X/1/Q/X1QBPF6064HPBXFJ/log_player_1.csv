"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,750,000, you establish a high anchor point in Bob's mind. Even if this initial offer is rejected, it can influence his counteroffer to be closer to your desired range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The large difference between the starting price and your minimum ($1,200,000) gives you ample room to make concessions throughout the negotiation process.

It's crucial to remember that we have the backup offer from John for $1,200,000. This safety net allows us to be more assertive in our negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. 

By rejecting and proceeding to the next round, we can:

* **Signal our position:** Show Bob that we're serious about the product's value and not willing to settle for such a low price.
* **Engage in further negotiation:** Aim to reach a mutually beneficial agreement closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** While we're rejecting Bob's low offer, we're also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by significantly reducing our initial asking price.
* **Justify the Price:** By mentioning ""market value,"" we reinforce the idea that our price isn't arbitrary and is based on objective factors.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Psychology:** This phrasing, although not a literal middle ground, can be a persuasive tactic to encourage agreement. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still leaves us room to negotiate further while staying above our absolute minimum of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. I could consider going up to $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is slowly increasing, but $950,000 is still substantially below our $1,200,000 minimum and not a significant movement from his previous offer. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if we can't reach a more agreeable price. We're getting closer to the point where accepting John's offer might make more sense than continuing a potentially fruitless negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but the gap between our positions is still too wide. I'm willing to make one more significant move: $1,250,000. This is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer significantly reduces our price, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate. However, it firmly establishes our bottom line at $1,250,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By presenting it as a ""final offer"" and mentioning ""other options"" (John's offer), we introduce a sense of urgency and the possibility of walking away.
* **Limited Concessions:**  We've made several concessions. This counteroffer signals that significant movement from Bob is now required for the deal to continue. 
* **Slightly Above Minimum:** The $1,250,000 allows for a small buffer above our absolute minimum, but makes it clear that we're serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer -  I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has stated that $1,000,000 is his final offer. This indicates he's unlikely to move significantly higher.
* **Below Minimum:** Even though Bob has reached his perceived value of the product, his offer is still $200,000 below our absolute minimum.
* **Limited Potential for Further Negotiation:** While we could counter, the likelihood of Bob agreeing to a price that meets our needs is low.  
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

Continuing negotiations with Bob at this point carries a higher risk of wasted time and a potential loss compared to the certainty of selling to John."
