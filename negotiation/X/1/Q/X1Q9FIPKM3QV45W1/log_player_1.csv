While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000 right now, and I think I can convince Bob to come closer to that price."

I'm starting to feel the pressure. Time is running out, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing out completely.  John's offer is a safe and reliable option that guarantees my minimum desired price."
