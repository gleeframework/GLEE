Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** At $900,000, Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line.  While we might be able to push her a little further, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of her walking away. Accepting now secures a significant discount from both Alice's starting price and John's offer."
