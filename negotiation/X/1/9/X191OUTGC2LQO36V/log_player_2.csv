"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties to collaborate. We are offering the product at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $950,000 is significantly above Alice's estimated value of $800,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely secure a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $1,000,000 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product,  $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After reviewing your offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $900,000. We believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** $900,000 is still significantly above Alice's estimated value of $800,000, and close to Bob's maximum budget.
* **More room for negotiation:**  There's still some room to negotiate and potentially find a price closer to $850,000.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** John's offer provides a fallback option in case negotiations fail."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle at $875,000. This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. We've considered your latest offer and would like to counter with $890,000. We hope this aligns better with your expectations while ensuring a reasonable profit for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer:** $890,000 is significantly closer to Bob's counteroffer of $875,000, and  within Bob's budget. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to Alice rejecting further counteroffers, increasing the risk of reaching the 10-round limit or having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is of the essence:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer ensures a deal is made and secures the product. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer at $890,000 is the most strategic decision in this round. It provides a good deal for Bob while minimizing risk and ensuring a successful purchase within the time constraint."
