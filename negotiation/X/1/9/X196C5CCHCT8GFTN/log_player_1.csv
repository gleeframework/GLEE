Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. It gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also reflects the value I place on the product. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his offer and how determined I am to sell to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell. I want to see if there's any room for a compromise. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  This is a reasonable compromise - it's more than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to get a better price than he initially offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go lower, and John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price. I'm going to sell to John."
