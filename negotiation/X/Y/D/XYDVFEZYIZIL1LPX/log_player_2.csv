"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is far too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, and it's only worth $120 to Alice. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiating often involves starting with an offer lower than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and gives you an idea of Alice's flexibility.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $80, I'm trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to my desired price range.  Even if Alice doesn't accept this offer, it sets a lower reference point for future counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  I'm willing to pay up to $100, so this offer leaves space for negotiation. I anticipate Alice countering with a price between $80 and $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand it's valuable to you, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to my price range, $130 is still above my $100 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's counteroffer suggests she's willing to negotiate. There's a chance to bring the price down further.
* **John's Offer:** It's good to keep John's $100 offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's the absolute most I can do."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:**  I'm now offering my maximum budget. This is a firm but fair offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying it's ""the absolute most I can do,"" I'm signaling that this is my final offer, prompting Alice to make a decision. 
* **Potential for Agreement:** Alice knows the product is worth $120 to her, and my offer provides a $20 profit. There's a good chance she'll accept."
