"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to get a better return on investment.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, $950,000 undervalues the potential this product holds.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects its true worth while still offering you significant ROI potential.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being more in line with my financial constraints.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,037,500. This price reflects the product's value and offers you a strong potential return.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $1,037,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm counteroffering $1,025,000 again, as I believe this is the maximum I can afford. I hope we can meet at this price.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
