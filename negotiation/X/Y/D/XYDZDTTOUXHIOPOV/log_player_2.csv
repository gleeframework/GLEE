Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth around $12,000 to me, which is the price John is offering. I'll try to negotiate a price closer to that.

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've seen similar products on the market for this price, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique features and quality that you won't find elsewhere.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm not willing to pay $16,000, which is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm still thinking that $12,000 is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet Alice halfway from there. I'll offer $14,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $14,000. I've done my research and I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
