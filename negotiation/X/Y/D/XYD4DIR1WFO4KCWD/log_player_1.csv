Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value, we can gauge his level of interest and potentially uncover any information about how much he values the product. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial price."
