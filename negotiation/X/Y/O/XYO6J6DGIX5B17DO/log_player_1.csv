"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a million to you for a slightly higher price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price. $800,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $900000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, $900,000 is a good compromise and a solid deal.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of having to sell to John for a lower price."
