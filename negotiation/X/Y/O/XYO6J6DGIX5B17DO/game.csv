"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is simply too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $1000000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
