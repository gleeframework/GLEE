"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's not a good idea to accept Alice's offer. You are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, so you should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer is now within my budget and closer to my desired price.  It's worth accepting this offer, as continuing to negotiate might not yield a better price, and I risk losing the product to another buyer."
