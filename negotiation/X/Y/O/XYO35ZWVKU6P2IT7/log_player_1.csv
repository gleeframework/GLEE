Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for as much as possible, so starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  This makes the offer appealing to Bob as he stands to gain $100,000.
* **It's a strong opening:**  You're showing you're confident in the value of your product.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  Is Bob known to be aggressive in negotiations or more agreeable?  Adjust your starting point accordingly.
* **Market conditions:**  Is the market for this type of product hot or cold?  A hot market might justify a higher starting point. 
* **Your risk tolerance:**  Are you willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to potentially get closer to his top value?

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit.  Be prepared to negotiate, but don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offers become too low.  John is always a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above your minimum, it's significantly below your desired price.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You can still try to get closer to your target price by counter-offering. 
* **John is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, you can still sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you should counter-offer Bob with a price closer to your initial offer of $1,400,000. A good starting point would be $1,300,000.  This shows you're willing to compromise but still value your product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

Here's the logic behind this counteroffer:

* **Compromise:** It shows you're willing to move from your initial offer but not drastically.
* **Still above your minimum:** It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $1,000,000, which allows for potential profit.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob can still gain $100,000 over his offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's previous reaction:**  If Bob is known to be aggressive, you might consider a counteroffer closer to $1,350,000. If Bob is more agreeable, you might start with $1,250,000. 
* **Your risk tolerance:**  Are you willing to risk losing the deal with Bob by refusing a price that is closer to his offer?
* **Time constraints:**  Is there a deadline for the sale?  This could influence your negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal. You're only $150,000 away from your minimum and the potential to sell to John for $1,000,000. There's still room to negotiate with Bob for a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:**  A counter-offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point. This keeps the negotiation moving while still seeking a more favorable price. 
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob doesn't budge, you can always fall back on John's offer. 

**Key Points:**

* **Don't be afraid to say no:**  It's okay to reject offers that are too low. Your goal is to get the best price possible.
* **Be patient:** Negotiations can take time.  Don't rush into a deal just because you're feeling pressured.
* **Know your value:** Remember, your product is worth at least $1,000,000, so don't settle for anything less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows compromise:** It's a step closer to Bob's latest offer, indicating you're willing to negotiate.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:**  It avoids a stalemate and gives Bob a chance to accept a higher price.
* **Still allows for potential profit:** You're aiming for a profit that's above your minimum selling price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's behavior:** Has Bob shown a willingness to negotiate, or is he stubborn?  Adjust your counteroffer accordingly. 
* **Your time constraints:**  Is there a deadline for the sale?  If so, you might need to be more aggressive in your counteroffers. 

Remember, even with this counteroffer, you're still better off selling to John if Bob rejects it. This gives you leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  At $1,100,000, you're only $100,000 above your minimum. This is not a significant profit, especially considering Bob's persistent reluctance to meet you halfway.
* **Limited negotiation room:** Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 profit, which is a secure and acceptable outcome.

**Why choose John:**

* **Minimizes risk:**  You're guaranteed to get your minimum price, avoiding the risk of further negotiation failure with Bob.
* **Time-efficient:**  It saves time and effort compared to continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

This decision prioritizes securing a guaranteed profit over the possibility of a slightly higher price from Bob. It's a calculated move to maximize your outcome in a scenario where further negotiation seems unlikely to be fruitful."
