{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not setting a firm price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer.

This strategy gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still allowing for a smooth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could sell to John for $120, I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob further in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not going back to my initial price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still too low for me.  I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob further in hopes of getting closer to my desired price. I believe I can get a higher offer from Bob if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $95. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value, and I'm sure you won't regret this purchase.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by decreasing my price again, but not too drastically.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive & Encouraging:** I'm using positive language and a question to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

This counteroffer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and potentially reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you at $87.50. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, I'm not confident that I can get a significantly higher price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $120 and avoid further negotiation.  This ensures a guaranteed sale above my minimum acceptable price and saves me time and effort."
