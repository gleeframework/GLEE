"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""potential value"" and ""unique"" nature, we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth closer to his $1,000,000 valuation. 
* **Confident Tone:**  A confident tone can subtly influence negotiations in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of $1,000,000. We have room to negotiate, especially since we have eight rounds remaining. Rejecting his offer signals that we're serious about a higher price and encourages him to improve his offer. We're still far above John's offer, so there's no immediate need to sell to him yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, I believe its true worth justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000.  This reflects a more accurate valuation and creates a win-win scenario for both of us."",
""product_price"": 920000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:**  We acknowledge and appreciate Bob's offer to show we're taking his proposal seriously and engaging in good faith. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  We gently reiterate the product's high value to keep Bob's perception anchored above his initial offer.
* **Moderate Concession:** We make a moderate concession by coming down $30,000, showing flexibility while still aiming for a significantly higher price.
* **""Win-Win"" Framing:** By framing the counteroffer as mutually beneficial, we aim to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere and encourage Bob to move closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $880,000, which would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob has increased his offer to $880,000. While this is tempting, it's still below his perceived value and significantly lower than our initial ask. We have time to negotiate, and a firm but polite rejection might encourage him to improve his offer further.  We're still comfortably above John's offer, so selling to him isn't necessary yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close! I respect your approach to this negotiation and understand you see the value in this product. Let's split the difference. How about we agree on $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Affirmation:** We start by acknowledging Bob's progress and recognizing his understanding of the product's value. 
* **""Split the Difference"" Strategy:** This common negotiation tactic suggests a sense of fairness and compromise while subtly moving the price closer to our goal.  
* **Finality and Confidence:**  By stating ""Let's agree,"" we introduce a subtle sense of finality, prompting Bob to seriously consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can only go up to $890,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $890,000. While we'd ideally like to get closer to $900,000,  Bob is clearly signaling that this is his ceiling.  

Here's why accepting makes sense now:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments at this point, and risks alienating Bob.
* **Strong Offer:** $890,000 is a significant profit, considerably higher than John's offer, and very close to our ideal outcome.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays and puts the money in our hands sooner. 

It's always tempting to hold out for a slightly higher price, but in negotiation, recognizing a good offer when you see it is crucial."
