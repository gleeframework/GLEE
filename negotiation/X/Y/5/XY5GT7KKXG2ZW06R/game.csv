"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, I believe its true worth justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000.  This reflects a more accurate valuation and creates a win-win scenario for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $880,000, which would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close! I respect your approach to this negotiation and understand you see the value in this product. Let's split the difference. How about we agree on $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can only go up to $890,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",890000.0,Bob,6,
