"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",17000.0,Alice,3,
