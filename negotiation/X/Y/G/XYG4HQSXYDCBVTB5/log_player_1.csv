"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $175? It's a really great product, and I'm sure you'd find it valuable."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go above $150 for the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in between these prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his maximum budget of $150.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome than selling to John for $150."
