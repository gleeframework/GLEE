"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $12,000 is cheaper than buying from John for $15,000.
* While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, it's not guaranteed she'll go lower. 
*  You still save $3,000 compared to buying from John."
