Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110 price:**  This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Positive message:** A friendly and encouraging message can help Bob feel more comfortable with the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get the best price possible while acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay my initial asking price.  By starting high and offering a clear message, I create a starting point for negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product for a bit less. Would you consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is better than my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.  I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  

**Strategy:**

* **Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer signals to him that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.  
* **Counter-offer:** In the next round, I will make a counter-offer that is closer to my ideal price point. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm using John's offer of $120 as a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail. This allows me to walk away if Bob doesn't offer a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $105? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I've moved my price down to $105.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:**  $105 is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's desired price, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly message reaffirms my desire to reach an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

I'm using a ""meet in the middle"" approach, trying to find a price that is both acceptable to me and appealing to Bob.  My goal is to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $100 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Profit Margin:** While $100 is lower than my initial asking price, it still represents a $20 profit over my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. Continuing might risk losing Bob entirely, and John's offer provides a fallback option.
* **Compromise:**  Bob's offer is a fair compromise, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me a significantly better price.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation. This is a pragmatic decision considering my profit margin, potential negotiation fatigue, and the safety net provided by John's offer."
