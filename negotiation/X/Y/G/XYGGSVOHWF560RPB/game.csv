"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about $100? That's my absolute limit, but I'm sure we can both be happy with that deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
