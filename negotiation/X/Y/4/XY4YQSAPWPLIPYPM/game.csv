"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet at $13,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,
