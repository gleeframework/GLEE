Round 2

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet you at $12,500. I would like to propose $10,000 as a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a little more, Bob seems firm at $10,000. Accepting this offer is better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer, which is also $10,000."
