"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to try and meet halfway. This still leaves a fair profit for me while offering you a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and we're getting closer. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us. ",1325000.0,Alice,5,
