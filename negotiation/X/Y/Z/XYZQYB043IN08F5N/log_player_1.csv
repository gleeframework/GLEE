Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize your profit while still being appealing to Bob.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Your Minimum:** You are willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, so any price above that is a win for you.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so a price below that gives him a potential profit.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Offering $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants a lower price. You can potentially come down a bit without jeopardizing your minimum desired profit."
