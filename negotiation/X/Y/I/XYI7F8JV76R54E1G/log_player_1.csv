Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, which means I can walk away from the deal if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $15000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  While tempting, I'm not desperate for a sale and there's a chance I can do better.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price.  
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is secure, I want to explore if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,500 to make this deal work.  This reflects the unique value of the product.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value, hoping to justify the higher price.
* **Win-Win:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both of us, making it more likely for Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $16000. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is only $1,000 below my initial asking price of $17,500. This is a good result, considering I was willing to accept his initial offer of $15,000.
* **Risk of Going Lower:** There's a chance that Bob will refuse to go any higher.
* **Time and Effort:** Continued negotiation will take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000,  $16,000 is a better deal, making it worthwhile to accept."
