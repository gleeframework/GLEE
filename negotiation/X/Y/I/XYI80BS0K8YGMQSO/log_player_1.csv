Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that's slightly above Bob's estimated value but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the benefit for both parties, hoping to encourage Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. I'll reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and offer the product for $1,375,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to finalize the deal. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000 for the product. I think this is as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is getting tense and Bob's offers are not reaching my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement with him within the limited rounds is too high. Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure a secure deal and maximize my profit."
