"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'll adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd like to try and get a bit more. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm still aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but acknowledging that Bob is not willing to pay my initial asking price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. I'm comfortable accepting this offer as it's a decent increase from my minimum and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. There's a risk of not reaching a better price, but I'm happy with this outcome."
