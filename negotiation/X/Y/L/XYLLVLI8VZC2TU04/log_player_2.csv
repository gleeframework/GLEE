"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  However, $12000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my initial offer and still gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is now offering it for $13,000. This is a significant savings.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could potentially get a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and forcing him to buy from John at $15,000 outweighs the potential for further savings.  
* **Time:**  Accepting the offer keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids the risk of running out of rounds."
