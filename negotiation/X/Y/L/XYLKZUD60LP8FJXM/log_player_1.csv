"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  It also expresses a belief in the product's value to encourage Bob to seriously consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell. By rejecting, I can:

* **See if Bob is willing to increase his offer:** He may be willing to come up a bit to secure the deal.
* **Gain leverage:** Showing I'm not desperate strengthens my position in future negotiations. 
* **Keep the option of selling to John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I still have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's true value and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while staying above my minimum price. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This phrasing encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above $1400000. How about $1550000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now at $1,550,000, which is above my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for the $1,500,000 from John outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly higher price.  

By accepting this offer, I secure a sale that exceeds my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiations."
