"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $2,200,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. This is a rare opportunity to own something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong initial offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique features"" and ""exceptional"" nature to justify the high price. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  I'm aware I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.  This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2,200,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates serious interest, and I'm willing to continue the discussion to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly significant. Let's find a middle ground â€“ I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession of $200,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Holding Ground:**  I'm not dropping below $2,000,000 yet. This keeps the offer above Bob's perceived value and maintains room for further negotiation, aiming for a price closer to $1,900,000.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a collaborative tone, emphasizing the goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my target price. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it. $1,900,000 represents a significant profit above my minimum, and closing the deal now ensures a successful outcome."
