"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent price, I believe I can do better. I'm confident in the value of my product and want to maximize my profits.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still a good profit for me. It shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position."

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  Although it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a better price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm making another counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a further concession, but I'm still confident I can get a better price than John's offer.  I'm aiming for a good middle ground between what I want and what Bob seems willing to pay."
