"Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both parties.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
