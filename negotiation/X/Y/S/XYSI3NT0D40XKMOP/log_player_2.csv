"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I could let it go for $16,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price is getting closer to an acceptable range, her stating ""$16,000 is my final offer"" limits further negotiation.  It's unlikely she'll go down to $15,000. Since you have the option to buy from John at $15,000, it's the best financial decision to secure the product at the lowest known price."
