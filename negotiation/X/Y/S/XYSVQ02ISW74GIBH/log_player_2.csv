"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible.  $110 is still above his maximum price point of $80. It's better to reject and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows his maximum price point is $80. He's starting at his target price to see if Alice is willing to meet him there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his $80 limit.  He can continue to negotiate and hopefully get Alice closer to his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer slightly from $80, showing some willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. He's hoping Alice will accept or at least counter with a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget with this offer, but he wants to see if he can get Alice closer to his target of $80. He's already made some concessions, but he's not ready to settle yet.  There's still time to negotiate and he doesn't want to lose out on potentially getting the product for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price point, showing that he's serious about buying the product. He's offering $90, which is a compromise between his $85 and Alice's $95.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget. If Alice rejects this, Bob can then evaluate whether he wants to continue negotiating or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much from her price.  It is getting down to the wire with only 3 rounds left.  Bob can either accept $98 and risk losing out on a better deal or buy from John now and guarantee his desired price point. At this point, it's more beneficial to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
