Considering its worth and the benefits it provides, I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $95. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored just for you, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

While Alice's offer of $95 is less than her perceived value, it's still more than your maximum budget of $80. John offers the product at your target price, making it the most financially sensible option."
