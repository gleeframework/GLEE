"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit above my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his initial response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to make at least $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. I'll reject his offer and counter with my own. I have time and can see if he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is still a good profit for me and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate but need to make at least $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,250,000.  This is closer to my minimum acceptable price and shows I'm serious about reaching a deal with Bob. I'm hoping this offer is compelling enough to get us closer to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  We are nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum.  I've shown my willingness to negotiate, but the potential for profit with Bob is becoming unlikely. John is guaranteed to buy for my minimum, and it's time to secure that sale."
