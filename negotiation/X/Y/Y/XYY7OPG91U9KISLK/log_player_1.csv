Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit. Offering a price close to Bob's valuation ($1,100,000) gives you the best chance of securing a deal while still making a significant profit ($300,000).

**Why this strategy makes sense:**

This approach aims to strike a balance:

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, making it an attractive proposition.
* **Profitable for You:** The price is substantially higher than your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a large profit margin. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, starting with a strong initial offer that leans towards your desired outcome is a strategic approach in negotiation."
