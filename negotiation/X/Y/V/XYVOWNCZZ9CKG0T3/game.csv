"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny.  I'm starting with a price of $1200000.  Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1200000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900000 is a bit too low for me. Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1000000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950000, which is a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $975000?  It's a compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
