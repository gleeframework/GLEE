Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1550000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
