"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a fair compromise. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your financial limitations. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $1,300,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $1,300,000 is still too far below the product's worth.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, at $1,450,000.  This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
