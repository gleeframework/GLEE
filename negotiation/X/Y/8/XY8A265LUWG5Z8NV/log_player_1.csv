Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's slightly below Bob's perceived value, but still gives me a good profit margin. This should incentivize him to accept, but also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $75.  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further. Selling to John for $80 is a sure thing and guarantees I don't lose money."
