"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more in line with my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,800,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  I'm still pretty far off from that number though.  To be frank, anything over $800,000 is going to be a very tough sell for me.  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. It seems like we're looking at this from two different perspectives. To be transparent, I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe this product can truly benefit you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being transparent.  I understand you have other options, but $1,100,000 is still pretty far from what I had in mind.  If you're willing to come down to $800,000, I'm ready to close this deal today.  Otherwise, I think I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
