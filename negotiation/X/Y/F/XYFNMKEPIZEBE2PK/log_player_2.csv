# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

Alice is firming up her price and unwilling to budge further. While the deal is getting better, it's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
