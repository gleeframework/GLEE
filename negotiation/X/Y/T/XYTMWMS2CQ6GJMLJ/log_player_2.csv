"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $12,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800

You are still trying to save as much money as possible, and $12,800 is still a bit higher than you are aiming for.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter again and see if Alice will come down further."
