{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation. Here's why:

* **My minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable starting point:** $1,000,000 is a good middle ground. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:** This gives Bob the opportunity to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still ensuring I make a profit.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter-offer, aiming to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. However, I will always have John's offer as a backup, so I won't settle for less than $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my goal than John's offer, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I believe I can do better. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Bob's value:** He's clearly willing to pay more than $950,000, as he initially rejected my $1,000,000 offer.
* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain the upper hand in the negotiation. 
* **Aiming higher:**  I'll use this opportunity to counter with a price closer to my desired $1,200,000, aiming for a higher profit. 

I'm confident that by pushing a little further, I can secure a better deal for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to bridge the gap!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Aiming high:** I'm pushing for a price closer to my ideal goal of $1,200,000. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm highlighting the product's value and emphasizing a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Room for compromise:** $1,100,000 still leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential middle ground.

By presenting a clear rationale and proposing a price that is still within Bob's range, I aim to:

* **Maintain my position:**  Show that I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my initial offer.
* **Encourage further negotiation:**  Push Bob to consider a higher price while remaining open to a compromise.
* **Get closer to my goal:**  Ultimately, I want to maximize my profits and secure a sale closer to the product's true value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me! Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Significant profit:**  $1,050,000 is well above my minimum of $800,000, and it's getting close to my ideal price.
* **Likely best outcome:**  Bob's willingness to compromise suggests he's close to his limit.  Pushing for more could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, and John is always a viable alternative.

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a substantial profit while minimizing the risk of losing a sale. It's a good outcome for both parties."
