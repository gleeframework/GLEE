"Alice,  $12,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,500. It's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I can't go any higher than $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
