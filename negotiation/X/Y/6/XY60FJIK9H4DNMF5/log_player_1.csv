{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's worth to Bob, but I also want to avoid losing the deal completely. This price leaves room for negotiation and gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can push for a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which would allow us both to have a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,325,000. That's the lowest I can go, considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is slightly higher than what John is offering.  It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe further negotiation might take too much time and energy.  Accepting this offer ensures a reasonably profitable deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
