"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both live with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $975,000.  Let's split the difference and get this deal done.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to come down. However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This is a very fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're almost there. I understand you need to get the best price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it's time to close this deal. Let's make this happen!",1025000.0,Bob,8,
