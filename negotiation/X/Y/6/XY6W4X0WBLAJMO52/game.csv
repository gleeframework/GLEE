"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is the best price I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a little too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,400,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer it to you for $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
