"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?  I'm really interested in the product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
