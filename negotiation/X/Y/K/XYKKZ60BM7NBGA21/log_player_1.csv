I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to secure a good portion of the potential value for myself.  However, I'm aware that Bob is willing to pay more, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's higher than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value to me. This should be enticing enough for Bob while still allowing for further negotiation in future rounds."
