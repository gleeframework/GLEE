Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle â€“ how about $19,000? I'm confident you'll see a considerable return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $19,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to you.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is closer, but still below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $15,500? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle again -  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and we could finalise the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Bob's offer of $14,000 is a strong deal. It's above my minimum acceptable price and haggling further might risk losing the sale altogether."
