Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $145 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, which is still a good value for you considering your asking price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
