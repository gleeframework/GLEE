"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115, which still gives you a good price while ensuring I get a fair deal. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Can you consider that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
