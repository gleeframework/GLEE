Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but also incentivizes him to accept.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** You still have room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial offer. 
* **It provides a clear and friendly message:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9500. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of offering $9000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, $9,000 is a reasonable compromise and still higher than Bob's initial offer.  It's also close enough to my minimum value that I'm willing to accept it."
