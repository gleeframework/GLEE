"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $10000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really determined to get this product, but my absolute maximum is $12000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is your absolute maximum, and I'm willing to try to meet you there. I can offer you the product for $13000. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to my limit, but I can go a little higher.  $13000 is still a bit out of reach, but I'm willing to pay $12500.  This is my final offer,  if it's not acceptable, I'll need to go with John's offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12500 is your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $13500. It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,7,
