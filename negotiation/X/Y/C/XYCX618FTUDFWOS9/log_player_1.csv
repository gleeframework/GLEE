{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a middle ground. It's above your minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $150 to Bob. This way, you can potentially earn a good amount while still being open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $100 is a better offer than selling to John, it's still below the value I want for the product. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $105 is closer to my target and still significantly better than selling to John.  It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
