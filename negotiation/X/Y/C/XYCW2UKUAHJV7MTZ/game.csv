"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the product's value to me, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering your own value of $800,000.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm not ready to accept $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
