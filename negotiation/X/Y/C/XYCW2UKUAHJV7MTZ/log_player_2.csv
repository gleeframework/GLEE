"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a lower price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the product's value to me, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering your own value of $800,000.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm not ready to accept $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal. It's a significant discount from John's price of $1,200,000 and is within a reasonable range considering Alice's value of $800,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
