"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, you should reject Alice's offer of $1,000,000. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  There's no harm in negotiating further, as you have the option of buying from John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a bold move, but it shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  If Alice rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer in the next round based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject her offer again and try for a lower price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm determined to get the best possible deal.  While $900,000 is better than $1,500,000, it's still a lot of money.  I want to see if I can get it for closer to my initial counteroffer of $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $800,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer of $750,000 and Alice's current offer of $900,000.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to convince Alice to sell."
