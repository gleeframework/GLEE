Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but it allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to drop the price if necessary. It's also important to remember that I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, so I'm not under immense pressure to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can push for a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me and shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price I can get from John. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially get a lower offer from Bob. I'll accept his offer and secure the deal."
