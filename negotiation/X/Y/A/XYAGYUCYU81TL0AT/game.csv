"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Considering your value for this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. This would be a quick and clean deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
