"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product but my budget is $8000. Would you be willing to negotiate closer to that figure? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. $10000 is closer, but I'm still losing a bit at that price. Let's split the difference â€“ $11000, and we have a deal.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11000, but I'm willing to go up to $9500. That's my final offer.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,6,
