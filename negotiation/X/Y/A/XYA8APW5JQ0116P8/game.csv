"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  Let's try to find some middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $1025000. This is a compromise that's closer to your last offer, but still reflects the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but I'm still working with a budget.  I can offer $975000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $1050000, which is the same as my previous offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
