"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible opportunity. This product has the potential to be a game-changer for your business, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm starting with a price of $1400000, reflecting the value it holds. I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a specific price point. While I acknowledge your perspective on the market conditions, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. It's a substantial discount from my initial offer, showcasing my commitment to a successful partnership.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1300000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair market value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your position.  While I value our negotiation, $1150000 is still not in line with the product's true value.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1250000. This offers a fair balance between our desired outcomes and ensures a win-win situation.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $1175000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiation so far.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a price point that works for you. While I appreciate your offer, $1175000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1225000. This represents a significant concession on my part and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome for both of us.  I'm confident this price will be satisfactory for you and allow us to close this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
