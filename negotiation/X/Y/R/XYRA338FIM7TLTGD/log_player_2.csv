"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $9,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. Since Bob has the option to purchase the product from John for $8,000, he should reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate further."
