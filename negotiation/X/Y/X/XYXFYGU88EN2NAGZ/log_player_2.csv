"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's own valuation of the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's offer is still above her own valuation, Bob can make a counteroffer that's still above her valuation but lower than Alice's initial offer. By offering $1,050,000, Bob is showing that he is serious about buying the product but also trying to get a better deal. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than her own valuation of the product, and also higher than Bob's previous counteroffer. This indicates that she is willing to negotiate further. Bob should continue trying to lower the price by rejecting the offer and making a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that both he and Alice can agree on. He wants to get the best deal possible, but also wants to ensure the negotiation doesn't drag on too long. This counteroffer represents a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still being below Alice's latest offer. This strategy allows for potential agreement while keeping Bob within his desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer significantly, and it's now closer to Bob's desired price range. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the possibility of needing to buy from John for a higher price increases with each round. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price, within his budget, and avoids any further risk of losing the deal."
