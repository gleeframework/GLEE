"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a significant amount above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still demonstrating the value of the product. I'm confident Bob will recognize the worth and potentially counter-offer, giving us a chance to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but still above my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and counter-offer in the next round. It's important to try and get closer to my target price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000, a compromise from my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, though it's getting closer. I'm going to reject this offer again and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, selling to John becomes a more viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
```

I'm lowering the price again to $1,090,000. This is another compromise, but it's important to keep the price above my minimum to avoid selling to John prematurely. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer, but if not, I'll need to start considering selling to John."
