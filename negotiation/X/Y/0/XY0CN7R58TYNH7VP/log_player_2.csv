"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, ideally for $80. Alice's offer of $120 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's ideal price of $80, it's still a bit too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further. There's still room for Alice to come down in price and Bob can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $100 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference.  How about $92.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm really hoping to make this work."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $92.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $92.50, which would be $96.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  While $96.5 is closer to his ideal price, it's still too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should see if he can push Alice further down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $96.5 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm sure you'd be happy to sell it at this price and I would be happy to buy it."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $95. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a few rounds left, but Alice has clearly shown she's unwilling to budge much further.  Even though they're close in price, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible.  Buying from John for $80 ensures he gets the best possible deal, and it's better to secure that than to risk Alice counter-offering even higher in the next round."
