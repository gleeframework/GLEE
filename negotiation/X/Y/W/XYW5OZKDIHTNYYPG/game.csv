"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. Considering the product's value and your previous offers, I'm willing to compromise at $8,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
