"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This price still offers you a significant value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're committed to getting the best price, and I respect that.  Let's compromise again.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This gives you a great deal while ensuring I can still profit from the sale.  What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
