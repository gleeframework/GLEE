"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's a substantial savings for you, and still a significant profit for me.  Let me know if you're interested, or if you'd like to negotiate further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can get the same product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
