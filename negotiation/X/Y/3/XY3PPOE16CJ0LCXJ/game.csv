"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $140 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $120.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure it will be a good deal for you too.",120.0,Bob,4,
