Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
