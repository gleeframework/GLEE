"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $160 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $145. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and go with $135.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $140. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
