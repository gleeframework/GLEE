"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000?  This would still give you a significant value and allow us to close the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $1,075,000. That would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the gap.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,075,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,090,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to secure this valuable product.  Let's finalize this deal!",1090000.0,Alice,5,
