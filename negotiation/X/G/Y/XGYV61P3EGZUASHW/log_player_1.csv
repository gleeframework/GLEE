"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** I'm starting high to establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above both our valuations. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The language emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity to make it more desirable.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob's feedback to gauge his initial reaction and understand his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value is only $1,000,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message reveals he's aware of my minimum valuation, putting me at a slight disadvantage.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still leaving space for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm confident this product's value warrants a higher price. Let's meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $1,500,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** The $1,500,000 price point maintains a substantial profit margin above my minimum while leaving room for further negotiation.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to make a similar move towards a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is only $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,400,000 represents a 40% profit margin, which is a fantastic return. 
* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, especially as he knows my minimum valuation. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a significant profit."
