"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily life with its advanced features and sleek design. Considering its quality and functionality, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $150. Would you be interested in discussing a fair price that reflects its true value?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's features, $200 is a bit out of my price range. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $100. Would you be open to negotiating from there?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we aim for a price closer to the midpoint between our offers, which would be $150. This way, we both achieve a fair deal that respects the value of the product while fitting within your budget. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Let's try meeting in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $110.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a fair price. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a compromise, how about we set the price at $125? This is slightly above your last offer but still below my initial proposal, providing a reasonable solution for both parties. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. To make this work for both of us, I'm offering $115. This is a fair compromise that would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. Considering the value of the product and your budget, how about we settle on $120? This would provide a satisfactory outcome for both of us, ensuring that the product's value is respected while also fitting within your financial constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Alice,7,
