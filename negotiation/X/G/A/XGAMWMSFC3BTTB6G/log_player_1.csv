Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget. If he rejects, we can negotiate down from there.  I'm also aware I have a backup option with John, so I can be more aggressive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. I believe this price point is reasonable and might be acceptable to Bob, especially since he's already shown interest by making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than my ideal price, it's only $20,000 below my minimum.  Considering the negotiation process and the possibility of further rejections, accepting this offer is the most strategic decision. It guarantees a sale above my minimum and saves time and effort compared to further negotiation."
