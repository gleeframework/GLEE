Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value but still significantly below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling that I'm open to negotiating further if necessary. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer provides security and allows me to walk away from negotiations if they become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  I can use this to my advantage by making a counteroffer.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as an option gives me the leverage to walk away if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still reflects the value of this product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm counter-offering with $950,000, which is a significant jump from Bob's offer but still allows for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Openness to Compromise:** I'm using language that suggests a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Setting a Clear Boundary:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also establishing a lower limit for the product's price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and represents a compromise from my last counteroffer.
* **Reaching a Near-Optimal Price:** While $900,000 is still below my ideal price, it's much closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of Loss:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions on my part or even a breakdown in negotiations.  There's also the risk of John's offer becoming unavailable.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer maximizes my immediate profit and allows me to close the deal.

**Next Steps:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
