"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $90 to see if we can make this work.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about $88?  It's closer to my budget, and hopefully, we can finalize this.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go as low as $92, but that's my final offer.  If you're not able to meet that price, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",92.0,Alice,5,
