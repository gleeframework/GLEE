Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $95 is a good starting point, allowing for potential counteroffers without going below my minimum price.
* **Considering John's offer:**  While I'm aiming to sell to Bob, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net.  

**Note:** This is just my initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While John offers a guaranteed $100, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap between our desired prices.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $100. I will also continue to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $90 to see if we can make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $90 represents a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Closing the gap:**  This offer reduces the difference between our desired prices, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not going too low too quickly, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Balancing with John:**  While $90 is less than John's offer, it's still a decent price and keeps the possibility of a sale with Bob open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about $88?  It's closer to my budget, and hopefully, we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $88 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $100 threshold.
* **Risk of stalemate:** Accepting $88 risks a stalemate, as Bob might not budge further.
* **Leverage for a final counteroffer:**  Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to make one final counteroffer, potentially securing a better price closer to my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price close to my minimum. If he rejects it, I will sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go as low as $92, but that's my final offer.  If you're not able to meet that price, I'll have to move on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about closing the deal but am not willing to go any lower.
* **Compromise:** $92 is a compromise that allows me to maintain my desired profit margin while showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Pressure:**  Highlighting the potential for selling to John creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Clear Expectations:** This final offer avoids further back-and-forth, pushing Bob to either accept or reject the deal."
