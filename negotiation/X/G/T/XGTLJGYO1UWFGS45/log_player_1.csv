Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is increasing his offers in smaller increments. It's unlikely he will reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 within the remaining rounds. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob or having the negotiation fail."
