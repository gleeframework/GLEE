I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a significant discount from her initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay."

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show good faith and hopefully get closer to Alice's desired price.  This is a compromise, and it's still a good deal compared to John's offer."
