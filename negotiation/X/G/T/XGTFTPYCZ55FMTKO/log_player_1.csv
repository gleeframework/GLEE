Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation, but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some wiggle room while also demonstrating my willingness to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm still a little ways off at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $80.  That's a good price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
