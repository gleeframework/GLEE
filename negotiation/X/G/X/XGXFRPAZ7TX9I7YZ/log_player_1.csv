Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer of $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, even if it's just a dollar or two. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $119 seems like a significantly better deal than $120, potentially enticing Bob even though it's still a high markup from his perceived value.

It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer.  If he's savvy, he'll realize the product isn't worth that much to him and might try to lowball you. You'll need to decide if you want to negotiate further or take the guaranteed $120 from John."
