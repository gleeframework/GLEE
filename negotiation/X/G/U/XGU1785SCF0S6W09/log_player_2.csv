"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially save more money by counter-offering. You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given your value for the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good price considering your value for the product is $1,000,000. You can save $125,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
