"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1100000.0
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I can meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1025000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is the price I was willing to pay from the beginning. Can you consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,6,,

"I've already offered you the product at $1025000, and you've come back to $1000000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that, so I'll make one more counteroffer: $1050000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,,
