"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $12,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $12,500?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
