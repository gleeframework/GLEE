"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to maximize your potential profit, but it's also reasonable enough that Bob might be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $12,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $12,500?  That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point,  $12,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer and still significantly higher than selling to John. It's worth closing the deal now to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
