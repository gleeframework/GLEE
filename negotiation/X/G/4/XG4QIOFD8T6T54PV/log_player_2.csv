**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000). It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still a good deal for me, but I can likely get it for even less.  I'm going to try to counter again and see if I can push for a lower price."
