"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford to pay $2,000,000. My maximum budget is $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price right now, or we can continue negotiating. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price.  To be frank, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,600,000. This reflects the true value and potential it holds. Are you open to finding a middle ground somewhere in that range?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
