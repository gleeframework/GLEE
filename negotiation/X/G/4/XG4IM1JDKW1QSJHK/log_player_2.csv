"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is far above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Rejecting allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially save a lot more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford to pay $2,000,000. My maximum budget is $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price right now, or we can continue negotiating. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price.  To be frank, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,600,000. This reflects the true value and potential it holds. Are you open to finding a middle ground somewhere in that range? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step down from her initial price, $1,600,000 is still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as Bob can still get the product for a lower price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
