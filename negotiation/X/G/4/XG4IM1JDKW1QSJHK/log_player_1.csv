"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential returns,"" I aim to anchor Bob's perception of value closer to my asking price. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves considerable room for me to come down in subsequent rounds if needed,  while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford to pay $2,000,000. My maximum budget is $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price right now, or we can continue negotiating. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum budget, leaving no room for negotiation upwards from his side. Accepting would mean selling significantly below my minimum. While selling to John is an option, I still have rounds to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price.  To be frank, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,600,000. This reflects the true value and potential it holds. Are you open to finding a middle ground somewhere in that range?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer, Not Acceptance:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer outright, as it's too low. However, I'm not walking away yet.
* **Revealing (Part of) My Hand:** By stating my ""absolute minimum,"" I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. This also signals that I'm serious and not going to go much lower.
* **Call for Collaboration:**  By asking if Bob is ""open to finding middle ground,"" I'm suggesting we work together for a mutually agreeable solution. This keeps the negotiation alive.
* **Strategic Price:** The $1,600,000  counteroffer is still above my absolute floor ($1,500,000 from John), but it gives me room to negotiate down slightly if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000 (considering John's offer).  
* **Diminishing Returns in Negotiation:** While I could try to push for more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, especially since he presented this as a compromise (""meet you halfway""). 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds and secures a good profit."
