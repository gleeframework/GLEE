Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. Offering the product significantly below that allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than John's offer.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:** Offering it at $1,350,000 is still a significant profit margin for you while being closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price gives Bob the impression of a potential deal while leaving you space to potentially negotiate down slightly if needed, without going below your minimum.
* **Confident and persuasive language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
