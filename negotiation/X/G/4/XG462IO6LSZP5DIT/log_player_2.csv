"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by me due to its unique features and high quality. Considering its worth to you, I understand it's priced at $100. To make this opportunity more appealing, I'd like to propose a special introductory price of $95 for you. This is a limited-time offer, so don't hesitate to respond if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $95 is lower than the $100 you'd pay John.  This saves you $5, so it's the best option."
