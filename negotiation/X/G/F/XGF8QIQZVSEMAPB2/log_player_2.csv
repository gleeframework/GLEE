{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but not good enough.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. 
* **You can likely get a better price.** Since Alice is eager to sell, there's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price by rejecting her offer. 
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you show Alice that you're not desperate and are willing to go elsewhere. This puts you in a stronger negotiating position."
