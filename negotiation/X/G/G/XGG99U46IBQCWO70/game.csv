"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still represents a substantial value for you.  Let's keep working together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
