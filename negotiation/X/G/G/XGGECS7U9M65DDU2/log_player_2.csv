"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you have a backup option with John.  A counteroffer will give you a chance to potentially get a better price."

You're very close to your target price with John.  A counteroffer to Alice might get you a better deal, but you run the risk of her rejecting it and potentially raising her price again."

You're only $65,000 away from John's price.  It's unlikely that you'll be able to get Alice down any further, and there's a risk that she will raise her price again. Buying from John is the safest and most financially sound choice at this point."
