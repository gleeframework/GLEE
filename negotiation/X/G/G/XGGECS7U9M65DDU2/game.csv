"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired selling point. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my desired selling point.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,075,000. While that's closer to my target, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both of our needs.  What do you say?",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,060,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000, which is just $5,000 more than your latest offer. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1065000.0,Alice,5,
