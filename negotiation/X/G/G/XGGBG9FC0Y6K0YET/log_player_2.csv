"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, leaving room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down closer to her product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($10,000) while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a significant discount from my original price, and it's a great deal for you. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, there's still room for negotiation. A counteroffer closer to $11,000 could potentially secure a better deal without risking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

This counteroffer aims for a price point near the middle of Alice's current offer ($12,000) and our previous counteroffer ($10,500). It maintains a polite and collaborative tone, suggesting a win-win solution."
