"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price is fair given my budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also giving you a good deal on the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This price is still within my budget and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's aim for a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $1,050,000 is too low, I can offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
