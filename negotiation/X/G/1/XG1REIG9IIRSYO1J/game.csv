"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay this price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This reflects the value I know it holds while still being a significant deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
