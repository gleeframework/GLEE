Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This reflects the value I know it holds while still being a significant deal for you.
