"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a great opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a price that is slightly above its value to you, ensuring a profitable transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to push the price down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In order to find a mutually beneficial solution, I would like to propose a price of $13,500 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**
