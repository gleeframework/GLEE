"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it reasonable.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
