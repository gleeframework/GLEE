Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.  Let's consider $1,025,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer is getting closer, but we're still a fair bit apart. To meet you closer to the middle, I propose $1,000,000 even.  This considers your budget while reflecting the product's inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice has met you at her value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is well below your maximum budget. Take the deal!"
