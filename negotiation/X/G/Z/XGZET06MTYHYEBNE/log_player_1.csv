Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.** This ensures I'm getting a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value of $10,000.** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

By starting in the middle, I'm hoping to encourage a quick and mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter-offer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation. Bob has already shown he's willing to pay over $9,000, so I'm going to counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $9,250.  This is a small decrease from my previous offer, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this price is still within a range where Bob will find the deal attractive, while also getting me closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my target price of $9,500, Bob's offer of $9,200 is only $300 less than my last offer, and it's significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale completely. It's time to close the deal."
