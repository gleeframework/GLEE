Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to me and is a fair compromise.

While Bob's latest offer is tempting, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
