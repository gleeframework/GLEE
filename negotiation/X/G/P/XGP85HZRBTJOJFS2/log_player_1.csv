I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still exceeding my minimum value for the product."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum value but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility while maintaining a fair price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not enough.  At this point, I'm confident I can get a better price from John, so I'm going to sell to him instead."
