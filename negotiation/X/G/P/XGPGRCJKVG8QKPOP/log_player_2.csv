(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can likely get a better price than $100, so it's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $92.50?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92.5 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still within your budget, and Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. It's worth another round to see if you can get closer to your target price of $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $95 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about $91? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $92, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're getting closer to your target price, but you should try to negotiate a bit more. It might be worth a counteroffer to see if Alice will budge. If not, you're still saving money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really hoping to get it for $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally finalize the sale at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. How about we meet at $91.50? It's a great deal for you, and I think it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's worth accepting Alice's offer. You've gotten a decent price, and it's within your budget.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or you running out of rounds and having to buy from John for a higher price."
