"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
