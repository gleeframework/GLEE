{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit, but it's still outside of your ideal price range.  You've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  Since John is offering the product at your maximum price, it's time to secure the deal and avoid further risk of a failed negotiation."
