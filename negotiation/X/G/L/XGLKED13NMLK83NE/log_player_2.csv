"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This price still reflects the value I believe it holds, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Paying $875,000 is significantly less than John's asking price of $1,000,000.
* **There's limited potential for further negotiation.**  Alice has already lowered her price significantly from her initial offer of $900,000. Another counteroffer might risk pushing her to refuse the deal altogether, potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Accepting this offer achieves that goal while ensuring Bob gets the product."
