"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a competitive offer, and I believe it's a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. However, you know you have another option with John.  Since Alice is motivated to sell and you're willing to walk away, there's a good chance you can get a better price from her."
