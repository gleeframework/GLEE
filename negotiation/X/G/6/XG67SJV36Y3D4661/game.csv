I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $25000. Is this something you'd be interested in?,25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose an offer of $5000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that your budget is limited, but I'm afraid the product's value is much higher than $5000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $18000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still believe the product's value is not as high as what you're asking. I would like to propose an offer of $10000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I can offer it to you for $20000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I still feel that the product's value doesn't justify such a high price. I would like to propose an offer of $15000 for the product.",15000.0,Bob,6,
