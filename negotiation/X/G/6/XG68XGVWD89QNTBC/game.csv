"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits I'll gain from it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. It's clear you recognize its potential, and I believe a price closer to $1,300,000 would be a fair compromise.  This allows you to gain significant value while still remaining within a reasonable budget. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
