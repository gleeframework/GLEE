"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He's willing to pay up to $100, and Alice's minimum is $80, so there's room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $92. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $92, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will stick to her final offer, leaving him with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice in this situation."
