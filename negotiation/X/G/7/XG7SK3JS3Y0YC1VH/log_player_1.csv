{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. It also sets a positive tone, emphasizing the value of the product for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm going to counteroffer to try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product. It's a unique piece, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,750?"", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Although Bob has come closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable accepting his offer. I'm confident that selling to John will guarantee my minimum price of $10,000.  It's time to move on."
