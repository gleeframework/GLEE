"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's split the difference and go for $8,750. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",8750.0,Bob,4,
