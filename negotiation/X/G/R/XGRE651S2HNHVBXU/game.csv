"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $8,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the product's value to you. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $10,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while considering your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer aligns better with your financial situation.",10000.0,Alice,3,
