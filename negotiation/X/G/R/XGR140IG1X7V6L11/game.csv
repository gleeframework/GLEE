"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $60 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers a lot of value, and I need to be closer to $140 to make this work. How about we meet in the middle?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still quite a ways off from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $130, but that's my best price.  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that's still a bit too high for me.  I can do $80, but that's my absolute maximum.",80.0,Bob,6,
