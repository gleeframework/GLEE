Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, for a price that reflects its true value. I believe this is a deal you won't want to miss. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message short and focused on the value proposition for Bob. I emphasize that I know he's interested and that this is a special offer. 
* **Product Price:** I'm offering the product at $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept and the maximum Bob is willing to pay. 

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, I can afford to be bold and ask for the full value of the product. There's no need to negotiate lower in this scenario.  This strategy maximizes my potential profit."
