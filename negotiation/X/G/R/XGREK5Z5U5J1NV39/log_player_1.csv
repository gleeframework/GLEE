Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows us to potentially maximize profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial discount compared to John's willingness to pay ($1,500,000).
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. If Bob pushes back, we can slightly lower the price while still remaining above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob's interest.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale at the highest possible price and not losing Bob as a buyer, forcing us to accept the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
