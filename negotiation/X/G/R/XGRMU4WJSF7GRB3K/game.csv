"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final offer in this range, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
