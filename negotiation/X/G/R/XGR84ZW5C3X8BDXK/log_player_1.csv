"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate towards a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired $1,000,000 mark.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and lead to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000, $920,000 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. It's also important to remember that each round is valuable and I need to make a decision before the 10 rounds are up."
