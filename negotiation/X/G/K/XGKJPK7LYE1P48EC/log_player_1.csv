"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential and your known interest, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit.  The $1,150,000 offer is slightly below Bob's perceived value but well above my minimum.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial offer provides space for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push for a higher price, especially since we are only in round 2. I'm confident I can get closer to $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects the product's true value and allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm on getting a price above the midpoint between our initial positions.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation. 
* **Maintaining Confidence:**  The tone remains positive and solution-oriented."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $1,075,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now trying to anchor the negotiation closer to his initial offer. While $1,075,000 is above my absolute minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm willing to take a calculated risk and continue negotiating for a couple more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It's clear this product has significant value for you. To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,110,000.  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($15,000) to show I'm willing to negotiate but also to signal I'm reaching my limit.
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him why he's interested in the first place.
* **Creating Urgency (Subtle):**  By saying ""to move things along,"" I'm subtly hinting that time is a factor, even though we have several rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, which would be $1,085,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I believe I could push for a slightly higher price, the gains are becoming smaller with each round. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,085,000 still represents a significant profit.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or walking away. Securing the deal now avoids those risks. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Holding out for a potentially slightly better deal with Bob means delaying the opportunity to sell to John for $1,000,000. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a larger profit without further delay."
