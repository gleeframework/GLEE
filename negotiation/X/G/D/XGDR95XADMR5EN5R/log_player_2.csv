"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this is a great starting point. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you and my own expectations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to budge closer to your $1,000,000 limit.  Further negotiation is probably a waste of time and you risk Alice increasing her price further. John offers a sure thing at your desired price."
