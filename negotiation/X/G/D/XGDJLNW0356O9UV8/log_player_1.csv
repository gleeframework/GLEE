I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price that is above my minimum threshold of $80 but leaves room for potential negotiation. I believe Bob will be interested in purchasing the product at this price, as it's still below its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
