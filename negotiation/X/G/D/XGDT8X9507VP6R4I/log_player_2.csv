"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is less than John's price of $15,000.
* **It's within your budget.** The product is worth no more than $15,000 to you, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $3,000 compared to buying from John."
