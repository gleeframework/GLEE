Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be more assertive in your initial offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually lower your price, but never go below your minimum of $80."
