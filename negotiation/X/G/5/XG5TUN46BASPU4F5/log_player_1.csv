Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price, and waiting carries the risk of him lowering his offer. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome in this scenario."
