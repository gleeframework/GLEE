"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $9,500 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have 10 rounds, there's time to see if Alice will come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm hoping for a price closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer for $8,750 is the best option. You're getting a good price, and you're still saving $1,250 compared to buying from John. There's always a chance Alice might counter with a lower offer, but it's not worth risking a higher price or losing time to potentially get a better deal."
