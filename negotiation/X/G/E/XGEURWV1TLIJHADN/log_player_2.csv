"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,000,000 is far beyond his budget, and he can get the product for $800,000 from John.  A counteroffer is the next logical step to try and get a better price from Alice."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for a lower price.  A counteroffer is a good strategy to try and close the gap further."

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
