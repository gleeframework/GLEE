"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer close to John's price of $1,000,000, but leaves a little room for negotiation. Offering $1,050,000 shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal, but is also willing to pay a little more than John's offer. This strategy creates a starting point for negotiation without immediately rejecting Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than John's offer, and Bob is determined to get the best deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer while still staying under John's price. This counteroffer of $1,100,000 shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating a good deal, but also that he is willing to pay a bit more than his previous offer. This strategy aims to keep the negotiations moving forward and hopefully lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to her original offer, and it's becoming clear that she is not willing to go much lower.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This ensures a lower price and avoids further negotiation with Alice, which may not yield a significantly better price."
