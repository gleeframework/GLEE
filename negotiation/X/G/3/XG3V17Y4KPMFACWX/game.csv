"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to me.  While I agree this product would be beneficial, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, given the true value of this product and the benefits it offers, $700,000 is significantly below what I had in mind. I'm willing to be flexible, but I have to be realistic.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $750,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $750,000 is closer to what you're looking for, it's still a substantial difference from what I consider fair value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $825,000. This feels like a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I can sense we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
