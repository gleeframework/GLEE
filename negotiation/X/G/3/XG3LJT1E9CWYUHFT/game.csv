"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a win. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50. That way, we both get a good deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  How about $109?  It's a fair price that considers both of our positions. Let's close this deal and move on.",109.0,Alice,5,
