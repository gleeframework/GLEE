"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly tone can build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Openness:**  Mentioning openness to negotiation shows flexibility and signals a willingness to compromise. 
* **Intrigue:**  The phrase ""amazing product"" is intended to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much information. 

**Important Note:** I'm aware that I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $150, but I'm trying to maximize my profit. Starting high and being willing to negotiate allows me to potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I have 9 more rounds and the option to sell to John for the same amount.  
* **Potential for More:** There's a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob. I need to find a price that's higher than $150, but still reasonable enough that Bob might be willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is just a little too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $175 to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Midpoint:** $175 is a midpoint between my initial offer of $200 and Bob's offer of $150. This might be a good compromise point.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm suggesting that $175 is my final offer to make Bob feel some urgency to close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response in round 4 to determine my next move. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll need to decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions, I believe $160 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $160 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left to negotiate. Time is running out.
* **Better Than John:** Even though I could sell to John for $150, Bob's offer is slightly better, and I'm not sure if I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $160. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome considering the limited time and the possibility of a lower price if I continue negotiating."
