"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, my budget is limited to $6000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $6000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $7500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7500. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, this time at $8500. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a final price of $8000 for the product. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price given our previous discussions and the value it holds for me.",8000.0,Bob,6,
