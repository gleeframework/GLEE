Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it by mentioning ""its value."" This subtly implies that the asking price is justified.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
