{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He can do better by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start by making a significant counteroffer to show Alice he's serious about negotiating. Offering $1,050,000 is a good starting point, as it's still significantly lower than Alice's initial price but leaves room for further negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,080,000 is getting closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate further. There are still rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1060000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his ideal price without risking Alice walking away. Offering $1,060,000 is a compromise -  it's a small increase from his previous offer, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway, but still leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and Alice's offer is starting to get closer to his maximum budget.  While there's still potential to negotiate further, the risk of not getting a deal is high.  Buying from John guarantees the product at his maximum budget, ensuring he doesn't overspend."
