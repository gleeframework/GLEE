Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my guaranteed minimum value of $1,000,000, giving me room to negotiate. 
* It's also a psychologically appealing number - it's a round figure and leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 

**The Strategy:**

By offering a higher price, I'm aiming to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob values the product highly, I can potentially get a better price than my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Start negotiations:** This higher price allows for a negotiation process. Bob might counter-offer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so there's a risk he'll reject the offer. 
* I'm willing to accept the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, but I'm hoping to achieve a higher price by negotiating with Bob."
