{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $180 when you can get the product for $150 from John. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer of $130.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to my target price."

``` 

While $165 is closer to my target price, I can still try to get it lower. Rejecting the offer gives me another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer to $145, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my target."

``` 

It's still not worth it to accept Alice's offer at $160. I'm close to my target price, but I can still try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $148.  I'm getting closer to Alice's price, but still hoping to save a few dollars."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $155 is getting closer to my target price, I'm still within my 10 rounds and can try to negotiate a bit lower.  There's always a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and I don't want to miss out on that opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 152}
```

This is my final attempt to get a price lower than John's offer.  I'm getting close to Alice's price, but still hoping to save a couple of dollars."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

There's only one round left and Alice is not budging.  I've reached the limit of my negotiation and it's better to buy from John at $150 to avoid potentially losing out on the product entirely."
