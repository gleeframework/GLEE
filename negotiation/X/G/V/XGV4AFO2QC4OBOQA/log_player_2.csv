"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality, and I know you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping to negotiate a lower price and save some money.  I'm not going to buy from John yet, as I can likely get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This should open up the negotiation and encourage her to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too high for me. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a lower price. I'm not going to buy from John yet as I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is closer to what I want, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $85.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? "", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a middle ground price between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal.  $87.50 is a good compromise and might be acceptable for Alice."
