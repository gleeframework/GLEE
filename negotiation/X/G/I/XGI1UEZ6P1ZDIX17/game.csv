"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  I'm proposing $1,100,000.  This still leaves a good amount of value for both of us, and allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
