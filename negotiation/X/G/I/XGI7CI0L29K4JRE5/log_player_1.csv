Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  At $11,500, you are still getting a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still go down a little if Bob counteroffers, but you're not giving away the farm. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  You're not starting at a ridiculous price, suggesting you're open to a deal. 

Remember, you can always go to John for $12,000 if you feel you're not getting a good enough deal from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is too low, as it is below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While you could accept and make a small profit, you can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

You will need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  You can consider:

* **A small counter-offer:**  Perhaps offer $10,500 or $11,000, showing you are willing to compromise but still aiming for a higher price.
* **A more aggressive counter-offer:**  You could try a counteroffer closer to your original $11,500, but be prepared for Bob to potentially walk away.

Remember, you can always go to John for $12,000 if you reach a stalemate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I need to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still represents a great value for you, and I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows that you are willing to negotiate but are still holding firm on your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** You've explained why this price still represents a good value for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Openness:** You've ended with a statement expressing hope for a deal, creating a sense of positive momentum. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move that allows you to potentially secure a better price than Bob's initial offer while remaining open to negotiation."
