"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Confidence:** The message conveys a sense of confidence in the product's value and sets the stage for a positive negotiation.
* **Openness:**  The message invites Bob to engage in discussion, rather than simply presenting a hard-line offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would you consider $12000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While I could sell to John for $15,000, there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.  I have 8 rounds left, and by rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is simply too low for this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($20,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Direct and Clear:** My message is clear and concise, leaving no room for misinterpretation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within a tight budget. Could you consider $15000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum acceptable value.
* **No further room:** I don't believe I can get a better price from Bob, especially since he already offered my minimum. 
* **Risk of losing deal:**  If I reject his offer, he might back out completely, leaving me with only the $15,000 offer from John. It's better to secure the deal now."
