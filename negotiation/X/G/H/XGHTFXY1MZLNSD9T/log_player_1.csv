"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's in great condition and worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's quality and personal value to me can make the price seem more justified. 
* **Negotiation Signal:**  The ""willing to negotiate"" statement signals flexibility and openness to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. The product looks great, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Even though Bob rejected my first offer, he's shown interest in the product. There's a chance he might be willing to pay closer to my desired price if I counter with a slightly lower offer.
* **Negotiation is key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Round Strategy:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, perhaps $125. I'll also emphasize the value of the product and the opportunity for a good deal for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  This product is in great condition and has a lot of value. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get your money's worth."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $135 to $125, showing willingness to negotiate. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's a step closer to his range.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm framing $125 as a ""fair price for both of us,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Positive Tone:**  ""Get your money's worth"" is a positive phrase that aims to encourage Bob to see the value in the deal."
