Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $145, which is above Bob's value of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the offer as a ""great deal.""
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer.

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept the offer.  However, if he doesn't, I'm prepared to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  My minimum acceptable price is $150. While Bob's offer of $130 is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my threshold.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested in the product and has demonstrated a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. 

I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 137.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. 
* **Appeal to fairness:**  The message frames the offer as being ""fair for both of us,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintain value:**  The price of $137.50 is still significantly above Bob's initial valuation of $120, but it's also closer to my desired price point.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable price for me. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer and avoid the need to go through further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further price reductions, and I'm not confident that I can reach my desired price point.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $150, eliminating the uncertainty and potential for further concessions in the negotiation with Bob.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of further price reductions outweighs the potential benefit of continued negotiation. Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit and allows me to move on."
