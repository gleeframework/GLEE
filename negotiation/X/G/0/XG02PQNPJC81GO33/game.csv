"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $9,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,750, which is a significant compromise for me.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250,  meeting you halfway. This would be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $9,250 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,750. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. ",8750.0,Bob,6,
