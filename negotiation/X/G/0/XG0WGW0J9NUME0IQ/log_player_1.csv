"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above Bob's value but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value of $120 as possible, but I also want to keep the negotiation open to avoid losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price, especially since Bob has already shown some willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility while also keeping the negotiation moving towards a more favorable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $98 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I want to see if I can get Bob to go a bit higher. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price.  I also want to avoid rushing into a deal, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $120 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm going to counter with $102. This is another compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's previous offer and my minimum value. I'm hoping that this time, Bob will accept and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiations have stalled, and Bob's offer is getting further from my minimum value. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value of $120, which is more than I'm likely to get from Bob at this point."
