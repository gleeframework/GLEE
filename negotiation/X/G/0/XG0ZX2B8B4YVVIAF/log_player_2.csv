Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $900,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still a significant gap from where I see the product's value. I'm willing to consider a final offer from my side: $850,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth.
