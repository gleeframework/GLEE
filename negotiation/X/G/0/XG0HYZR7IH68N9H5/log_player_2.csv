# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its high value to you at $15,000, I propose we strike a deal that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair profit for me. I am offering the product to you for $14,000. This price not only allows you to acquire an asset valued at $15,000 but also secures a significant saving compared to the market rate. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to facilitate this transaction. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $14,000
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $15,000
* **John's price:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John at a higher price makes accepting her initial offer the most logical choice."
