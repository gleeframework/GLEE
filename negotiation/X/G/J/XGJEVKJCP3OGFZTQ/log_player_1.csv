Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if the price goes down. 
* **Confident Demeanor:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value, which might make Bob more receptive to a higher price.
* **Safety Net:** Remember, you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000. This knowledge gives you a strong position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my interest. While I value the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below your minimum of $12,000. It's worthwhile to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target price. You have leverage since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its true value. To make this work, I could come down to $13,000. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You've lowered your price, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate.
* **Smaller Concession:** The price drop is significant but keeps you firmly above your $12,000 minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Reiterate Value:**  You're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping to justify your counteroffer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""better deal elsewhere"" might encourage Bob to act sooner rather than risk losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. If we can find common ground there, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, he's still significantly below your $12,000 minimum.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's acceptable to you, especially since he mentioned ""exploring other options."" You have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, ensuring you don't lose any potential profit. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and take the sure thing."
