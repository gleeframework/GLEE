"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my interest. While I value the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its true value. To make this work, I could come down to $13,000. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. If we can find common ground there, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,
