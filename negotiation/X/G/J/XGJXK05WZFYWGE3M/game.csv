"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After careful thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,5,
