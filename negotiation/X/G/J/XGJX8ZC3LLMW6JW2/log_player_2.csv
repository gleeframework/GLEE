"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's valued at $150 for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal, you can likely do better. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice values the product at $120. This leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $130. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to your target price.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely or getting stuck with John's higher price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a decent price within your budget."
