Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows me to see if Bob values the product highly.
* **Strategic Backup:**  By having John as a backup buyer, I can end the negotiation with Bob if his counteroffers become too low. This ensures I'll never sell the product for less than $1,000,000.
* **Uncertainty:** Since I don't know Bob's value, starting high is a good tactic to test the waters. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 shows he values the product.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm rejecting his offer because I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially push Bob to offer closer to my target. 

I'll now make a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to go higher. If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good price. If he rejects, I can either make another counteroffer or walk away and sell to John.
* **Maintaining Control:**  By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation dynamic and keep the possibility of achieving a better price alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is relatively close to my desired price range and significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating and try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal completely and having to settle for John's offer is too high.
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation might take more time and energy, and it's not guaranteed to yield a significantly better outcome.

At this point, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible choice, maximizing my earnings with minimal risk."
