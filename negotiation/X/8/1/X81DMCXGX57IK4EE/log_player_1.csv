Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly reminding Bob that it's worth a significant amount, potentially even more than he initially thought. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's ""thoughts""  signals that you're open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable figure.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
