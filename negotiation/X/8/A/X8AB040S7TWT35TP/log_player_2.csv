Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your $10,000 limit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a lower price. You have several rounds left, so there's time to explore a deal closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $13,000 is still a little too high for me.  Would you consider $11,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,500.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $12,500 is still above your budget of $10,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk you won't reach a deal and will end up with nothing.  It's wiser to take the guaranteed option of buying from John for $10,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and saves you the potential for further negotiation rounds."
