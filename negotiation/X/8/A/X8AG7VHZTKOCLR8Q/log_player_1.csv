Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price higher than $80 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Avoid Overpricing:**  If you start too high (e.g., $115 or more), Bob is more likely to reject the offer outright, leading you to the $80 sale to John."
