Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a price that's higher than what the product is worth to me, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to counter his offers if needed, or to sell to John if it becomes clear that I won't be able to get a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $18,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him, but I'm prepared to go back and forth a bit more if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,500. While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, it's a fair offer and it's getting close to what I'm hoping to earn.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob, or losing out completely by choosing to sell to John."
