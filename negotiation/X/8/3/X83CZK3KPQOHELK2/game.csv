"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique and lucrative investment opportunity for you.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still give you a decent profit and allow me to make a worthwhile investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe the product's value to you is worth the investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
