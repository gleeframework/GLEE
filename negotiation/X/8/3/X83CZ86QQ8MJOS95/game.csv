"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to drop to $10,875. This would allow us to both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. Let me know what you think.",10875.0,Alice,5,
