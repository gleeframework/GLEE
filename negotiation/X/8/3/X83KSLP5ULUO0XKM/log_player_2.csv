"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This product is worth more to Alice than it is to me. I can get it for much cheaper from John, so I'm going to reject Alice's offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is my top price, as I can purchase the same product from John for that amount."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is quite low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not willing to go that high. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that's closer to our respective values, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you a price of $11,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our values, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to go that high.  It's a good offer, but it's not quite in my budget yet. I'm going to try one more counteroffer, but I'm ready to buy from John if this doesn't work."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $11,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I'm getting closer to Alice's price, but it's still a little too high for me. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer. He's offering a price that's within my budget and will save me a considerable amount compared to what Alice is offering."
