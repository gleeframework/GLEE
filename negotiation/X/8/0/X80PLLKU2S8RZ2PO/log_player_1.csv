Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price,  while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to John's offer ($80) would leave too much potential profit on the table. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of a higher sale price."
