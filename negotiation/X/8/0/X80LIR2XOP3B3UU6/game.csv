"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe holds significant value for your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the unique benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the market value.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the value it brings while recognizing your budget considerations.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $1,275,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
