"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $140. It's much better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with my maximum price, $100, as that's what the product is worth to me.  Let's see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is closer to my maximum price, it's still a bit high.  I'm going to try to get a lower price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $105, which is halfway between Alice's last offer and my maximum price.  Hopefully this is a good compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my maximum price, I am still determined to get the best possible deal. I am going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 107}
``` 

I'm offering $107, which is a small increase from my previous offer but still lower than Alice's.  With only a few rounds left, hopefully this is enough to convince Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice is not budging.  I've already rejected several offers, and with only a few rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get the price down to my target.  To avoid risking further negotiation, I'll buy the product from John for $100."
