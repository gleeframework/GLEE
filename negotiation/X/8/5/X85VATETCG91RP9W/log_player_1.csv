Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested.  It's worth pushing a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

}
```

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has hit a significant psychological threshold at $1,000,000. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $200,000 over John's offer.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting bogged down and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
