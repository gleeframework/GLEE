"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.",10000.0,Alice,3,
