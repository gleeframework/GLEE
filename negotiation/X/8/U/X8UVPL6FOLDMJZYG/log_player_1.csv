"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, knowing I have the option of selling to John for $10,000 if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum threshold, $7,500 is still too low. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to try and get a price closer to my desired $10,000.  However, if this round doesn't yield a more acceptable offer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,500 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best offer you're going to get. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
