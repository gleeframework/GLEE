"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $850,000. Let's see if we can work together to find a price that suits us both.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with $825,000 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Let's say I'll include a free maintenance package worth $20,000. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some extra support to get you started. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
