Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000), leaving room for negotiation.**
* **It's below the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000), giving him incentive to accept.**
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.**

By setting a higher initial price, you are establishing a starting point for negotiation and allowing room for concessions while still earning a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have room to negotiate further, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product.  By rejecting his offer, you can send a counteroffer closer to your initial asking price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to move from your initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Offers a compromise:** By splitting the difference, it seems fair and less confrontational.
* **Keeps the price above your minimum acceptable price:** $1,100,000 is still a significant profit for you.

By proposing a compromise and keeping the price higher than your minimum, you continue to leverage your position while showing a willingness to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant profit for me, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether. Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate, but there's no guarantee he'll continue to come up in price. Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss, making this offer the most beneficial option."
