"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, there's a good chance I can negotiate a lower price with Alice. Starting at $1,200,000 leaves me room to bargain before reaching my maximum budget of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've started by countering with a significantly lower price than Alice's offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price well below her initial offer and my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but I think there's still some wiggle room.  It's worth another counter-offer to see if I can push the price a bit lower before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm inching closer to Alice's counter-offer while still staying under my budget. This offer puts the ball back in her court and gives her a chance to accept a price that's beneficial for both of us."
