Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 to make this a worthwhile deal."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that should be more acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? That's my final offer."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she's not budging much more on price. Her ""final offer"" of $11,500 is still above your maximum budget and significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in you getting a better price than you can get from John right now."
