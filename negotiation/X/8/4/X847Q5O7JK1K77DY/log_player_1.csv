Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that's slightly higher than its value to him. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than the product's value to me, but it's still a decent offer. Since I'm trying to earn as much as I can, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $11,000, which is higher than his offer but still lower than the product's value to me. This way, I'm trying to find a middle ground that benefits both parties.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than the product's value to me, but it's getting closer. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000, I'll reject Bob's offer again and send a new counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $12,500, which is a bit higher than his offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
