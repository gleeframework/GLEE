"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. My asking price is $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
This initial offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $110 is higher than your minimum value of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $110 is lower than Bob's maximum value of $120, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It allows room for negotiation:** Both you and Bob have space to adjust the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is above my minimum, it's still significantly below my initial offer of $110. I'm confident I can secure a higher price through further negotiation.  There are still 8 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not going to go below $105. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum of $80 and closer to my desired price than his previous offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $105, accepting this offer ensures a successful deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation. With only 6 rounds remaining, it's a good time to secure a solid price."
