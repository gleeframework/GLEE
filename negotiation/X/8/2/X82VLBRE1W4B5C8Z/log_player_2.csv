{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $120 is a good price, but I can try to get it for even less. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This will give me some room to negotiate in the following rounds."

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $110, which is a reasonable price considering my initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer means getting a good deal while still staying within my budget."
