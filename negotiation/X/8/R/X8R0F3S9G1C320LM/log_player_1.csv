Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a high starting point, making it more likely that you'll get closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum valuation of $1,500,000. I believe I can push for a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm reducing my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a significant profit. This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price point that is still valuable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum valuation, and further negotiation seems unlikely to get me closer to my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
