{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get the price down to my maximum limit.  There's still potential to save some money, and I'm not yet willing to pay more than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still staying below Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates that I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm also sticking to my budget constraints.  I believe this offer has a good chance of being accepted by Alice, but if not, I'm ready to buy from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's getting closer, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get her down to my desired price.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 ensures I get the product at the best possible price within my budget."
