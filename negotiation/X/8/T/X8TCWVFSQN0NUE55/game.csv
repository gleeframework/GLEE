"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $975,000? That would be a fair compromise, I believe.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is a tough ask for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
