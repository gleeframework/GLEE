# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product's value. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is a tough ask for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000 and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best possible price."
