"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value and the market price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product is worth that to you, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,000. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price is fair and allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know if this works for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $11,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",11750.0,Bob,6,
