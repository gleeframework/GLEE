Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer. I'll try to get as close to $800,000 as possible.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This offer still reflects the true value of what I'm offering.
