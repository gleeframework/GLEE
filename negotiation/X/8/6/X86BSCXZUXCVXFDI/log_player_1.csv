"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $115, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** Keeping a friendly and positive tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving space for counteroffer:** By asking ""what do you think?"", I acknowledge the possibility of a counteroffer and encourage Bob to participate actively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even lower than Bob's perceived value of $100. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. There's potential for a deal at a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Opportunity to increase price:** I can use the next round to make a counteroffer and potentially drive the price higher.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:**  $105 is a midpoint between my minimum acceptable price ($120) and Bob's offer ($85),  making it a reasonable compromise. 
* **Appeal to fairness:** I've emphasized ""fair deal"" and ""value of the product"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and justify my price.
* **Open to further discussion:**  Ending with ""Let me know what you think"" keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That seems fair to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $95 is still below my ideal price, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:**  We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer is a good way to secure a sale.
* **Potential for higher offers:** While I could try for a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up further, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** If the deal with Bob falls through, I can still sell to John for $120. This gives me a safety net.

**Overall:**  Accepting this offer is a good compromise that balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal."
