Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do it for $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $6,500 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $10,000?  It's a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,000 is still a bit much, how about $7,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are still significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
