Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $18,000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 1% discount, so the price would be $17,800. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.

Round 9

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,160

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000.  There's only one round left, and Alice is still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk is too high that they won't reach an agreement and he'll be left with nothing. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his desired price."
