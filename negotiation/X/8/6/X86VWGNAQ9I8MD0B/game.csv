"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $16,000.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $17,000? This would give us both a fair deal.",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we say $18,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's a bit more than your last offer.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $17,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",17500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $18,000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 1% discount, so the price would be $17,800. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.",17800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount offer, but $17,800 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $17,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to make a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $17,200, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'll throw in another concession: I'll give you a 2% discount, so the price would be $17,160. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal here.",17160.0,Alice,9,
