Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. How does $12,000 sound?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's worth it for me at that price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is too low for me, even though it's a good deal for him. I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point of $12,000. I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down a little more to $10,250. That's a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,800 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $10,000. I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more in the next round.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet because I think I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. Let's settle on $10,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to save some money, so I'll go up to $9,500. That's my last offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Bob isn't willing to budge from $9,500, and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely, so I'm going to sell to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than nothing."
