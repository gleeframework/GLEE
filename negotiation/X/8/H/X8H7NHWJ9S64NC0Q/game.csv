"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $7,000 for the product. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $7,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $12,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering $9,500 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
