"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $6,000. Would you consider that?",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?"
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, you're getting closer.  How about $6,800?  That's a fair offer.",6800.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $6,800 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can do $8,000, which is my absolute minimum. Can you consider that?"
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I really need to get at least $8,500 out of this deal. Can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Alice,5,,
