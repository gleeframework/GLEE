"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is quite steep.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair offer considering its features and benefits.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget. Could we agree on $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $7,000 is still below its true value, I'm prepared to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? This offer reflects my desire to close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to move on the price.  I appreciate that.  To make this work for me, I need to be closer to $8,000.  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle this at $11,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and the value it will bring you.",11000.0,Alice,7,
