"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $15000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12000 is closer, I'm still limited by my budget of $8000. Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $9000? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is getting closer, I'm still limited by my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a deal, but $10000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500.
