Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.
