"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $10,000? That's a significant offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, and I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  To be honest, $10,000 is too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal.  Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, my absolute limit is $11,000.  If you're okay with that, we have a deal. If not, I completely understand, but I might have to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself as well. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500? That's my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,7,
