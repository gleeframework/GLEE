You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $150 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $120, and it's her ""final offer"".  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $100."
