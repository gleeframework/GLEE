"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",12800.0,Bob,4,
