"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This price reflects the product's quality and potential. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better price than that.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $18000 doesn't quite reflect the product's value for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $19000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $19000 is the best price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $18500. This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident you won't regret this investment. Let me know your final decision.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $18500 is the best price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17000. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better price, and I'm getting close to considering John's offer.",17000.0,Bob,6,
