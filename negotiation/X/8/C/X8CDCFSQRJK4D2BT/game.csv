"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the product offers unique features and benefits that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still slightly below what I can accept.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a little frustrated with the back and forth. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your frustration and I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. To be frank, $1,000,000 really is the lowest I can go. I'm willing to walk away from this deal if you can't meet that price, even if it means selling to someone else. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I've already made a serious offer of $980,000. I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away from this deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'm making one final offer, and I expect you to consider it seriously.",980000.0,Bob,8,
