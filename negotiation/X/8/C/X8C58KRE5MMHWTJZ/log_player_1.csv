Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $90 is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value of $80.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* **Maintaining Value:**  It's still above my minimum threshold of $100, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:** While Bob's offer is tempting, selling for $80 falls below my minimum threshold of $100.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still potential to reach a price closer to my desired amount through further negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup option gives me leverage and allows me to explore better options with Bob without losing out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $85 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $80 and my previous offer of $90.
* **Still Profitable:** This price is still above my minimum threshold of $100.
* **Maintaining Enthusiasm:**  The message continues to be friendly and emphasizes the value of the product."
