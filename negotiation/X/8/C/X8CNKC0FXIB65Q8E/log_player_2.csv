"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are only willing to spend $8,000, and Alice's offer is more than double that. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** This is your safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she has lowered the price, it's still significantly above your budget.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  
* **Buying from John is still your fallback option.**  You can always go to John if you don't reach a deal with Alice.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer with a price closer to your budget, but not so low that it's insulting to Alice.  A counteroffer around $9,000 might be a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but that's still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $9,500. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's a step down from her previous offers, it's still significantly more than your budget allows.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You have 5 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise further. 
* **Buying from John is still your fallback option.** If you don't reach a deal with Alice, you can always secure the product from John for a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer with a price closer to your budget, aiming for a price in the $10,000-$11,000 range. It's important to be firm but respectful in your counteroffer, showing Alice that you're serious about acquiring the product but are also sticking to your financial limitations."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still above what I can comfortably spend. I'm truly interested in this product and willing to pay $11,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Although she's shown a willingness to compromise, $13,500 is still outside of your budget.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have 3 rounds left, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate further. 
* **Buying from John is still your fallback option.** This ensures you have a guaranteed deal if you can't reach an agreement with Alice.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer with a price that's closer to your budget and her minimum price. Aim for a price between $12,000 and $12,500.  You can emphasize your genuine interest in the product and your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but  $13,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,500, which is a significant step up from my last offer.  I believe this price is fair considering our previous negotiations and the value you place on the product.  Let's close this deal and make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,250. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Even though it's her final compromise, $14,250 is still significantly more than what you're willing to spend.
* **You have only one round left.**  There's not enough time to negotiate further and risk losing the deal.
* **Buying from John guarantees you a lower price.** This is the most financially sensible option at this point.  

You've successfully negotiated with Alice, but you've reached a point where it's more advantageous to secure the product at a fixed price from John, despite it not being your ideal price."
