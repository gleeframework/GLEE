"I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but that's still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $9,500. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still above what I can comfortably spend. I'm truly interested in this product and willing to pay $11,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let's find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is my best compromise so far, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but  $13,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,500, which is a significant step up from my last offer.  I believe this price is fair considering our previous negotiations and the value you place on the product.  Let's close this deal and make this work for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,250. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",14250.0,Alice,9,
