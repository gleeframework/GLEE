"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: 
* The product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price. 
* Buying from John right now is too expensive, and there's a chance to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

Reasoning:

* This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still above what the product is worth to Alice. 
* This counteroffer allows for potential negotiation while keeping the price below your maximum limit of $120. 
* The message is friendly and open to negotiation, leaving room for Alice to counter back."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $110. How about $102.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning: 

* Alice's offer is still above my desired price range. 
* It's better to continue negotiating to potentially get a lower price.
* Buying from John now would be more expensive than potentially getting a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $98.75? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 98.75}
```

Reasoning:

* This counteroffer is still below Alice's offer, showing a continued willingness to negotiate. 
* The offer is closer to Alice's previous offer, signaling a desire to reach an agreement.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the mutual benefit of reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet in the middle between $98.75 and $102.50? That would be $100.625, but I can round down to $100.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

* Alice's offer of $100.50 is within my budget of $120 and closer to my desired price range. 
* It is likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly lower price.
* Buying from John at $120 would be more expensive and unnecessary at this point."
