Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I need to make a significant profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than $700,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make a profit. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While Bob is showing interest, his offers aren't moving close enough to the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the sure deal with John."
