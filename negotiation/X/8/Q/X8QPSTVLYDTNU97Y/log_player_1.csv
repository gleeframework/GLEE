Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" provides a vague but potentially compelling reason for the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price higher than your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial limits or negotiation style. In a real-world scenario, researching your potential buyer is crucial.
* **Relationship Building:**  A softer approach might be beneficial for long-term business relationships.  Consider if maximizing immediate profit outweighs potential future interactions with Bob."
