"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly below my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired value, I believe I can still get closer to $1,000,000 by continuing negotiations.  I'm not in a rush, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price considering the value he'll get from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if I need to, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $935,000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but I'm also putting some pressure on Bob by mentioning the possibility of selling to another buyer.  This might make him more inclined to accept a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but $935,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm running out of rounds and the risk of not getting a better deal is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and I won't have to risk continuing the negotiation."
