Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $100, accepting Bob's offer at $90 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum value of $80 and selling to John for $80 would mean I'm leaving $10 on the table."
