Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $15,000 offer gives Bob the impression the product is highly valued while leaving space for him to counter-offer. This increases the chance of a sale above my minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value without revealing my true bottom line."
