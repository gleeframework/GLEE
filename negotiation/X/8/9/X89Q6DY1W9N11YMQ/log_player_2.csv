"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still above your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for a much lower price."
