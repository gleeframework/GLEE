"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While $140 is within your budget, it leaves little room for negotiation and potential savings.
* **There's potential for a better deal.** Since you're willing to spend up to $150, there's room to negotiate a lower price with Alice.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You know John is willing to sell for $150, so you have a fallback if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $142 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she's moved slightly from her initial price, it's still above my ideal price point. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating. 
* **John remains a backup option.** The option to buy from John for $150 ensures I won't be stuck with a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $142 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $139, which is a bit lower than my last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $139. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $139
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but still not there.** While $139 is better than her previous offer, it's still above my ideal price of $135.
* **I have room to negotiate further.** I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price if I continue to push for a better deal.
* **John remains a safe backup.**  Knowing John will sell for $150 gives me the flexibility to walk away if negotiations with Alice don't yield a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $139 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $135, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $135 and $139, which is $137. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting close to my target.** $137 is only $2 above my ideal price of $135. 
* **Further negotiation might be fruitless.**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and pushing for a lower price might risk losing the deal. 
* **Saving $13 is significant.** While I would prefer to pay $135, saving $13 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial asking price and from John's price."
