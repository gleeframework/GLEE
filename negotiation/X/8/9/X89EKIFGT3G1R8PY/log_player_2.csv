"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll love it and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a better price or proceed with John's offer and save a considerable amount."
