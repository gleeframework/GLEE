"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a great deal considering the value of the product for you. Let's find a way to make this work!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it ensures I can still make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're really making this tough!  I can do $12,000, but that's really pushing my budget.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,6,
