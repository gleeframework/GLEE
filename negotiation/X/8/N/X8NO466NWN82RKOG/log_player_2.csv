"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a great deal considering the value of the product for you. Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'd accept. There's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
 

We're splitting the difference here to try and find a compromise while still leaving room to negotiate upwards a little if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it ensures I can still make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I'd consider, but I think there's still a little wiggle room before I accept or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're really making this tough!  I can do $12,000, but that's really pushing my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

This counteroffer puts us at Alice's value for the product. It's a strong offer, and she may accept. If she rejects it, we'll have to seriously consider John's offer in the next round as we're running out of rounds to negotiate."
