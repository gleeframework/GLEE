I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'm not ready to accept $10,750 yet. I want to see if I can negotiate a price closer to $11,000."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $10,875. I'm willing to pay $10,750, but I'd like to make it a bit more competitive for you. How about we meet at $10,750, but I'll throw in an additional $200 for shipping and handling? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,000, the offer of $10,750 plus the $200 for shipping is a good deal.  It's within my minimum range of $10,000, and the added shipping cost is a nice bonus. I'll take it!"
