{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.  I can offer you $90.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $90 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $95? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's try to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy the product from John. While Alice has come down to $95, you've only got a couple of rounds left and there's no guarantee she'll budge further. You're also risking getting locked into a price that's still higher than John's.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal."
