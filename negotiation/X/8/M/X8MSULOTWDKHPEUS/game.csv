"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000. This is a fair offer considering its benefits to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $13,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
