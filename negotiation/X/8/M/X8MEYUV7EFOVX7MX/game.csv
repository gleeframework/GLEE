"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll experience.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $887,500? This allows me to get closer to my initial target, and still provides you with a great deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $887,500, but I'm still just a bit too high for my comfort zone. Let's split the difference and settle at $881,250. This way we both get a bit closer to what we want, and we can close this deal.",881250.0,Bob,6,
