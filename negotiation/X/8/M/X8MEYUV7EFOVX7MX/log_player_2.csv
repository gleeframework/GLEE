"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is too high.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get closer to my asking price. Would you consider $900,000? This product has immense potential and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $900,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price point. There's still room to negotiate, and Bob can try to push for a lower price. Buying from John at $1,000,000 would be a worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $887,500? This allows me to get closer to my initial target, and still provides you with a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $887,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, Bob can still try to negotiate further. He's already made it clear that he's willing to pay around $875,000, so there's room to push for a slightly lower price. Buying from John for $1,000,000 would be a much worse deal, so Bob should continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $887,500, but I'm still just a bit too high for my comfort zone. Let's split the difference and settle at $881,250. This way we both get a bit closer to what we want, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 881250}
