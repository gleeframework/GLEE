"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's even more valuable to you. My initial price is $1,150,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I know we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm looking to make a smart investment. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think we can do better than $1,150,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going below $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,150,000. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about we try $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
