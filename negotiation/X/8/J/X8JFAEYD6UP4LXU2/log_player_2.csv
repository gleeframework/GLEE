Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going below $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
