"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would you consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product offers significant value, and I believe this price reflects that.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you meet me in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $12,000 is closer, I'm targeting a price closer to $15,000. How about we settle at $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I do appreciate you working with me on the price. However, that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $10,000?  That's a significant amount and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",10000.0,Bob,6,
