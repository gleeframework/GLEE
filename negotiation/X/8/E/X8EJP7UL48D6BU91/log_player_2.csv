"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $600000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you ($600,000 vs. $800,000). You have room to negotiate and aim for a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $600,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** This counteroffer is a significant step up from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value and compromise:** The message emphasizes your understanding of the product's value while also suggesting a compromise to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Setting the stage for future negotiations:** This counteroffer opens the door for further discussion and potential adjustments in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $725000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is getting closer to your ideal price, and it's significantly better than John's offer of $800,000.  While there's still room to negotiate, accepting this offer saves you $75,000 and secures the product.  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely, especially as you're already halfway through the rounds."
