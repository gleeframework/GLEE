"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a high initial price to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Fair offer:**  $120 is still a good value for Bob, as he values the product at $150. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and optimistic tone helps encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $120 is not my absolute bottom line, leaving space for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value over profit:** While $100 is better than $80, it's still significantly less than what I could potentially earn. 
* **Negotiation power:** Bob has already shown interest in the product, so I have some leverage in this negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can propose a counteroffer that might be more favorable to me.  

I'm confident that I can potentially secure a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justified offer:**  $110 still leaves significant profit for me while remaining attractive to Bob.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Clear next step:** I explicitly ask for Bob's response to help move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob has moved closer to my price point, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for improvement:**  I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.

I'm confident that I can find a price that is more beneficial to me by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested and we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $108, but I can't go any lower. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to meet you halfway. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession to show flexibility, but still keeping a significant profit margin.
* **Final offer implication:**  By stating ""I can't go any lower,"" I'm subtly indicating this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob. 
* **Focus on fairness:**  I emphasize ""good price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Clear call to action:**  I ask for Bob's response to push the negotiation forward and see if we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to the lowest price as possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $107? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob has made a significant concession from his previous offer, bringing us very close to a deal.
* **Limited potential:**  It's unlikely that I can secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting the offer ensures a sale, reducing the risk of Bob backing out entirely or the negotiation stalling.  

While $107 is not ideal, it's a solid profit and a good outcome considering the limited time remaining."
