"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with this price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum value and what John offers. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to establish room for negotiation and signal that her first price was unrealistic. 
* **Justification:** Offering a brief explanation keeps the negotiation polite and suggests a willingness to find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Target:** Aiming for around $800,000 gives us space to potentially meet in the middle if Alice is unwilling to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial price, $1,200,000 is still significantly more than John's offer. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This would be a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to the midpoint between our previous offer and Alice's counteroffer to signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Stronger Justification:** Emphasizing that $950,000 is a ""significant investment"" adds weight to our counteroffer and shows we're serious about purchasing, but not at any cost.
* **Leaving Room:** We're still leaving some space for potential negotiation if Alice isn't willing to accept this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to move significantly from $1,100,000.  While we might be able to negotiate her down a bit further, it's unlikely to be enough to make it worthwhile.  John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000. It makes more financial sense to take the sure deal with John at this point rather than risk a stalemate with Alice."
