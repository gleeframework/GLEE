"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's still significantly lower than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me to make it seem like a good deal for Bob.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, but also encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I want to earn.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I have John as a backup option. This gives me leverage to push for a better price. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still remaining above Bob's offer. 
* **Focus on value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth,  making my price seem reasonable.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price. There's no point in risking a lower price with Bob when I have a guaranteed higher price elsewhere.
* **Time is running out:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to make a decisive move to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $10,500. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last chance:** This is my final offer before I consider selling to John. I'm demonstrating a commitment to closing the deal with Bob, but also setting a firm boundary.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise to show good faith, but still securing a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price for both of us, creating a sense of mutual benefit."
