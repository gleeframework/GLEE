# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see tremendous value from it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this opportunity.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a substantial discount from my initial offer.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the potential value you'll realize.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
