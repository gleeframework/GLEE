Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this opportunity.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a substantial discount from my initial offer.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the potential value you'll realize.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still quite interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $900,000.  While I'd prefer more, it's a fair price and we're both getting closer to our desired outcomes.  It's better to close the deal now than risk losing him and having to settle with John for less."
