"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see tremendous value from it. I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the significant benefits you'll receive. Let's discuss further!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this opportunity.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a substantial discount from my initial offer.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the potential value you'll realize.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still quite interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,4,
