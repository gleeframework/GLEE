"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction for a product worth much more to me.  It's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a price that's still below its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential savings you'd get from selling it quickly. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still allows me to make a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This would provide you with a substantial profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential for a quick sale.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value your persistence and appreciate your offer.  However, $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the opportunity for a quick sale.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
