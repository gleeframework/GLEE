{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also stating my confidence in the product's value to him, hoping to increase his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $8,500.  This is still a bit above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum price and signals a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. Would you consider selling it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a bit more, $8,250 is above my minimum acceptable price and a decent compromise.  It's also worth noting that if I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing him completely and potentially having to settle for John's $8,000 offer."
