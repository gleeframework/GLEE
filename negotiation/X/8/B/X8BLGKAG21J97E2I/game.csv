"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it's the highest I can go at this moment.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,100,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
