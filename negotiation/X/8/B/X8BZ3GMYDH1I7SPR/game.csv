"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth a bit more than your counteroffer. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a revised counteroffer of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise further if necessary.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
