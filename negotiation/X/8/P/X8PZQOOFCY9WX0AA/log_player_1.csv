Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also a decent starting point, as it leaves me with a profit margin of $10."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is still above Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate. It also leaves me with a decent profit margin and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, his offer of $85 is too low. It falls below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  To ensure I make a profit, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
