"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it gives me the opportunity to get the product without overspending."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still try to negotiate a lower price, or he can buy from John for a lower price.  While $1,300,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

At this point, Alice's offer is still higher than what John is willing to sell for, and there's a risk that further negotiation with Alice might not lead to a better price.  It's best to secure the product from John for a guaranteed lower price."
