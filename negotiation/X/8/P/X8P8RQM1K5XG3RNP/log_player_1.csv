Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Giving Bob some room to negotiate makes him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some wiggle room if Bob counter-offers.
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** By making a concrete offer, you're signaling that you're ready to negotiate.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to secure a sale, I'm not desperate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counter-offer that's more in line with my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value of the product for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:** My counter-offer of $1,050,000 is a significant step towards Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a reasonable price:** This counter-offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** My message clarifies that while I'm open to further discussion, $1,050,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds significant value for you.  How about we settle on $975,000? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $975,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $1,012,500. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, but it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:**  I'm not giving up yet.  By making a counter-offer, I show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Meeting in the middle:** My offer is a compromise, meeting halfway between our last offers.  This shows a willingness to find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Setting a clear limit:** I reiterate that this is my lowest price,  giving Bob a clear understanding of my position. 

This counter-offer leaves room for further negotiation while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle this at an even $1,000,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still falls short. I've been willing to negotiate and compromise, but at this point, I'm confident that I can get a better price from John.  I've been through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not seeing much room for Bob to increase his offer further. Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit, and it's the most strategic decision in this situation."
