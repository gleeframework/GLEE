Alice's offer:

I'll sell it to you for $14,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,500. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. It's better to secure the product from John at the known price of $12,000 than risk further negotiation with Alice."
