"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob has room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

Bob is offering $8,500, which is a significant drop from Alice's offer but still slightly above Bob's maximum budget. This allows room for negotiation, and Bob can still afford to pay a bit more if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Even though it's lower than her original offer, it doesn't make sense for Bob to continue negotiating and risk Alice walking away or potentially making a counteroffer closer to her initial asking price.  John offers the product for Bob's maximum budget, and it's a safe and guaranteed option."
