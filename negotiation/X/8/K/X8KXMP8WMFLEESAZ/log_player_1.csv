I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a high price, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay it. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a compromise from my initial price and is still a good deal for both of us. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay it."
