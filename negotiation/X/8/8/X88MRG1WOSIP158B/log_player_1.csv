Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Considering its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product for $1,100,000 creates a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") and positions it as a good deal for Bob (saving him $100,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. We can potentially settle at a price higher than $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
