Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100?"",

``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:Start with a counteroffer significantly lower than my maximum budget, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a much lower price while still being able to negotiate upwards if needed."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! However, $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
