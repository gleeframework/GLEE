"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique and valuable. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. Let me know what you think!",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $600,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me while still giving you a decent profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
