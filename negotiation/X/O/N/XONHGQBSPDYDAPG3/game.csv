"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  I believe this is still a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find some common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work, but I can't go any higher. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 still isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be at least $1,350,000 for this to work. Let's get closer to finding a solution that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to bridge the gap and offer $1,300,000. This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that will allow us to both walk away satisfied. Let's reach a deal in these final rounds.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
