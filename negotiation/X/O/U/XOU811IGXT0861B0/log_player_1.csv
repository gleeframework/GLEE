Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a good initial discount from his perceived value while still getting me a decent profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,500 is still a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and  gets me closer to my target. It's also possible that further negotiation with Bob would result in a lower price.  Selling to John would only net me $10,000, so accepting this offer from Bob is the best course of action."
