"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'm starting with the lowest possible offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a strong opening position, and hopefully, we can reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to pay more than $1,000,000 unless it's absolutely necessary.  I'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,500,000.  This shows she's willing to negotiate. I'm increasing my offer by $100,000 to show I'm also willing to compromise. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to her, and we can finalize a deal."
