Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very slowly coming down in price, and it's unlikely we'll get her much lower than $10,000.  Buying from John for $10,000 ensures we don't overpay and risk exceeding our budget."
