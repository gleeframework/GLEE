Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. In light of our ongoing dialogue, I would like to propose an adjusted price of $1350000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still slightly above your budget.  While you could continue to negotiate, you're now only two rounds away from having to accept John's offer. It's becoming riskier to keep rejecting Alice's offers, as you might end up paying more than John's price.  

At this point, it's wiser to secure the product from John for $1,200,000. This ensures you get the product at a price within your budget and avoids the risk of Alice's next offer potentially being even higher."
