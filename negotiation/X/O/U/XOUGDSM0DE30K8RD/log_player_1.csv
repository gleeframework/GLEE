Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for your needs, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks great, $22,000 is way beyond my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. This product has a lot of value and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefit.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $7,000, but that's my absolute limit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $7,000 is too low.  Would you be willing to consider $15,000?  That's a significant price drop and reflects my strong desire to find a solution for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to meet the minimum price of $15,000.  He's made slow progress in his offers and we're getting close to the halfway point in negotiations. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
