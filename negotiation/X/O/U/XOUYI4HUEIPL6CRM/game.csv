"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I appreciate the offer, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, and I think that's a fair price given my budget and the value I'm getting.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can offer you a compromise at $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9800.0,Alice,5,
