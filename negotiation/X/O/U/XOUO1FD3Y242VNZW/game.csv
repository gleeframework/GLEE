"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's below its market value. Consider this a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Please let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
