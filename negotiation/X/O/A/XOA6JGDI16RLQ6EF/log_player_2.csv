"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,000**.  This is less than your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Buying from John costs $10,000**.  This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice as it saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
