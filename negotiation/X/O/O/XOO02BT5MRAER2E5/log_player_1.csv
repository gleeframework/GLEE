Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'll only accept offers at or below this price.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  I've received significant interest, but I believe you'd benefit greatly from it. I'm offering it to you at a premium price of $1,450,000. Let me know if you'd like to move forward."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's exclusivity and value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,450,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while staying well above your minimum. 
* **Confidence:** By mentioning other interested parties, you signal the product's desirability.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great price!
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. Depending on his offer, you can either negotiate further or politely decline knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000.

**Important:**  This is just one offer strategy. You can adjust the price and messaging based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
