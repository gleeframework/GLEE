"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is capped at $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $2,000,000 represents the high-end of this product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
