Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good chance of making a profit. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth selling the product to him for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hopefully pushing Bob closer to my target price."
