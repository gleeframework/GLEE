Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoned Justification:** I'm providing a justification for the price to make it seem reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to hearing his counteroffer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:**  While $1,000,000 is less than my minimum, it's a good starting point. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This offer will give me a sense of how strongly Bob wants the product. 
* **Maintain Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his reaction. 

Ultimately, the goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum ($1,200,000) as possible, while still remaining open to negotiation and considering John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am able to pay $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price, considering Bob's interest and the value of the product.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my minimum, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if his counteroffers continue to be below my minimum, I will proceed to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is still below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above his initial proposal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm  not going below my minimum price yet. This demonstrates my commitment to securing a profitable deal. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate while also stressing the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm signaling my willingness to compromise.  This increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement. However, I'm still holding firm on a price that is closer to my minimum, ensuring I can still achieve a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I am only able to offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you place on it and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $975,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $225,000 lower than what I'd like to get. 
* **Limited Upward Negotiation:**  It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly further, given his budget constraints.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher and provides a secure and guaranteed outcome.

**Conclusion:**

It's more beneficial to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of getting stuck with a lower price from Bob is too high."
