"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That would still leave you with a good deal, and I wouldn't have to lower my price too much.",120.0,Alice,3,
