"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a good deal for both of us, as the product is worth a lot more to you. Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you at that price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
