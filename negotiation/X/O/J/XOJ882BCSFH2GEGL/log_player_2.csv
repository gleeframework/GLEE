"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above his ideal price point.  He can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but it's still a bit higher than Alice's minimum. This shows he's serious about buying the product, but is also trying to get a good deal. He's leaving room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a good deal for both of us, as the product is worth a lot more to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's target, he can still potentially get a better price. He's only had two rounds, and there's still room to negotiate further.  It's worth continuing to try and push Alice down closer to his $10,500 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you at that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing flexibility by meeting Alice halfway. This demonstrates his commitment to closing the deal while still trying to get the best possible price.  He's aiming for a price that's fair to both parties, which could help encourage Alice to accept."
