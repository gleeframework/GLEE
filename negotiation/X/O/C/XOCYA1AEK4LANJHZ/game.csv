"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to keep my expenses in check. Can you consider my counteroffer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to keep costs down, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference at $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
