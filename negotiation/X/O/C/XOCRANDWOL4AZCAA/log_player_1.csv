Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm willing to sell it to you for $95.  It's worth a lot more than that to you, and this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, as that's within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90. However, I'm still stuck at $85. This product is great, but I need to stick to my budget. If you can meet me at $85, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $85.  While I wanted to get closer to $90, it's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  $85 is a good price, and I'm happy with the outcome."
