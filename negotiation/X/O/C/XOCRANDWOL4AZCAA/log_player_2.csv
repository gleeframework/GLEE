"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm willing to sell it to you for $95.  It's worth a lot more than that to you, and this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $100.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds and can always buy from John if you don't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, as that's within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** My counteroffer starts by dropping the price to $85, which is $10 lower than Alice's offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise. 
* **Positive tone:**  I use a positive tone to avoid alienating Alice. 
* **Budget justification:** I mention that $85 is within my budget, subtly implying that I won't go higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $90 is still above my target of $80.  I can continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. It's worth exploring if I can get even closer to my goal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90. However, I'm still stuck at $85. This product is great, but I need to stick to my budget. If you can meet me at $85, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterate your budget:** I emphasize my budget constraint again, reinforcing that I won't go higher than $85.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** I acknowledge Alice's compromise and express my willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Mention alternative options:** I hint at considering other options if she doesn't accept my offer, putting pressure on Alice. 
* **Stay firm on your price:** I don't budge from my target price of $85."
