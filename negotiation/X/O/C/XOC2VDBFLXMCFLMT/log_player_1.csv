"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to me! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value. This allows for negotiation space without sacrificing too much.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the perceived value to Bob by mentioning the $10,000 worth to me. This subtly reinforces the deal's attractiveness.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a friendly tone, inviting Bob to counter-offer and keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,800 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a more favorable price. I'll counter-offer in the next round to try and find a middle ground. 
* **John as a safety net:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have John as a backup option to ensure I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,800 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,150?  That way, we both get a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,800). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  I emphasize ""splitting the difference"" to position my offer as fair and reasonable.
* **Maintaining Open Communication:** I end with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $8,600 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my bottom line.
* **Exploring Further Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to find a compromise that's more favorable to me. I'll counter-offer in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup option, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer just to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,600 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's the best I can do.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to settle for a drastically low price.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that this is the best I can do to signal that I'm nearing my limit.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to Compromise:**  I reiterate my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're at round 6, meaning only 4 rounds remain. The negotiation is taking longer than expected, and I'm concerned about the time constraint. 
* **Offer Still Too Low:** $8,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable value, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.  
* **John is a Sure Thing:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at $10,000.  Selling to him now is the most logical choice to secure a good price and avoid potential further losses."
