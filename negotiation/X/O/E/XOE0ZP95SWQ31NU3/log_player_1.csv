I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong initial baseline and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It's important to start high because I don't know Bob's value for the product, and I want to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $500,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $850,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this price is a fair compromise, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $650,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $750,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, and I hope it will be attractive enough for him to accept.  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal $800,000, but I'm willing to be flexible to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price, Bob's persistent lowball offers and the fact that we've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation suggest that we are unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable price.  John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, making this the best option for me at this time."
