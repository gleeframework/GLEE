"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
