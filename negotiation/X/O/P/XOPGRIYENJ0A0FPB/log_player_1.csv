Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counters. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's benefit to Bob without revealing your own minimum price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a public listing subtly introduces a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act faster.

**Important Note:** Even though John offers $15,000, aiming higher with Bob is strategic.  There's a chance Bob might accept the $20,000, earning Alice a higher profit."
