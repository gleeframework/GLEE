You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $10,000."
