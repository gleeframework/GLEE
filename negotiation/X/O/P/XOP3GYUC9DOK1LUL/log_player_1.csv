Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,500. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This creates room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely implies the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, you have a buffer to negotiate down while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, you could adjust the initial offer."
