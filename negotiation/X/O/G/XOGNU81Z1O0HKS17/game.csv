"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it has immense value for your business as well. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  It's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is a good price, I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price still allows for a good profit for me and a reasonable investment for you.  Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $1,000,000? This would allow us to reach an agreement that is acceptable for both parties.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
