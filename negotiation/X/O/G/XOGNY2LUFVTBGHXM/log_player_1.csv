"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit more.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price above my minimum.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer of $115 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $100. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
