"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $120 from John. Since Alice's offer is $100, there's room for negotiation. You can attempt to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to get the best price possible. Since you know John is willing to sell it for $120, you can offer a price that's closer to your ideal price but still leaves room for Alice to negotiate. $90 is a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still lower than John's price of $120, and it's closer to your ideal price. While there's still room for negotiation, there's a chance that Alice won't budge further. It's better to accept the offer now and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price or losing the deal with Alice altogether."
