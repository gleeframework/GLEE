"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's too early to buy from John, as I might be able to get a better price from Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively low counteroffer, as it's likely Alice will need to come down from her initial price.  I'm aiming for a significant discount, but not so low that it's immediately rejected.  I want to see how much she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still too high for me.  While it's closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product but still pushing for a lower price.  $11,500 is a good middle ground between our previous offers.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - $13,000, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $13,000 is still above my comfort zone. I have a few rounds left and still have the option of buying from John at $12,000, so I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm close to my limit but I can't go higher than $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our negotiations so far.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better price than what John is offering.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept. If not, I might have to resort to buying from John in the next round."
