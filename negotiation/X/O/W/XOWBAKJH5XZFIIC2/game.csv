,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - $13,000, and we have a deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm close to my limit but I can't go higher than $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our negotiations so far.  Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
