"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still well above your estimated value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $750,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for the offer.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. Let's see if we can agree on that.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to consider a slightly higher offer, but I'm not going to go any lower than $850,000. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional features that will increase the product's value even more. If you're willing to meet me at $850,000, I'll include these extra features and make it a very attractive offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm trying to be fair. However, I'm not comfortable going above $800,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,6,
