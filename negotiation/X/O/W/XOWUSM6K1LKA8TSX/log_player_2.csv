"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is too high.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's definitely room for negotiation. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $750,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $850,000 is still higher than where you want to be. There's still room to negotiate and get a better price. You're still within your budget, so rejecting this offer and counter-offering again is the best option."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for the offer.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. Let's see if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to consider a slightly higher offer, but I'm not going to go any lower than $850,000. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional features that will increase the product's value even more. If you're willing to meet me at $850,000, I'll include these extra features and make it a very attractive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering additional features, it's important to remember that your primary goal is to save money. The additional features might be nice, but you're still within your budget and can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue trying to get a price closer to your ideal $800,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm trying to be fair. However, I'm not comfortable going above $800,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 800000}
