"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is enticing, it's still above her estimated value of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  By rejecting, Bob can potentially secure a lower price closer to Alice's valuation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get the price down, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still above Alice's valuation of $1,200,000, ensuring both parties are happy with the deal. Accepting this offer saves Bob a significant amount of money."
