Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident this product could bring you significant value, I can't let it go for less than $1,800,000.  How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Perhaps a price closer to $1,100,000 would be more agreeable?

How about we settle at $1,600,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your initial investment."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the highest I can justify. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Bob has made it clear he won't go above $1,200,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000. It makes the most financial sense to sell to John at this point."
