"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident this product could bring you significant value, I can't let it go for less than $1,800,000.  How about we meet in the middle?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Perhaps a price closer to $1,100,000 would be more agreeable?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,100,000 is just too low. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your initial investment.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the highest I can justify.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
