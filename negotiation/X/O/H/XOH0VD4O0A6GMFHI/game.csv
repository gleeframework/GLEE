"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  What about $1,080,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,080,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is my final offer.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $1,060,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $1,070,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this now.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
