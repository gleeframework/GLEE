Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,150,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let's talk. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to start by trying to negotiate a better price.  While $1,150,000 is close to my limit, I'm not going to jump at the first offer.  There's a good chance I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  What about $1,080,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still closer to my target price with John. I'll see if I can get Alice to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,080,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $1,060,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $1,070,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I can still buy it from John for a lower price, this is the best deal I'm likely to get from Alice. It's worth accepting her offer and closing this deal."
