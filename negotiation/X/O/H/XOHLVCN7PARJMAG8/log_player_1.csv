"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my minimum value. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate downwards while still securing a good profit. It's important to remember that John is a backup option at $1,200,000, so I'm willing to negotiate to some extent to see if I can get closer to that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly, showing flexibility but still maintaining a strong position. $1,050,000 is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's interest while keeping me significantly above my minimum value. This strategy aims to encourage Bob to consider accepting the offer while keeping the negotiation within a desirable range for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe I can secure a better deal with more negotiation. My minimum value is $1,200,000, and I have a guaranteed sale at that price with John.  I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation to see if I can close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again, but still staying above my minimum value.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, while also demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell.  I'm betting that with only 5 rounds left, Bob will be more motivated to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can secure a price closer to $1,000,000.  My backup option with John guarantees me $1,200,000, so I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is on him to make a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final attempt to close a deal with Bob. I'm offering a price that's just below my previous offer but still significantly higher than Bob's latest offer.  This move signals that I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I'm not willing to go much lower. With only three rounds left, Bob will have to decide if he wants to accept my offer or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal is increasing. It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000. This ensures a higher profit and avoids the potential of losing out completely."
