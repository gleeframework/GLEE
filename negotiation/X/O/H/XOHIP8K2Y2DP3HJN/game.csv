"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet at $108? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $108 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",109.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $109. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if you're willing to meet me at that price.",107.0,Bob,6,
