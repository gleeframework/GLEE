I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. I hope you will consider this offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900000 is enough to cover the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $950000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",950000.0,Alice,5,
