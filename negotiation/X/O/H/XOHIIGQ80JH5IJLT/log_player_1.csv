Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,350,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently offering prices significantly below our minimum ($1,500,000). His latest offer of $1,350,000 indicates he's unlikely to meet our needs.  It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds and potentially ending up with an even lower offer. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price."
