"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate you being willing to sell me this product. However, $120 is a bit above what I'm willing to spend right now. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for that price.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go too low. How about we meet in the middle again at $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to sell it to you for that amount.",102.5,Alice,5,
