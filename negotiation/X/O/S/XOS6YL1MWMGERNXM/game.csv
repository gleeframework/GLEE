"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. This product holds value for me, but closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,800,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $1,800,000 is still out of my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to be realistic about the price. How about $1,250,000? I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. If you're willing to meet me at $1,600,000, we have a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. I'm hopeful we can find an agreement that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
