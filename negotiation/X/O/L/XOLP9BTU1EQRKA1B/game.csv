"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective.  $9,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. ",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, I encourage you to accept. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",11000.0,Alice,5,
