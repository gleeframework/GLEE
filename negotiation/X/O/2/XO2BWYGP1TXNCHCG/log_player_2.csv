"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,300,000.  Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,200,000.  There's room to negotiate and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also demonstrating your seriousness about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point and what you believe you can get through continued negotiation.  There's still room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's still below Alice's latest offer and closer to your desired price point, making it a potentially acceptable middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting too close to John's price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better price, and the risk of Alice rejecting any further counteroffers is high. It's more efficient to just buy from John and avoid the continued back-and-forth."
