Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is slightly below my minimum but high enough to potentially entice Bob while still yielding a significant profit.
* **Sense of Exclusivity:** By mentioning a ""special price"" and potential public listing, I create a sense of urgency and value. 

This approach balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, I earn more. If he rejects it, I still have my guaranteed sale to John."
