"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to make sure I can make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $65, so I'll offer you the product for $82.50.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you finding a middle ground Alice.  However, my budget is a hard $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you the product for $85. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",85.0,Alice,5,
