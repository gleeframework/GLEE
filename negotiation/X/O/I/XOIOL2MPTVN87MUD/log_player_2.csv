Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you the product for $85. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and you have a guaranteed option at $80 from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
