"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I could consider a price closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a fair deal. However, your offer significantly undervalues the product's potential. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a significant adjustment that reflects my desire to close a deal, but it also acknowledges the true value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant gap from where I'm at. To be frank, I'm targeting something closer to $1,250,000.  If that's not workable, I might have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value this product brings to your business justifies a higher price.  Let's meet in the middle – how about $1,750,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true worth of what's on offer.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $1,400,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this final push – $1,600,000, and we have a deal. This price truly reflects the value you're gaining and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're close.  However, that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  My final offer is $1,450,000.  Let me know if that works for you - otherwise, I think we've reached the limit of what I can do.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
