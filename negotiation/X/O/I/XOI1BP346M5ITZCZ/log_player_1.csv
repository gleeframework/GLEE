``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a decent price for you, and Bob should be willing to pay it given his value for the product. If he rejects it, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $6,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value it holds for you. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is a bit lower than I'd like, but it's still above my minimum of $8,000. I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
