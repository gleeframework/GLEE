"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counter-offer is:

* **Significantly lower than Alice's asking price:** This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Above Alice's own valuation:**  This ensures there's still a potential profit margin for Alice, making it more likely she'll consider the offer. 
* **Gives us room to negotiate:** I'm starting low, anticipating some back-and-forth before reaching a final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $6,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value it holds for you. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $9,000 is still a considerable markup from her $8,000 valuation. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a better compromise can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price, indicating I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Still below Alice's initial offer:** I'm holding firm on not paying an excessive markup.
* **Maintains a reasonable profit for Alice:** $7,500 is still a decent profit margin for her."
