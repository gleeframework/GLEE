"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you a healthy profit margin. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,250,000 is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me. This product is worth more, and I'm confident I can find a buyer who values it accordingly.  I'm willing to make one final concession,  $1,125,000. This is my absolute bottom line. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to other opportunities.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
