"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  To make this a swift deal, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above your budget of $10,000.  There's no reason to accept this offer. It's much better to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $22,000 is far above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still allows for potential negotiation. It demonstrates your interest in the product while establishing a clear price boundary.  $12,000 is a good starting point for negotiations, leaving room for both sides to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $12,000 is quite a ways off my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $18,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point of $10,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you have several rounds left and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. A counteroffer might lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  This is a fair price that we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. You've raised your offer from $12,000 to $15,000, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's a significant step closer to Alice's last offer, signaling that you're serious about buying the product but still within your budget. This could lead to a swift agreement."
