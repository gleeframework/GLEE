"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far below what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a fair profit, but $120 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a significant increase from my initial offer and should be a reasonable compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $105. This is a significant discount from my initial price and gives you a great opportunity to acquire a valuable product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $105 is closer to what I can afford, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $95? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While I'm willing to be flexible, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  How about $100? That's a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a reasonable deal.",100.0,Alice,7,
