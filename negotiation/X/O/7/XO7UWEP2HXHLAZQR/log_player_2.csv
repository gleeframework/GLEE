Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still above my budget. I want to try to get it lower before considering buying from John.  There are still rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can reasonably afford right now. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is close to my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $800,000. There is still a chance I can negotiate a lower price, but at this point, it's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it completely."
