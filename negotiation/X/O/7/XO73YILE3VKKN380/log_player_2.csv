"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you!  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good price, it's still above Bob's target of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. By offering $120, he's making a bold move, hoping to get a quicker agreement or at least push Alice to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $130 is within Bob's budget of $150.
* **Progress:** Alice has come down from $140 to $130, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up buying from John at a higher price.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures a good deal while minimizing the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
