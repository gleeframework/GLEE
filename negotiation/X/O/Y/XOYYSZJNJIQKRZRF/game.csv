"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
