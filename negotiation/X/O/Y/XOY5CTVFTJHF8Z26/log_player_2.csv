"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer of $160 is far above your maximum budget of $80 and even higher than her own valuation of the product. It makes sense to negotiate further, as there's a good chance of getting a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is quite steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider something closer to $60.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than my budget ($60 vs. $80), I aim to establish a negotiation anchor and gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message remains courteous while clearly conveying that the initial offer is unrealistic for me.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial counteroffer allows for back-and-forth negotiation, with the goal of ultimately reaching a price within my acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $110 is still significantly higher than both your budget ($80) and your previous counteroffer ($60).  There's room for further negotiation. Alice seems motivated to sell, indicated by her willingness to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we try $75? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer moves closer to my budget's upper limit while still leaving some room for potential compromise. 
* **Fairness Appeal:**  By framing the offer as ""fair,"" I aim to maintain a positive tone and encourage Alice to meet me closer to my price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is now closer to my walk-away point (buying from John for $80) while still potentially being attractive enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're still a bit far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $95, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $95 is still above your maximum budget of $80. You've tried negotiating, and further attempts are unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay.  At this point, it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John for $80."
