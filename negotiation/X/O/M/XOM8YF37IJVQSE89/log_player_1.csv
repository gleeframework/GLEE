{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is greater than your minimum value of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still go higher if Bob counters, but it's not too aggressive, allowing you to gauge his interest. 
* **It's a good compromise:**  While it's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, it's still attractive to him and gives you a chance to earn more than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the price, but I think we can work towards a more reasonable figure. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
