"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm very interested in the product, $12,000 is a little high for my budget. How about we bring the price down to $10,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $11,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable.  How about $10,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $11,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
