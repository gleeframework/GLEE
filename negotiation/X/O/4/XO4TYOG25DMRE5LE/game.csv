"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is my maximum price. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're aiming for $17,500, but I'm still limited to $15,000. To make progress, I'm willing to compromise at $16,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Bob,4,
