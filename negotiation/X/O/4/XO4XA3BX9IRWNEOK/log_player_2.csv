"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. This is a strong opening move that shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal. While $950,000 is likely lower than Alice's ideal price, it's still well within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation in the upcoming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,100,000 is still above Bob's desired price point.  He can likely still negotiate further and get a better deal.  There are still several rounds left, so it's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice her minimum acceptable price. This shows that he's willing to be flexible and make a deal, but also that he won't overpay. This counteroffer is likely to be accepted by Alice as it meets her minimum price, and Bob saves a significant amount compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and the current offer is very close to Bob's original counteroffer. At this point, further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but there is a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away.  Also, with only 5 rounds left,  the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high.  It's wiser for Bob to accept this offer and secure the deal."
