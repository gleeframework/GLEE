Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth to me. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.
