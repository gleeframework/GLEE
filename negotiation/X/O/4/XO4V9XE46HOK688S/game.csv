"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your budget, but $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our mutual interests.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking that $9500 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $10000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
