Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're not selling below your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  He knows the product is worth $10,000, so a price of $9,500 is likely appealing.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still go lower if necessary.

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, you increase the likelihood of a successful deal while still maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still a loss for you compared to what you initially aimed for.  You're in a strong position, as John is willing to pay your minimum.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to get a better price from him or move on to John without losing money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500?  That way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This offer shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Still above your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **Building a relationship:**  By being reasonable and willing to compromise, you're keeping the negotiation going and increasing the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too far apart from $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $8,250 is only $250 away from your minimum of $8,000. 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Bob is willing to meet you halfway, which demonstrates his commitment to a deal.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with a decent profit.

While you'd ideally want to get closer to $9,000, it's important to weigh the potential gain against the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise that allows you to secure a sale and move on."
