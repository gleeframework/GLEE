Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Leaving Value for Bob:** Offering the product for $130 still leaves Bob with a perceived gain of $20 ($150 value - $130 price). This makes it more enticing for him to accept.
* **Setting the Anchor:** By stating that you believe the product is worth $150 to Bob, you are anchoring his perception of the product's value. 

This is just the first offer, and depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your approach in subsequent rounds of negotiation."
