"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're looking for a bargain, and Alice's initial offer is above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob! However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is closer, but still above your budget. You can try to negotiate further and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to get closer to my target. I can do $8,600, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you've only got five rounds left. At this point, it's wiser to secure the product from John for $8,000. While you might be able to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll reach a price you're comfortable with within the remaining rounds."
