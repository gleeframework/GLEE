"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That way we both get a fair deal. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $7,500, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit.  Let's make this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,
