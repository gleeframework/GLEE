"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. However, I still think the product is worth more than $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still not quite there yet. How about $125? I'm getting closer to your price, and I think this is a fair compromise.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go below $135. I think the product's value is worth it. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but not that much. How about $132?",132.0,Alice,5,
