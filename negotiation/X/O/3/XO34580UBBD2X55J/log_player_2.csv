"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $20,000 when John offers the same product for $15,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above John's price, leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still higher than John's price. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as there's a chance Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

This counteroffer is a little closer to Alice's last offer, showing that you're willing to negotiate, but still lower than her price, leaving room for compromise while remaining below your maximum price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $16,500 is very close to your maximum price point of $15,000. It is still slightly more than John's price, but the difference is small enough to justify accepting the offer and closing the deal. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, especially as Alice has been progressively reducing her price."
