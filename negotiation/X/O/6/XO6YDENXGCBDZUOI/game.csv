"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference and do $8,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8,000 just yet. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,250. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
