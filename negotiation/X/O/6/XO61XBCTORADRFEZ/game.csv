"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9750.  If we can agree on that, we can close the deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $10200? It's a slight concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",10200.0,Alice,7,
