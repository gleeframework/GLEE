"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
