{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your maximum budget and more expensive than buying from John. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity for Alice to potentially propose a lower price or you can proceed to purchase from John at your preferred price."
