"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1400000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1350000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreeable solution.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up on the value of the product just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $1320000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
