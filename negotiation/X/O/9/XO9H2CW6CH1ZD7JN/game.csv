"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to own this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a healthy profit for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $850,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This price still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
