"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""value and potential"" of the product without being too specific. This leaves room for Bob to justify a higher price in his mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording implies that this is just an initial offer, and I'm open to discussing the price further. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

My strategy is to start high and gradually decrease my asking price, leaving room to negotiate while always staying above my minimum selling price. I will also carefully consider Bob's counteroffers and my alternative option (selling to John) to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above my minimum selling price ($1,200,000), but it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price.  I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, I can try to guide the negotiation closer to a price point that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value. Taking everything into account, I could come down to $1,500,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my asking price by $100,000, which shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** However, I'm not meeting Bob's offer entirely.  A $1,500,000 price point keeps me well above my minimum and allows for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes that this price is a considered decision that ""reflects the true worth"" and benefits, reinforcing the product's value in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for more, it's risky. Bob has stated this is his maximum, and further negotiation could lead to him walking away. Accepting now guarantees I make my minimum desired profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
