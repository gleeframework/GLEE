Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Ensure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down, the offer ensures a profit significantly higher than the $8,000 backup offer from John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, increasing the chances of a successful sale at a price that greatly benefits Alice."
