"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still leaves a good profit margin for me and allows for a fair price for you.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
