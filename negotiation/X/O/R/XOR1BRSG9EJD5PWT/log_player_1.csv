"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it reflects the fact that the product is worth at least $15,000 to me.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm dropping the price to $17,500. It's still above my minimum value, but shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to drop the price again to $16,000.  This is getting closer to John's offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept. I'm also hoping that if Bob rejects, he'll come back with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round. I'm getting a little nervous about John's offer, but I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm going down to $15,500, which is just a bit above John's offer. I think this is the most I can get from Bob. If he rejects, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and Bob isn't willing to budge much. I'm not comfortable with the risk of continuing and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer or not selling at all. It's time to take the safe route and sell to John for $15,000."
