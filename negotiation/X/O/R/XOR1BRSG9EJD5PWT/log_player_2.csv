{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is starting with a lowball offer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. He's offering $10,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within the realm of possibility. This counteroffer is a starting point, and Bob will be ready to adjust his offer depending on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,500 is closer to his budget than her initial offer, it is still higher than what he can get from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further, as he might be able to get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but he's still aiming for a price lower than John's. He's offering $13,000, which is a compromise between his initial offer and Alice's last offer. This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to meet her halfway."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He's already made several counteroffers and is confident that he can push Alice lower. The goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Bob is sticking to his strategy of slowly increasing his offer, but he's still leaving room for negotiation. Offering $14,000 shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is also unwilling to go too far above his target price. He's confident that he can get a better deal than Alice's previous offer, and he's willing to keep negotiating until he reaches a price that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to accept at this point, he's still only 3 rounds away from being able to buy from John for a lower price. There's a good chance he can still negotiate Alice down further, especially since he's been consistently making counteroffers. It's worth taking the risk to try and get a better price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

This counteroffer shows Alice that he's serious about closing the deal, but he's also not willing to give in to her demands."
