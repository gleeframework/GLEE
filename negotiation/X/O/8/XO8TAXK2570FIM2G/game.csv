"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000. This takes into account the unique benefits this product offers and its potential for future growth.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000.  This price would give us both a fair return on the investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can offer $920,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price?",920000.0,Bob,6,
