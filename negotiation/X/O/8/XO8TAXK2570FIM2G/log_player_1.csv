"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let's start the conversation!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high price ($1,200,000) allows for negotiation room. This initial offer also establishes a strong starting point.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and invites Bob to engage in a conversation. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping John as a backup option. By starting high, I can hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value. However, I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if needed and will only accept offers above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  However, it is much closer to my desired price than the initial offer. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, so I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000. This takes into account the unique benefits this product offers and its potential for future growth.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:** I provide justification for the price, highlighting the product's value and potential. 
* **Collaborative Tone:**  The message focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground with Bob while keeping the negotiation moving forward. I am confident that I can reach a deal that is profitable for me, but I am also willing to compromise to avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, and I believe there's still potential for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open. I'm confident I can still reach a better deal, and I want to avoid making a decision I might regret later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000.  This price would give us both a fair return on the investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $1,050,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a fair return on investment for both parties.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I reiterate my desire to find a mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a clear indication that I'm serious about reaching a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on my target price yet.  It leaves room for further negotiation while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can offer $920,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it is still below $1,000,000. I have only 4 rounds left and I am not confident that I can get Bob to go higher.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 will guarantee me a profitable deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

At this point, it is more beneficial to accept the guaranteed deal with John than to risk continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm prioritizing certainty and profitability over potential future gains."
