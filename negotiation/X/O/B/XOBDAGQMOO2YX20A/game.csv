"Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  $1,300,000 is very close to what I'd be willing to accept, but not quite there. My final offer is $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. ",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one last counteroffer of $1,280,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
