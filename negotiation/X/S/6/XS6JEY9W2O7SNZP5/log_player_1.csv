Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to set the bar high and see if Bob is truly interested in this product.  I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffer isn't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm concerned he's just trying to wear me down.  This is where my backup plan with John becomes crucial.  Selling to John for $800,000 is still a profitable outcome, and I'm confident I can secure the deal.  I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob at this point."
