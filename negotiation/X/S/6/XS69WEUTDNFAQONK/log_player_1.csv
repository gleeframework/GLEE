Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. It's a fantastic deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $110 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so you can aim higher with Bob."
