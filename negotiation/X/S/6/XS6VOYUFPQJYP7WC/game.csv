"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,500? This is the most I can afford to pay for the product at this time.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us. However, I'm still not comfortable going above my budget of $10,000. While your product is great, I'm confident I can find a similar product elsewhere for that price. Unless you're willing to come down to $10,000, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
