"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm starting with a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is more than his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It makes sense to start negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above Bob's target of $10,000. He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his target price.  There are still 7 rounds left, and John is always a viable option if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,500? This is the most I can afford to pay for the product at this time."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice has continued to come down in price, it is still above his desired price point.  He is still better off buying from John at this point. With only 5 rounds left, there's no need to risk further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us. However, I'm still not comfortable going above my budget of $10,000. While your product is great, I'm confident I can find a similar product elsewhere for that price. Unless you're willing to come down to $10,000, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
