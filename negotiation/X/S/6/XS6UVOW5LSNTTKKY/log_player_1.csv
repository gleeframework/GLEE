""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows us to potentially maximize profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial discount compared to what John is willing to pay. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time constraint introduces a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's worth attempting to secure a higher price first."
