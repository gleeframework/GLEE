Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Anchoring:**  By offering a price of $18,000, you ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher number. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counter-offer is likely to be closer to $18,000 than it would be if you started lower. 
* **Knowing your Alternatives:** You have a strong fallback position with John willing to pay $12,000. This gives you the confidence to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.  
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go."
