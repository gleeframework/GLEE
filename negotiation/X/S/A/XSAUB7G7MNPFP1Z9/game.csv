"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also being more in line with your budget.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $9,500? That would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
