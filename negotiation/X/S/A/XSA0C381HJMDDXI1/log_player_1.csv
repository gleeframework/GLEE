Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its unique benefits. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000,  Alice knows its worth much more to her. Starting with a high offer ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to her desired outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" and positions the offer as ""exclusive"" to entice Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion (""What are your thoughts?"") signaling Alice's willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

Alice is aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value closer to her own. By starting high, she increases the chances of:

1. **Bob accepting outright:**  If Bob is highly motivated or perceives additional value not factored into his initial assessment, he might accept.
2. **Negotiating down:** Even if Bob counters, the negotiation is likely to happen closer to Alice's desired price range, rather than Bob's initial valuation.

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at $1,000,000."
