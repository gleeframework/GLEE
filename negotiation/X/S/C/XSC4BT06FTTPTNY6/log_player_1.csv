Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob can still potentially make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's within his budget:** The offer is below the value Bob places on the product, making it likely he'll consider it. 

Remember, if Bob rejects, you can always adjust your offer or sell to John. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price.  I'll try to push for a bit more by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $9,500?  It's a fair compromise, and still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
