"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1000000. Can you consider this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional perks and support you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $975000 is still too low for me. I've already made concessions and added perks to the deal, and I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I'm counteroffering at $1075000, and this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
