"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $10000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and allow me to get closer to my desired price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This would be a final offer, and a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
