"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was still a bit high for you, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll give you a bit more room to negotiate. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

 Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500 and I can save money by buying from John for $10,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome for me."
