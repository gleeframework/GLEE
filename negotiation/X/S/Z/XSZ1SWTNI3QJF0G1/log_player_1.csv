Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $120 offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $100 helps set a price ceiling.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($119) leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still maximizing Alice's potential profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
