Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's higher than your minimum but lower than Bob's maximum to maximize your profit. This requires finding a balance between a tempting offer and potential negotiation room.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant profit above your minimum.  
* **No Justification:**  Avoid justifying the price unless Bob directly challenges it. This keeps the focus on the product's value.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $150,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have room to negotiate down slightly while staying above your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy.  You could adjust the price and message depending on your risk tolerance and how aggressively you want to negotiate."
