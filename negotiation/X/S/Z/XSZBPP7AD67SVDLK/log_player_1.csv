Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Time Value:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even with a slightly lower profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale with John."
