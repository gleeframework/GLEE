Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **It's a significant discount for Bob:**  He gets the product for $100,000 less than its value to him. 
* **It's a great profit for me:** I earn $400,000 more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters with a lower price, I can still negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

While I could offer a higher price, there's a risk Bob might reject it.  This offer strikes a balance that should be attractive to both of us."
