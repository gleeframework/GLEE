"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I'm sure you'll find to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your $1,200,000 limit, there's room for negotiation.  You know you have John as a backup option, so you can see if Alice is willing to go lower."
