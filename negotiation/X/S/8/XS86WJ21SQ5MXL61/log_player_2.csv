"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even though Alice is offering a deal that's less than the product's value to Bob, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  Bob can save $150,000 by buying from John."
