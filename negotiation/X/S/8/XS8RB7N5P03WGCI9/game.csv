"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me, and it still provides you with a substantial profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and a price that still allows you a good profit. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on this offer, but $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I can offer $1,110,000, which is a small step closer to your price. This demonstrates my serious commitment to acquiring the product, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",1110000.0,Bob,6,
