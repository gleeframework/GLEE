Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me, and it still provides you with a substantial profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and a price that still allows you a good profit. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on this offer, but $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I can offer $1,110,000, which is a small step closer to your price. This demonstrates my serious commitment to acquiring the product, and I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we're still above $1,100,000, Bob is incrementally increasing his offers. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowballing in later rounds or the negotiation stalling out completely.  This secures a substantial profit over John's offer."
