Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it is still higher than what he is willing to pay. He should continue to try to negotiate a lower price. He has room to negotiate since he can get the product for $10,000 from John."
