"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above his target of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to buy it for $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to work with you, $10500 is still a bit below my desired price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10750? This would still be a good deal for you and allow me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $10,750 is closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has a backup option with John for $10,000, so there's no pressure to accept Alice's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,600.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  While $10600 is a good offer, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Let's try $10650.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  Alice's offer of $10,650 is only $650 over Bob's target price of $10,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next offer, and he might end up having to buy from John for $10,000.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product and saves some money compared to buying from John."
