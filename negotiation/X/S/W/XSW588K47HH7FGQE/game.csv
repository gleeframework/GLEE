"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not quite there, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need a price that works for both of us.  To be honest, $8,000 is the highest I can go. If you're unable to meet that, I might have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
