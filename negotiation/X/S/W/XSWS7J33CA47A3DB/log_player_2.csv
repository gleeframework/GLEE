"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Since you're willing to pay up to $80, there's room for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You're still aiming for a price closer to your maximum.  Rejecting and counteroffering again gives you a chance to get closer to that $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $80. I'm really interested in the product and think we can close a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 80}
