You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $150. Alice's offer of $120 is still too high. You can try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still within your budget of $150, and it's closer to your desired price.  There's no guarantee you can get a lower price in another round, and you risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good deal for you, considering your maximum is $150 and you're getting it for less."
