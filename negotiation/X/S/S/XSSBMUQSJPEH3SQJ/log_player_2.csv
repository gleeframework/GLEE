Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $105.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100 than to continue haggling with Alice and potentially end up paying more."
