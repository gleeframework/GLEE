"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking to sell it to you for $20000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $18000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $17000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to pay $16500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, just like you suggested. I can do $16250, but that's as close to $16500 as I'm willing to go. Let's make a deal!",16250.0,Alice,7,
