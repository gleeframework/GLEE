Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while my asking price is $1,150,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that benefits us both. Would you be interested in discussing further?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a strong offer closer to your minimum price ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The slightly lower price ($1,150,000) leaves room for negotiation while still staying above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Encouraging Engagement:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and openness to discussion, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have a little time to negotiate with Bob.  If you need to sell the product immediately, offering a price closer to $1,200,000 would be wiser."
