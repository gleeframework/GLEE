,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $115 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $107. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",107.0,Bob,4,
