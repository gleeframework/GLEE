"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,000? That's still a great deal for a product that's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this happen.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $13,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $14,250.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is getting closer.  How about we settle at $14,000 even? That's a reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Bob,6,
