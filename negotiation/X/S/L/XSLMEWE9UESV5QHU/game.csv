"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1500000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1520000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
