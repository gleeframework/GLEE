Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. This allows for potential negotiation towards a price that's still above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  There are other valid approaches depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
