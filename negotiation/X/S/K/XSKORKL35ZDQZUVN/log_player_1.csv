Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $140, which is higher than my minimum but gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get at least $120 from John, so this gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to go below $120, which is the price I can get from John. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a decent price.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to go lower than $120.  Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for that price, it's the most sensible option."
