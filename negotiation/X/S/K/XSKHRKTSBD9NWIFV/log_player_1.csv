Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find invaluable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Opening with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a strong profit.
* **Show Confidence:** A firm initial offer suggests the product's worth and gives you leverage in the negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing you to walk away from offers below $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is good, it's still below my target price and leaves potential profit on the table.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not in a rush to accept the first counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,130,000.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and this price reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 1130000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Lowering the price by $20,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** This counteroffer stays above the midpoint between Bob's offer and my initial price, signaling I'm aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reinforces why my price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,110,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly set on a price around $1,110,000. While I could push for a slightly higher amount, the difference is becoming marginal. Accepting this offer secures a $110,000 profit, which is a significant return. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk prolonging negotiations and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
