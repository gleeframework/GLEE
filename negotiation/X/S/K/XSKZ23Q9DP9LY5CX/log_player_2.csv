Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product for $105. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $105.  Since you can get the product for $100 from John, it makes more sense to take that deal."
