"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise that still allows me to get a good price for the product while also being reasonable for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9000. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
