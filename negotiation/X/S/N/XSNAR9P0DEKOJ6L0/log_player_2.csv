"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You value the product at $1,200,000 and Alice is offering it at $1,000,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  John's price is your maximum, so you want to avoid that if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My initial counteroffer is $900,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $1,000,000 but still higher than her value of $800,000.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, leaving room for further negotiation while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying within my budget:** This price is well within my budget of $1,200,000, leaving me some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my counteroffer.**  Her offer of $950,000 is only $50,000 higher than my counteroffer of $900,000.
* **It's within my budget.** The price is still significantly lower than what I would pay John ($1,200,000).
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming.** There's a chance that further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price, and it could be time-consuming.

It's a good deal for me, considering my budget and the potential time wasted on further negotiation."
