Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, giving Bob some room to negotiate.  It also leaves room for potential counteroffers without risking too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I will reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my goal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my goal of earning a good price."
