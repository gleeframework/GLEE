Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. Bob has an incentive to accept, as it's still a good deal for him. If he rejects, you'll know how far you can push the price up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can potentially get more.  By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer and Bob's. It signals your willingness to negotiate but still leaves you with a profit greater than selling to John."
