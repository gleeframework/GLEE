"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes no sense to accept this offer. You know you can get a better deal, either by negotiating with Alice or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We start with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A very low offer will help us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Establish a lower anchor:** By starting low, we try to shift the negotiation in our favor. Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets a lower point of reference for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, $20,000 is closer to my bottom line for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down in price, but it's still above your ideal price and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation.  We'll continue to counter-offer in hopes of getting closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $15,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Moving closer but staying firm:** This counteroffer acknowledges Alice's concession while still aiming for a price below our maximum budget. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $11,500 positions us slightly above the midpoint between our previous offer ($10,000) and Alice's current offer ($15,000). This shows willingness to negotiate but also signals that we're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to be serious about this. I know this product is worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm not going to sell it for less than that. Let's make this happen - how about $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting very close to John's offer and might be getting impatient. We still have room to negotiate for a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate.  I am serious about buying, but I need to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  We're now matching John's offer and presenting it as our final price. This creates a sense of urgency and limits further back-and-forth.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a chance Alice might reject this, it's a calculated risk. We're at a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether.  If Alice rejects this, we can always buy from John."
