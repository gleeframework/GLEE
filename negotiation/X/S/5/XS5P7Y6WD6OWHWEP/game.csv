"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, $20,000 is closer to my bottom line for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $15,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to be serious about this. I know this product is worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm not going to sell it for less than that. Let's make this happen - how about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate.  I am serious about buying, but I need to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
