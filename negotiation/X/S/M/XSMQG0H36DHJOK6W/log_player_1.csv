Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $12,000. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still a decent price. I'll decide to reject his offer and send a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll counter with a price of $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's offer was lower than my initial price.
