Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential and worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its $1,000,000 value to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John provides a safety net of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit above John's offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob encourages him to seriously consider the offer, even at a premium price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone of the message implies willingness to discuss the price further, should Bob counter-offer."
