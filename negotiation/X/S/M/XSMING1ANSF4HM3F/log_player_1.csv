Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'm aware that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, but I'm hoping to leverage the fact that he might be willing to pay a bit more to secure the deal.  If he rejects this offer, we'll see how he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a profit closer to my desired amount. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might find acceptable, while still ensuring I earn a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,450,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent profit and closer to my minimum than John's offer.  It's risky to keep pushing, as I might lose Bob completely. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
