{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is a good compromise. It's a significant profit for me while leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it leaves some room for me to save. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $10,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,750? That way, we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 9750}
