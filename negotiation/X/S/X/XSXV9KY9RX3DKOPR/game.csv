"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given my understanding of the product's value and my budget constraints, I'd like to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits. I'm eager to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, my initial pricing reflects the significant long-term benefits and potential this product holds, which go beyond its immediate applications.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price is still reflective of its true worth and potential return on investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I acknowledge the potential of the product, $1,900,000 is still above my budget. To find a middle ground, I'd like to offer $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a potential return on investment. I'm committed to reaching an agreement, but this is the highest I can go.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.  While your offer is tempting, I believe this product has the potential to generate significantly more value in the long run.  I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,600,000, which I believe represents a fair deal considering its future potential. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
