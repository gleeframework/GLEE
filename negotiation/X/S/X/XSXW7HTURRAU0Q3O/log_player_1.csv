Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $180. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to get a price closer to your desired range.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than the asking price, making the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is clear and concise, making it easy for Bob to understand the offer.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! You make a profit of $30 above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You can then decide if you want to lower the price slightly. You still have John as a backup to ensure you get at least $150.
* **Bob Rejects:**  No problem! You sell it to John for your minimum price."
