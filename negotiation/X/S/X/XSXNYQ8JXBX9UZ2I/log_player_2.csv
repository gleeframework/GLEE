"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it still allows for some room for negotiation.  This price is also well within your budget, and a good starting point for a bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it is lower than her initial price, it's still outside of my ideal budget.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's desired price of $10,000, while still remaining within my budget and leaving some room for compromise. It shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to be fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $1,000 more than what I'm willing to pay.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will take a lot of time, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price. 

John is offering the product for my desired price of $10,000, so it's the most efficient option to avoid further negotiation and simply purchase from him."
