"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially setting the price at $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($10,000) and what John is offering ($10,000).  You have a strong alternative with John, so there's no need to accept an overpriced offer. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to a better deal."
