Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's a bit below what the product is worth to Bob, but gives room for negotiation while still ensuring you earn more than your minimum acceptable price.  It's also a good place to start because it lets you assess Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally get closer to $9,500,  accepting Bob's offer at $9,000 is the best choice. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and keeps the deal moving forward.  Selling to John would mean earning less, and rejecting Bob's offer creates uncertainty and risks losing him as a buyer entirely."
