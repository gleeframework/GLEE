Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  To be fair to both of us, let's aim for a final price - $12,750. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,000, and you have a guaranteed option with John at that price.  You've negotiated well, but sometimes the best deals are made by knowing when to walk away."
