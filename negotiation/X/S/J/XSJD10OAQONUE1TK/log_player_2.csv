"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $25,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to consider my costs and the value I've attached to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm thinking of a price of $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is still too high. While it is a reduction from the initial offer, it's still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $20,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $15,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for and the current market rate."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob. However, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $22000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is still above my maximum budget of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems Alice is not willing to come down to a price that is acceptable to me. With only five rounds left, it's not likely I can get her to lower her price. To avoid losing more time and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll buy it from John for $15,000."
