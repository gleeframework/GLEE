"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $25000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob. However, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $22000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,5,
