"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer because you can get the product from John for a price that is only $5 more than Alice's offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $145 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm looking for something closer to $140. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer again. While $140 is a better price than her first offer, it's still closer to John's price than your ideal price. You can likely negotiate further with Alice to get a lower price, or you can always buy from John for a slightly higher price."
