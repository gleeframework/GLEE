Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $16,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500?

Bob's offer:

While Bob is negotiating, it's clear he's not going to reach my minimum price. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to haggle with Bob."
