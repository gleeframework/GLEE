"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that you think it's worth a serious offer. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $900000, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for a product of this value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm willing to pay $920000, which is a bit lower than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $915000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I believe this price reflects the product's true value. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price and make it a win-win for both of us.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $915000, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $910000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $915000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think this is the lowest price I can accept without losing money on the deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need you to meet me at $912500. This is my final offer.",912500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $910000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",910000.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $912500, Bob. I've already compromised a lot and I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm not going to sell the product for $910000, it's not worth it for me. I'm willing to sell it to John for $1000000, so I'd rather do that than sell it to you for a lower price.",912500.0,Alice,11,
