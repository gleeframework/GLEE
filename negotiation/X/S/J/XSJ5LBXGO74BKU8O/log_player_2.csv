"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000, so he should start by offering that amount. This gives Alice the opportunity to accept and allows Bob to get the product at his maximum price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  There is still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible, but he needs to be realistic about the potential for Alice to accept. Offering $1,300,000 represents a significant reduction from Alice's last offer and is a step closer to Bob's maximum.  This compromise could potentially incentivize Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer to his maximum budget.  Considering that there are only 5 rounds left, it's a good time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the negotiation ending without a deal.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation might not outweigh the risk of losing the deal altogether."
