"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if he's willing to play ball.  If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not going to accept it. While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I think I can still squeeze out a better deal with Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's perceived value, but closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping to get a deal close to my minimum in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to budge a little more.  While selling to John is always an option, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but still have some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to secure a deal with Bob in this round. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
