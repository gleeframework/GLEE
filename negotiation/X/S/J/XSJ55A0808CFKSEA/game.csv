"Bob, I believe this product has tremendous potential for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its value and gives you a good starting point for your investment.  Let's work together to make this a win-win situation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000,  which still offers you a significant return on investment. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit further.  I'm going to offer $950,000. This represents a good compromise and allows us to both make a profit on this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I believe is a fair value for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $975,000. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I'm confident it represents a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this transaction and move forward.",975000.0,Alice,5,
