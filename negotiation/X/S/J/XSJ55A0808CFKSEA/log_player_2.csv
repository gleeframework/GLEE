"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has tremendous potential for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its value and gives you a good starting point for your investment.  Let's work together to make this a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price range. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000,  which still offers you a significant return on investment. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit further.  I'm going to offer $950,000. This represents a good compromise and allows us to both make a profit on this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I believe is a fair value for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $975,000. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I'm confident it represents a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this transaction and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $975,000, which is significantly closer to your ideal price range. It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate further and get a better price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice getting impatient and walking away."
