{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This will hopefully push Alice to negotiate and we can find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's closer, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice, as she seems to be willing to negotiate.  $95 is still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it's appealing enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to budge much lower.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to purchase the product from John for $100. This saves me time and ensures I get a better deal than what Alice is offering."
