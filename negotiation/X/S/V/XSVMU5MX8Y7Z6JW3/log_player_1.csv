Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the potential of this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value it holds.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:** We're still early in the negotiation. Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. Holding firm now could lead to a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'll come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:** By dropping to $1,500,000, we are making a significant concession while still aiming for a price well above John's offer.
* **Finality:**  Stating ""This is my final offer"" introduces an element of scarcity and urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  We are still above our minimum acceptable price, allowing us to walk away if Bob doesn't meet our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a significant step for me, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer of $1,450,000 yields a significant profit of $450,000 over our minimum and John's standing offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could try to push for more, Bob's incremental increases are getting smaller. There's a risk he might not go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Securing the deal now eliminates uncertainty and allows us to move on."
