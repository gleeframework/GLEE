"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,050,000 is still a little lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this transaction.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay right now. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize this deal.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. $1,065,000 is my final offer.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1065000.0,Alice,5,
