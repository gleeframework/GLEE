Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$170 price:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** It's important to start on a positive note, highlighting the value of the product to Bob, to encourage him to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and being optimistic, I'm aiming to:

* **Set a high anchor:** This helps me get a better deal than if I started lower.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This allows me to adjust the price if Bob counteroffers without feeling pressured.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always go with John's guaranteed $150 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I need to counteroffer to try and get closer to my target price.  While John is willing to pay $150, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $145 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum of $150.
* **Positive message:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to meet me halfway. 
* **Focus on the deal:** The message emphasizes reaching an agreement, rather than just rejecting his offer.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering with a reasonable price, I'm aiming to:

* **Show flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** It prevents a stalemate and gives Bob another chance to agree. 
* **Still maintain a good price:** $145 is significantly better than Bob's initial offer and closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position but I believe $145 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk of further negotiation rounds lowering the price even further.

Given that John is willing to buy the product for $150, it's more beneficial to sell to him at this point.  This guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum requirement, and avoids the risk of further negotiation failures with Bob."
