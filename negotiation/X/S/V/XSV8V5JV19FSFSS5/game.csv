"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This price is a significant discount considering the value it will bring to your business. I'm confident that this is a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
