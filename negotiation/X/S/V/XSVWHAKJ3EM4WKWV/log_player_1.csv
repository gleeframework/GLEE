I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer. I'm confident he'll find this price attractive since it's still less than the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still a fair price for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000. I'm hoping that this compromise will be enough to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to budge on his price, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $10,000, I'll sell to him instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
