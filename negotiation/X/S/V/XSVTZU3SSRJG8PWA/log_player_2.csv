"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $13,700? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** At $13,700, Alice's offer is lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  Bob has already lowered the price significantly.  Another counteroffer might push Alice away, making John the only option.

By accepting the offer, Bob saves $300 compared to buying from John."
