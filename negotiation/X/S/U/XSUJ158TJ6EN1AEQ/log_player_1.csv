Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $120. This price is above my minimum of $80 and leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good starting point as it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counter-offering with $110. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
