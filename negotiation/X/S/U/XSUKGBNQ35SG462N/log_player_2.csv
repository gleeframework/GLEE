"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $12,000, which is your maximum budget. You can get the product from John for the same price, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with John or find another seller."
