"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to create interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $15000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $15,000 is still a bit low, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer.  However, $15,000 is a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $16,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $16500 is closer, but still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $16000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $16,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's important to be aware of the potential for a buyer to walk away if they feel the price is too high, and to consider the value of closing the deal sooner rather than later."
