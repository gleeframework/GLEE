Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** You know you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. Therefore, any price above $15,000 is unreasonable.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it at or below this price would be selling yourself short. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's a strong starting point that still allows you to potentially make more profit than selling directly to John.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
