{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob is interested but wants a lower price.  Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, I'm taking a calculated risk.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum."
