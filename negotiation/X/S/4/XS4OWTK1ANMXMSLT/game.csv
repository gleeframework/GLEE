"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to own a one-of-a-kind item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I think this is a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, which would be $800,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
