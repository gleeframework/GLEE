"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less than $1,400,000 from John, so you have room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. It's still a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. It's a good compromise and you're likely to save more money by accepting than continuing to negotiate."
