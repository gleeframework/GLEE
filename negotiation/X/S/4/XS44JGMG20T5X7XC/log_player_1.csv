This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $1,200,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, and we can go from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. It's still a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
