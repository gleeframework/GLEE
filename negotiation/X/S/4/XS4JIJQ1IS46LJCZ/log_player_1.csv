{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Being polite:**  A friendly approach can make Bob more receptive.
* **Highlighting the value:**  Mentioning the product's worth to you adds legitimacy and can make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Offering a discount:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation, while still being a good deal for me. 
* **Inviting a response:**  Asking for Bob's opinion encourages him to engage. 

This approach aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm aiming for a higher price and am willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $13,000 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500.  This price still allows me to recoup some of the value I've invested in the product.  Let me know what you think. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  Showing respect for his position can keep the negotiation positive.
* **Counter with a compromise:**  Offering $13,500 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Reiterate your value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to you justifies the price.
* **Invite further discussion:**  Asking for his thoughts encourages him to continue negotiating."

**Explanation:**
