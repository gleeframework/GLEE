Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's aiming for a price well below your minimum.  At this stage, the difference between his offer ($950,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000) is too small to risk further negotiation. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
