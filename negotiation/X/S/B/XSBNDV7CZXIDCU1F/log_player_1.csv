"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $120 and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, but I'm not going to be too greedy in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $120. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm countering with $130. This is still above my minimum price, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I'm determined to get at least $120 for the product, and I believe I can do better with a counteroffer."

I'm countering with $125.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting this deal done.  I'm still above my minimum price, but I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal finalized."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price. I'm willing to accept this, as it's the best offer I've received from Bob so far. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on the deal entirely."
