"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900000.

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
