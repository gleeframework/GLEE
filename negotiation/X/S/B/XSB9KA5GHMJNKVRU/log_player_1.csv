Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $9,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $8,000, so I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $8,000 and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal altogether."
