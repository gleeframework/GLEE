Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation or for Bob to accept the offer outright.
* **Slight Markup:** A price of $135 represents a reasonable markup from your minimum price ($120) and allows for potential profit.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Important:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, moving closer to her minimum acceptable price of $120. Having John as a backup buyer ensures Alice won't be forced to accept an offer below her minimum."
