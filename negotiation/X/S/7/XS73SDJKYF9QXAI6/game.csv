"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return you stand to gain.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's worth to me and your potential profit, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects the product's value while ensuring a significant profit for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  I believe a fair price that would be beneficial for both of us is $950,000. This offer takes into account the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me halfway. I can let it go for $987,500. This is my final offer.",987500.0,Alice,5,
