"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's tempting to accept, I have a goal to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's worth to me and your potential profit, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects the product's value while ensuring a significant profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still too high. I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get it even lower. There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to work towards a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  I believe a fair price that would be beneficial for both of us is $950,000. This offer takes into account the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me halfway. I can let it go for $987,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my target price. While I could continue to negotiate, I need to consider the time factor. I've already rejected two offers, and with only 5 rounds remaining, I risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price, saving me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
