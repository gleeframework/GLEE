"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Alice is likely willing to negotiate or lower the price somewhat to make a sale."
