{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is far too expensive at $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice."

While $12,200 is closer to my budget than John's price, I'm going to keep negotiating. I still have a few rounds left and I think I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm making a final push with this counteroffer.  This is still a significant saving compared to Alice's last offer, and I'm hoping she'll finally accept it.  If she rejects it, I'll have to consider buying from John in the next round."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation and Alice is not budging much. I'm getting close to my limit and don't want to risk losing the product completely. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
