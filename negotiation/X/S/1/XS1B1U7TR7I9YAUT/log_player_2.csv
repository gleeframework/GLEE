{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While there are still a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly clear that Alice is unlikely to go lower.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is high.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000 to ensure he gets the product and stays within his budget."
