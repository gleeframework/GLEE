Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still potentially exceeding your minimum price.
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's value and existing interest, subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value of $8,000."
