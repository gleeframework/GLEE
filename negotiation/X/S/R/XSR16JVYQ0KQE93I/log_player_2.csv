"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This allows for some profit for you while staying within my price range. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still within his budget and significantly lower than what John is offering.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoid potentially prolonged negotiations or risking missing out on the product altogether."
