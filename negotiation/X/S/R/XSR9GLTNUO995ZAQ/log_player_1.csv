"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $13,500 is still below my minimum, and I have time to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $13,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price,  $13,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum. It's worth trying to get a bit more, as I have more rounds left and can always sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $13,625. This is a very fair price, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $13,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  I've reached a point where Bob is unlikely to budge further, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure the higher price from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
