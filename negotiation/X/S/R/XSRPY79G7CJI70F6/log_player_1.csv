"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm aiming for a higher price than $9,000, and I believe I can still get it from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
