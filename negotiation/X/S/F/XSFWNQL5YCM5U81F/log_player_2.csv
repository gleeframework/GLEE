Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this now.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal, and it allows us to move forward. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,875. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, he only has three rounds left.  It's likely that Alice won't go any lower, and he's better off locking in the $8,000 price from John to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
