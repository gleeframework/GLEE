"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum price ($8,000) and you save $500.  It's a good deal and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price in the next round. Buying from John for $8,000 is a less favorable option."
