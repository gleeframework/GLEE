"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum of $80, but still well below what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows for room to negotiate and gives Bob an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than my minimum of $80, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit high at $100. How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to get a better price. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $105 isn't my ideal price, it's a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $80. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
