"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is still a little bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks again for your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. Would you be open to $12,000? I think that would be a great price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
