"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget, and you have room to negotiate.
* **There's potential to get a better deal.** You haven't explored Alice's bottom line yet.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  This ensures you have an alternative if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her minimum. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message highlights the ""good price"" for both sides, encouraging a collaborative approach.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** There's still space to bargain if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe the value this product brings justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This still reflects a significant return on your investment given the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down slightly, $920,000 is still outside your ideal price range. 
* **Further negotiation is necessary.**  You can likely push Alice down closer to your target price of $850,000.
* **Buying from John is still a backup.** This option remains viable if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $920,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic compromise:** This offer is a middle ground between your last offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes a ""good deal"" for both parties, promoting a win-win scenario.
* **Clear closing statement:** The message explicitly states your readiness to close the deal at this price, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
