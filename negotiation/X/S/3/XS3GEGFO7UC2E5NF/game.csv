"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe the value this product brings justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This still reflects a significant return on your investment given the product's worth to you.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $920,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
