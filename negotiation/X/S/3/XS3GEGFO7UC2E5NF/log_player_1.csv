"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my target price and what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept such a low offer this early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe the value this product brings justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This still reflects a significant return on your investment given the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 920000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm strategically decreasing my asking price to demonstrate flexibility while remaining firm on a price that reflects the product's value. This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to make a more substantial move toward my target price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $920,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is a strong price, and while it's not my ideal target, it represents a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. Holding out for more might risk losing the deal entirely, and $900,000 is a good outcome."
