"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. However, $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, Alice. I can do $1,225,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
