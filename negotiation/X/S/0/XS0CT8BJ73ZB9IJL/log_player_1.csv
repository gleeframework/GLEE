Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. My budget allows me to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. It's worth pushing a bit further to maximize profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us. While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't accept anything less than $1,280,000.  This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers interested."",
""product_price"": 1280000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Adding pressure:**  By introducing the idea of other buyers and calling this a ""final offer,"" we're adding a sense of urgency. 
* **Small concession:** The move from $1,300,000 to $1,280,000 shows willingness to compromise, which might encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Still profitable:** $1,280,000 is still a substantial profit above John's offer, leaving room for a potential counter-offer from Bob within a range we'd find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your final offer. I've done some research and found that the product is not unique, and there are alternatives available. I would like to propose a price of $1,260,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could potentially push for a bit more, Bob has countered our ""final offer"" and introduced the idea of alternatives, potentially weakening our position.
* **Strong Profit:**  $1,260,000 is still a very strong profit, exceeding John's offer by $260,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or further lowering his offer. Accepting now secures a substantial gain."
