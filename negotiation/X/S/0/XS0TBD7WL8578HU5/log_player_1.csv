Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down later.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at it by mentioning ""its value."" This subtly implies the price isn't arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains conversational (""What do you think?"") signaling you're open to discussing the price further if Bob counters.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed your minimum acceptable price from John."
