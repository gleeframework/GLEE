{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. I believe it's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a higher price.  $90 is closer to my minimum, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
