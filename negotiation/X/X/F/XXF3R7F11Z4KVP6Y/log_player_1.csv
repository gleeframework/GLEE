Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $12,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both in a good position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $12,500 is closer to my asking price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I believe there's room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,500.  This price reflects the value of the product to you and ensures I can cover my costs.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
