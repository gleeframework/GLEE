Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed, while also hopefully encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $10,000 as possible."

Bob's offer of $10,500 is just above my minimum of $10,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,500,  it's a good deal and I'm running out of time. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
