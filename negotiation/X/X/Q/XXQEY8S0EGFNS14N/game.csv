"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11150. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though - I'll sell the product to you for $11150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love this product!",11150.0,Alice,7,
