"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.  Let's split the difference and close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is closer to your last offer. I believe this is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
