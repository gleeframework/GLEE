"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to ensure I'm getting the best possible price.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we could start a conversation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
