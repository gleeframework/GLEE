Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still being significantly above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly above the midpoint between your minimum and Bob's maximum appears more reasonable than starting extremely high.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
