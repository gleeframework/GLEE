Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping Bob sees the value and is willing to negotiate towards this price. If he's not, I'll have to gauge his interest and counter-offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000, and it also doesn't leave much room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer. I'm hoping to find a price that's more in line with the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum price, and it's the same as what John is offering. I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
