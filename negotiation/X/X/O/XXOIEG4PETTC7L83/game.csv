"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your budget,  $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,250,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my limits.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
