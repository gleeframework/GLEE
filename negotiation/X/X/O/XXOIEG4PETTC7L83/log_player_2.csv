Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your budget,  $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,250,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.
