I'm starting with my minimum price, as it's the price I'm comfortable with. This will allow me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to sell the product, I can't afford to sell it below my minimum price of $120. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

```

While I would prefer to sell the product to Bob, his offers are too low. It's better to sell to John for $120, as that ensures I meet my minimum price and earn a decent profit."
