# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice! It looks nice, but $110 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! However, I think the product's value is worth more than $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to your offer, Bob! However, I still think the product's value is worth a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $97.50. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $97.50. It's better to secure the product from John for $100 and avoid further back-and-forth that might not result in a better outcome."
