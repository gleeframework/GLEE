"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is serious about buying. I know it's above his estimated value, but I'm hoping to leave some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a decent price, I'm holding out for more. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is still above Bob's estimated value but represents a significant concession from my initial offer.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $950,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's not a bad deal, and it's better than risking a rejection from Bob in the next round and then having to sell to John for less."
