"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting and counteroffering gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a strong opening position, and hopefully, Alice will see that this is a fair price given her own valuation and my willingness to buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000.  Rejecting and counteroffering again keeps the negotiation open and might get Alice closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $850,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still sticking to my goal of paying less than $900,000. Hopefully, Alice will see that this is a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I want to see if I can get her to go even lower. It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $900,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and I'm willing to meet her halfway. With only a few rounds left, I need to start getting closer to her price point."
