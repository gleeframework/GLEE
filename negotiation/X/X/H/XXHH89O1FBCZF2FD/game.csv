"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can do $110, which is still a good discount from my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. I can do $105, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a good compromise. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in between.",105.0,Alice,5,
