"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can do $110, which is still a good discount from my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. I can do $105, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a good compromise. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in between. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105, and it's better to secure the product at a guaranteed $100 from John than risk the negotiation failing with Alice."
