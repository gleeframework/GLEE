"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth.  If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further.  If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a higher price than her product is worth to her ($8,000). 
* While her offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget ($12,000), it's still a significant markup.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much. There's a chance she'll come back with a lower offer closer to her true valuation. 
* Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $12,000."
