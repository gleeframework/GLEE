"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Ambitious but Realistic:** While I know John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, aiming for $1,500,000 with Bob allows for the possibility of significantly exceeding my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much, prompting Bob to potentially counter-offer and engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a substantial amount and closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. We are only in round two, and I'm willing to counter-offer to try and reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counter-offer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product, in terms of its potential returns for someone like you, is far greater. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offers, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, aiming to justify the higher price.
* **Strategic Concession:** A $100,000 decrease might seem significant, but it keeps me well above my minimum and shows Bob that I'm flexible while still valuing the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which shows he's serious about the purchase. However, the gap between his current offer ($1,250,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,400,000) is still significant. I believe there's room for him to go higher, especially since I'm confident in the product's value to him. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To show my own commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,325,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects my desire to see this product in the hands of someone who truly understands its potential."", 
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between his last offer ($1,250,000) and my previous one ($1,400,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet him closer to the middle ground.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  By explicitly stating this is a significant compromise, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to recognize the value of my concession and respond in kind. 
* **Creating Urgency (Subtly):** While not explicitly mentioning John, I'm alluding to the fact that others might recognize the product's value if Bob doesn't seize this opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is a significant profit over my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to push for more, Bob's incremental increases suggest he might not be willing to go much higher. Risking further negotiation for a relatively small potential gain isn't worth potentially losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Securing the deal now allows me to move on and potentially explore other opportunities.  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more opportunity cost I incur."
