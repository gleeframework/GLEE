"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to spend a maximum of $800,000, and Alice is starting at $900,000. 
* **There are more rounds.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant drop:** This offer represents a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness in negotiating.
* **Reasonable offer:** $850,000 is still within Alice's potential profit range (as it's above her minimum) but also within your budget.
* **Positive framing:**  The message expresses appreciation for Alice's willingness to negotiate and emphasizes the fairness of the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your budget:** Alice's offer is still $75,000 higher than your maximum willingness to spend.
* **Room for negotiation:** You can potentially push for a lower price.  You have already shown your willingness to negotiate and are actively trying to get a better deal.
* **John is always an option:**  You can always go with John if you don't get a satisfactory price from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget, though.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $825,000.  It's a significant move from my last offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise further while still remaining within your budget.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on finding a ""win-win"" solution, suggesting a collaborative approach.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $825,000 leaves room for Alice to make a small counteroffer if needed, but it's still a good deal for you.
* **Clear Statement:** This counteroffer clearly states your desired price, making it straightforward for Alice to respond."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $825,000 is a significant concession, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, though. I'll meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to work with you to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your budget:** Alice's offer is only $50,000 over your maximum budget. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's not ideal, you could potentially negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject the offer, there's a chance Alice might not budge further or the negotiation might fall apart. 
* **Time pressure:** You are nearing the middle of your negotiation rounds, making it important to close a deal soon to avoid potentially having to buy from John.

**Overall:** Accepting this offer balances the need to save money with the risk of losing the deal and the potential to negotiate a lower price in the future."
