Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, offering a brief reason (""great deal for the value"") can sometimes nudge buyers towards accepting.
* **Knowing Your Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that price with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price he might find reasonable."
