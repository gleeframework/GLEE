"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  Given its unique value, I believe a price of $11,500 is fair. It's a significant discount compared to what it's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. While it's a discount, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
