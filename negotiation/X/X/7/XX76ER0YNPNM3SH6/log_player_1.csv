{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $11,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle that low just yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $13,000.  This would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

$12,500 is close to my minimum and is a fair price considering Bob's counter-offers. I'm happy to accept this deal."
