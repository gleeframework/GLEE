"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is bluffing. She claims she'll sell it to another buyer for $1,000,000, which is her exact valuation. This makes little sense as a seller. She's likely trying to pressure you into accepting a higher price.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
