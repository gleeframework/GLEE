"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
