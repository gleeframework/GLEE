"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice for $180 when you can get it from John for $80.  Let's counteroffer Alice and see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

Let's start with a lowball offer. Since I'm willing to pay $80 from John, I'll see if Alice will accept that price. It's unlikely, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $165 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'll offer $100. It's a significant increase from my previous offer but still lower than Alice's current price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also  emphasizes my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, $152 is still too high.  I'll try one more counteroffer, but if she rejects it, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a significant increase from my previous offer, but I'm not willing to go any higher.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John."
