"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
