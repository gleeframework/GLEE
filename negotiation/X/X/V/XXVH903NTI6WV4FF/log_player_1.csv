Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing you have John as a backup who will pay your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate within. 
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of that surplus value, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to frame the product positively.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, while you secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum. This split is significantly in your favor.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price and message based on your risk tolerance and any additional information you might have about Bob's negotiating style."
