"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $120.  This initial offer will help me gauge Bob's interest and potential buying range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is still a decent profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer of $150.  It's a compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer at $110, I'm going to reject it.  It's still below my minimum, and with a few rounds left, there's a chance I can get a better price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, but I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. It's a small increase from Bob's offer, but it's still within my acceptable range and could potentially convince him to close the deal.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while staying close to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting too low, and I only have four rounds left. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
