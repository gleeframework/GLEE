{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now getting very close to his maximum budget. He's taking a calculated risk by increasing his offer significantly. He's banking on the fact that Alice might be willing to accept this offer and close the deal rather than risk going through another round.  It's a gamble, but it could save him $2,000 compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough choice for Bob!  He's already very close to his maximum budget, and with only one round remaining, the chances of negotiating a lower price are slim.  

* **Accepting Alice's offer** would save him $200 compared to buying from John, but it's still a significant amount of money. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer** has a high risk of failure.  If Alice rejects his counteroffer, he'll have to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Buying from John** guarantees him the product at his maximum budget.

Considering the high risk of further negotiation, Bob decides to go with the safer option and buy the product from John.  It's a better financial decision than risking a failed negotiation and being forced to pay a higher price."
