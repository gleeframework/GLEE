"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than the value I place on it, but still allows me to make a profit. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the value you see in the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
