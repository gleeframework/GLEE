"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer (Anchoring):**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both our valuations sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob rejects it, his counteroffers are likely to be influenced by this high starting point.
* **Signals Value:** The high price immediately communicates that I believe the product is highly valuable, potentially exceeding even Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  The inflated price provides ample space for negotiation over the 10 rounds, increasing the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above our minimum, it's still significantly below his own valuation of the product. Rejecting his offer allows us to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiating position:** Accepting immediately might signal desperation and limit our ability to secure a higher price.
* **Continue to probe Bob's willingness to pay:**  His counteroffer provides valuable information, but we can likely push for more. 
* **Leverage the remaining rounds and the John option:**  We have time and alternatives, giving us leverage to negotiate patiently."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly unique and goes beyond a simple price tag. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, reflecting my desire to find a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial price ($150,000), demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm (for now):**  The new price is still substantially above both our minimum and Bob's offer, aiming to keep the negotiation moving in our desired direction.
* **Justification:**  We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's unique value, attempting to nudge his perception closer to our asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend, But Room Remains:**  Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which is a good sign.  The gap between our positions is narrowing, but $1,500,000 is still below what we believe we can achieve.
* **Time Advantage:** We have six rounds remaining, so there's no need to settle prematurely.  Continuing to negotiate preserves our opportunity to secure a higher price.
* **Alternative Safety Net:** The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing us to maintain a firm stance with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this negotiation.  To show my good faith, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,575,000.  I believe this represents a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1575000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between our previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. It signals fairness and a strong desire to reach an agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,575,000 is still a significant profit margin above our minimum. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing this as a compromise and highlighting the ""true value,"" we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency without resorting to aggressive tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,575,000. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Tactic:** Bob's offer has actually decreased from his previous one. This suggests he might be testing our resolve or trying to stall for time, hoping we'll cave under pressure. 
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** Accepting this lower offer could signal that we're willing to significantly devalue the product, which could hurt our negotiating position in later rounds.
* **Calculated Risk:** We still have four rounds left and the safety net of selling to John. This allows us to apply a bit more pressure without jeopardizing the entire deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, and I want to be upfront. While I'm committed to finding a fair deal with you, I also have other interested parties. I'm willing to hold firm at $1,550,000, but this is my final offer. I believe it reflects the true value of this product and offers a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're making a small concession ($25,000) to demonstrate continued good faith, but we're also drawing a line in the sand. This shows we're serious about closing the deal but not desperate.
* **Introducing Competition (Subtly):** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" we're creating a sense of urgency without explicitly threatening to walk away.  This reminds Bob that we have alternatives.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By labeling this our ""final offer,"" we're aiming to elicit Bob's best and final counter. It forces him to decide if he's willing to meet us closer to our price or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing Our Resolve:** Bob's offer is still below our ""final offer,"" suggesting he might be testing our commitment. Accepting now could signal weakness and make him less likely to move closer to our desired price.
* **Limited Losses:**  We're only two rounds away from potentially having to accept John's offer.  Holding out for one more round carries a relatively small risk compared to the potential reward of securing a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Timing:**  Rejecting in this round gives us one more opportunity to make a final counteroffer in Round 9, putting the pressure back on Bob to either accept a price closer to our target or risk losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to a deal that benefits us both. I'm ready to compromise one last time. I'll accept $1,515,000.  This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I need your decision now. Let's get this done."",
""product_price"": 1515000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push with Urgency:**  This offer makes a small concession ($35,000) to signal our flexibility, but the language is firm and decisive. We are creating a strong sense of urgency by highlighting this as our last move.
* **Splitting the Difference (Again):** This price splits the difference between Bob's last offer and our previous ""final offer."" It reinforces our willingness to compromise but sets a clear limit. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only one round remaining, Bob is out of opportunities to test our resolve. He must now decide if he's willing to pay a price that reflects the product's value or risk losing it altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is not budging:**  Bob has repeated the same offer twice after our ""final offer"" and ultimatum. It's clear he's unwilling to meet us at a price that reflects the product's value.
* **No More Rounds:**  We've exhausted our negotiation rounds with Bob. Further attempts to negotiate are unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's standing offer of $1,000,000 guarantees us a substantial profit and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing. 

While we could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the potential gain is not worth the risk of losing a guaranteed $1,000,000. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and move on to the sure thing."
