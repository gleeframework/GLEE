You should reject the offer. It's still above your target price of $150, and you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets you the product you want. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $125 is within your budget, and you're likely to save more money than if you buy from John. It's a good deal, so you should accept."
