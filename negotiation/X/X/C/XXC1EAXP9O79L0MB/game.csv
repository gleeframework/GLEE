"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $8200. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7600?  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",7600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7600. However, I'm willing to make one more concession.
