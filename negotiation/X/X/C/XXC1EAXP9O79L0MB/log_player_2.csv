Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He has a lot of room to negotiate down from $15,000.  There's a good chance he can get a better price from Alice."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's lower than her original price, it's still a bit higher than his counteroffer. He can likely negotiate further and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7600. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $8000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten Alice down to $8,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial asking price.  Continuing to negotiate might get him a slightly better price, but it's likely not worth the risk.  If he rejects this offer, he might end up having to buy from John at $15,000."
