"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm offering it to you at $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what I'm selling.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,250,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues what's being offered. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is my final offer for this round.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm firm on $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product.  I'm ready to finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some urgency on your end, and I want to find a resolution.  While I'm still aiming higher, I'm willing to consider $1,750,000. This offer represents a significant compromise to bridge the gap.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,750,000 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
