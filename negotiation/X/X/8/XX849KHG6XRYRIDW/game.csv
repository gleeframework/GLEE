"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still offers you a significant return on your investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
