"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer leaves room for negotiation. While $1,200,000 is a significant markup for you, it's highly unlikely Alice would accept an offer as low as $1,000,000 immediately. By rejecting and countering, you can try to meet somewhere in the middle while still potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($900,000) leaves room for negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it signals that you're serious about the purchase but need a more competitive price.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief explanation that the initial offer is beyond your budget adds a sense of reasonableness to your counter-proposal.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and optimistic tone encourages further negotiation and avoids coming across as confrontational."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still offers you a significant return on your investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our ideal price, which is encouraging. However, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're willing to walk away if we don't get a price closer to our target. This keeps the pressure on Alice while allowing us to inch closer to a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,000,000 even? That's my absolute best offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By proposing $1,000,000, we're splitting the difference between her counter-offer ($1,100,000) and our initial counter-offer ($900,000). This demonstrates flexibility on our part while still achieving our target price.
* **Firm but Fair:** We're clearly stating this is our ""best offer,"" signaling that we're unwilling to go any higher.  This puts the decision back in Alice's court. 
* **Walk-Away Option:** We're comfortable with the possibility of Alice rejecting this offer because we can always buy from John at the same price. This gives us leverage in the negotiation."
