"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'm not going to sell the product to Bob for $8,000, that's way below my minimum price. And selling it to John for $15,000 is a good option, so I'll choose that.
