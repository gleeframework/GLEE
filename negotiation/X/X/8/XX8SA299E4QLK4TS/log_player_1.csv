"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price quickly. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can do better. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial offer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now just $1,000 below my minimum, and we are already halfway through the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by being too greedy, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum.  It's a reasonable price, so I'll take it."
