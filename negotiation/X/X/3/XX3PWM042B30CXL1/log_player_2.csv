"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, aiming to bring the price closer to my target. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8,500? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but it's still above John's price. I'll try to negotiate a bit further before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, my budget is really pushing it at that point.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

This counter-offer aims for a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current one. It keeps the negotiation moving while showing willingness to compromise, but not completely caving to her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $8,250? That's a compromise from my last offer and still a great deal for you! I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating in good faith and has come down considerably. While it's slightly more than John's price, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  Accepting now secures the product and avoids the risk of losing it by pushing further."
