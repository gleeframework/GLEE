"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8,500? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, my budget is really pushing it at that point.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $8,250? That's a compromise from my last offer and still a great deal for you! I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,5,
