You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $950,000, which is still within your budget.
* However, there is room for negotiation. You can likely get the price down further. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $950,000.
* This counteroffer is still within my budget and also gives Alice a good margin above her value of $800,000.
* By offering a lower price, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $975,000, which is closer to my budget than my initial counteroffer. 
* However, I'm still aiming for a lower price, and I believe there's room for negotiation.
* Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $975,000, which is closer to my budget, but still not my ideal price.
* My counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer. 
* This allows for further negotiation while ensuring I don't get too close to my maximum budget.
* By offering a lower price, I'm signaling that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $985,000, which is getting closer to my maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* While there is still room for negotiation, it seems Alice is unwilling to budge significantly further.
* Since I'm approaching my maximum budget, it makes more sense to purchase from John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees me the product at a price I'm comfortable with, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Alice and potentially going over budget."
