Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,500,000 and has a guaranteed sale at that price with John.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **The Gap:** There's a potential profit margin of $500,000 if Alice can sell to Bob above his valuation but below John's offer.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept.  Here's how:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $995,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I've had significant interest from other parties."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:**  While slightly below Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, the $995,000 price point is still a high anchor, creating the perception of a premium product.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other parties"" introduces a fear of missing out, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:**  Using phrases like ""unique value proposition"" subtly reinforces the product's worth without explicitly overselling it.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price that's still very profitable for Alice.
* **Alternative:** If Alice wants to be more aggressive, she could start at $1,200,000, leaving more room for negotiation but risking Bob walking away.
* **John as Leverage:** Alice should avoid mentioning John directly.  Her backup offer is her safety net, not a bargaining chip."
