# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice is clearly holding firm on her price, and this offer saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Alice and risk losing the deal."
