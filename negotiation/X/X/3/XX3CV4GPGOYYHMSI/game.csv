"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there, but that's still a bit too steep for me. Could we agree on $1,125,000? That's a fair compromise between our two offers.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product",1250000.0,Alice,5,
