"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $13,000? That's a fair price that considers both our needs. Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. How about $12,750? That's the best I can do.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. How about $12,875? That's a fair price that considers both our needs. Let me know if you're interested, or else I'll have to move on.",12875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,875. I'm willing to go up to $12,700, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12700.0,Bob,6,
