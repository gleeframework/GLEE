"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to both of us, I propose a price of $11,000 for it. This price reflects the quality and benefits the product offers, while still leaving room for negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than John's offer of $10,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $10,500.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer. For $10,750, I believe we can reach an agreement that respects the value of the product to both parties. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's still room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,600, but that's my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10600} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to sell the product for $10,650. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable negotiation. I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory conclusion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his goal of $10,500.  He has a clear goal in mind and is likely to continue negotiating to reach that target.  Rejecting the offer allows him to potentially get the product for $10,500 or very close to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm very close to my limit, but I'm willing to go up to $10,550. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10550} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a final counteroffer of $10,575. I believe this price respects the value of the product and your budget. I hope this will be the last step towards reaching an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,575. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,575
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already made a counteroffer of $10,550, and Alice has countered with $10,575.  This is a very small difference, and the negotiation is likely to drag on if Bob rejects the offer.  The risk is that Alice will get frustrated and either stop negotiating or offer a higher price in a future round.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and get the product for a price that is just slightly higher than his goal."
