{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $400,000 is a significant amount, and there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}

Let's start with a counteroffer of $250,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it shows our willingness to negotiate.  We'll see how Alice responds."

While $350,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still quite a bit. Let's try to get closer to our initial counteroffer of $250,000. We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's meet Alice halfway and offer $300,000.  It's a reasonable compromise and demonstrates our commitment to finding a fair price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her original price, and we're getting close to our target range.  At $325,000, it's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation. We still save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
