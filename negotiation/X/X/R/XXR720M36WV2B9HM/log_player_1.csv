This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
