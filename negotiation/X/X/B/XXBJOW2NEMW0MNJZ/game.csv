"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1100000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1100000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're committed to your price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1200000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the minimum I need to make a profit. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
