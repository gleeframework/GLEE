"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its significant worth in the right hands."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and reach a more agreeable figure. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a good backup plan, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a higher price from Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a strong offer, the value this product brings to the table is undeniable. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by a significant amount ($300,000) to show Bob I'm serious about finding a deal. However, I'm not dropping below my minimum threshold just yet.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the inherent value of the product. This reminds Bob why he's interested and justifies the higher price point.
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" encourages a collaborative negotiation instead of an adversarial one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I'll be getting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my minimum price. While $1,750,000 is tempting, I still have room to negotiate and a few rounds left. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to $1,800,000 before considering accepting his offer or moving to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. You clearly recognize the value of this product. How about we settle at $1,825,000? This reflects the significant benefits you'll gain while acknowledging your investment."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer with a smaller concession ($75,000) to signal I'm nearing my limit.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reinforcing the ""benefits"" angle to keep Bob focused on the product's worth beyond the price tag. 
* **Firm but Fair Tone:**  ""Settle at"" suggests this is a strong offer, encouraging acceptance without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,825,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has actually decreased, signaling that he may be less willing to meet my price. Continuing negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome than what I already have guaranteed with John. Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I get a fair deal without further risk or delay."
