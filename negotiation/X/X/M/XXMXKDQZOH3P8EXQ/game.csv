"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's uniqueness and value, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll consider selling it to you for $1750000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet the $1750000 price point given my current financial situation. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. This is the highest amount I can reasonably offer while staying within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your financial constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1600000. I'm willing to make another compromise and meet you at $1650000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
