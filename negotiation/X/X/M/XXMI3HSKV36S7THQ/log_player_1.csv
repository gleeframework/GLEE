Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $11,500 is more than $10,000, giving Bob a reason to consider it.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  $11,500 is less than your minimum of $12,000, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.

Remember, this is just the beginning of the negotiation process. Be prepared to respond to Bob's counteroffers or switch to John if the negotiations don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it's worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500? This is a good compromise that will make us both happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
