"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $1,050,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $1,075,000? I believe that's a more balanced price considering the product's value and my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to close the deal with you.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
