"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I need to keep my costs down. Would you consider lowering the price to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant saving over your initial valuation, and it allows me to meet my minimum price point. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
