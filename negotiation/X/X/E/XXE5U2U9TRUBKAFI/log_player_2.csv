"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's clear there's a lot of room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to offer $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value you've mentioned.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's a compromise from my previous offer of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but she's still too high for my budget.  I've already made a significant compromise, and it's clear she's not willing to go any lower.  To avoid further rounds of negotiation and ensure I don't exceed my budget, I'll go ahead and purchase from John at $8,000.  While I would prefer to get a lower price, this guarantees I get the product within my budget."
