"I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to offer $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value you've mentioned.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000.
