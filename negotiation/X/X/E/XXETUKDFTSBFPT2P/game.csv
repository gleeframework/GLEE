"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1050000. This seems like a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're eager to get this product. However, $1050000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still reflects the product's unique value and potential, and it gives us both a chance to make this a successful transaction. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer $1075000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to the value you've indicated.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and will allow us to complete this deal successfully.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1075000 is closer, it's still not quite meeting my needs.  To make this a win-win, I'm willing to go down to $1090000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and leaves us both with a good outcome. Let's close this deal and get you the product you've been looking for.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
