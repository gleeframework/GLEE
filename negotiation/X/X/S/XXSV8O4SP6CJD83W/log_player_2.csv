"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer.  By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price and saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows I'm serious about getting a better price. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it's a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my maximum, I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so there's still room to improve the deal. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $130.  This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. It's a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within my acceptable range and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice refusing to budge is too high.  Accepting the offer is the best course of action to secure the product at a good price."
