"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and represents a fair value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need.  How about we split the difference at $925,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",925000.0,Alice,5,
