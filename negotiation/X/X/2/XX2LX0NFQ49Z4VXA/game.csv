"Thanks for the offer Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $125 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to offer $115. It's a fair price, and I think it gives us both a good deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $120. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
