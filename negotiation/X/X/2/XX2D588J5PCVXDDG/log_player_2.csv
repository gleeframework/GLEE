"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You are willing to pay no more than $100, so you should reject the offer and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $150 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $100 for the product? This still reflects its value to me while being more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is exactly your maximum budget.  While you could try to negotiate lower, there's no guarantee she'll budge further.  Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product without exceeding your limit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal to John."
