"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. Bob likely won't accept this on the first round, but it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  It's still a profitable deal for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has increased his offer to $9,500, which is closer to my desired price. While it's still below my minimum, it's getting closer. With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing out on this deal and potentially having to accept a lower offer later. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and minimizes the risk of a worse outcome."
