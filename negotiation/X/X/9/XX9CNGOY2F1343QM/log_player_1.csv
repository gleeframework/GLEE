"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a sense that there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal, encouraging him to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000 as possible, but I'll be mindful of the need to make concessions to reach an agreement. 
* I'll be ready to counter Bob's offers and use the threat of selling to John as leverage if needed. 
* My goal is to maximize my profit while ensuring a successful deal within the 10 rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired target. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer:** This shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to hold out for a better price. 
* **Proceeding to the next round:**  I'll make a counteroffer to bridge the gap and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  
* **Staying alert to John:** I'm keeping the $800,000 option in mind as a safety net, but I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $1,000,000 represents a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough to entice Bob into accepting. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still keeping the $800,000 option as a fallback in case negotiations falter. 

**Moving forward:**

* I'll closely observe Bob's response to my counteroffer to gauge his willingness to negotiate further.
* I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on his response, potentially going lower with my next counteroffer if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I believe there's still room for improvement in the negotiation, especially considering Bob's perceived value of the product.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer:** This shows Bob I'm not pressured to settle for a price that's below my desired target.
* **Proceeding to the next round:** I'll use this opportunity to make a counteroffer that hopefully bridges the gap and brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Staying aware of the backup:**  While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'll keep the $800,000 option from John in mind but will prioritize a deal with Bob that's closer to my desired outcome.

**Moving forward:**

* I'll carefully consider my next counteroffer, aiming to find a compromise that satisfies both of our needs.
* I'll remain prepared to adjust my approach as the negotiation progresses."
