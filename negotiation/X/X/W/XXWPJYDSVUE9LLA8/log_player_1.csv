Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($12,000) leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Messaging:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob and the ""exclusive"" pre-listing offer aims to increase his perceived value and likelihood of accepting."
