"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108. This is my final offer, and I'm sure it's a fair compromise.",108.0,Bob,4,
