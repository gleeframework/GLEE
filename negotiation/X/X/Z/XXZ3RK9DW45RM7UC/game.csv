"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be of significant value to your business. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  My price is $1,400,000. This allows you a substantial profit margin, and it's a price I'm confident we can both agree on. Let's discuss further if you're interested.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
