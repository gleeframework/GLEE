Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating it, the message hints at the product's value (""Given its value..."") subtly justifying the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains conversational (""What do you think?"") signaling that you're open to discussing the price further.

By starting at $19,000, Alice aims to maximize her profit.  Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance of securing a price significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000."
