"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I have a budget of $12,000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $14,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your limitations.  $14,000 is closer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,
