"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a good starting point, allowing for some negotiation room while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that if Bob rejects, I can adjust the price down in subsequent rounds while still remaining profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is above my minimum, I think I can still do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a potential agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $135. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal that exceeds my minimum and it's likely that we're reaching a point of compromise.  Further negotiations could be time-consuming and might risk losing the deal altogether."
