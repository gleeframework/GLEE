"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong opening offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though I haven't explicitly stated what the product is.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language used suggests a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm not revealing this yet. It's my fallback plan if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value it offers. Based on my budget and assessment of the market, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While there's potential for further negotiation, I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price. It makes the most sense to take the sure thing and maximize my profit."
