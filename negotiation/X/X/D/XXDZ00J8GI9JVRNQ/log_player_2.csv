"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth discussing a price that works for both of us. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $1,000,000 is still above your ideal price point.
* **Negotiation is key:** You have 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort:** John's offer is your absolute maximum, so it's best to see if you can get a better deal from Alice first."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

* **Further negotiation:** You have 7 rounds left, and there's still room for further negotiation. 
* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  It's always good to have a backup option, but you haven't exhausted your negotiation opportunities with Alice yet."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $970,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, $970,000 is still above your target. 
* **Time is running out:** You only have 3 rounds left. This is a critical point in the negotiation. 
* **John's offer is the safety net:** You're getting closer, but if you can't get a better deal in the next round, John's offer will ensure you get the product, even if it's at your maximum price.

**Strategy:**  You need to push for a lower price, but you also need to be mindful of time."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're almost there, Bob! I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to give up on getting the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one last concession and offer the product to you for $960,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiations with Alice.
* **Close to Target:**  $960,000 is very close to your ideal price point and a significant improvement from where you started. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If you reject this offer, you only have one round left to negotiate. There's a real risk that you won't be able to get a better deal and will be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. 

**Conclusion:**  While you ideally wanted to get a price closer to $950,000, it's better to accept this offer and secure the deal with Alice at a price that is still within your budget."
