"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you given its value to you. Let's find a middle ground. ",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,750. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,750 is closer, I'm still holding out for $8,900. It's a small difference, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",8900.0,Alice,5,
