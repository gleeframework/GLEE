"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $1,350,000.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,300,000.  This would be a great compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
