Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting very close.  I understand your budget limitations, but $1,210,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,230,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?
