"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $1,450,000 gives Bob a chance to make a counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $1,450,000 is still above my minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Establishing a good starting point:** This first offer sets the tone for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I'm still early in the negotiation process. I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm serious about my asking price and gives me leverage in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, given the product's value to your business. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close.  I understand your budget limitations, but $1,210,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,230,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1230000}

* **Encouraging action:**  The question ""What do you think?"" prompts Bob to respond and potentially accept the offer."
