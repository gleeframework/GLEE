"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, given the product's value to your business. Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This offer is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's fair considering the value you'll gain from this product.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting very close.  I understand your budget limitations, but $1,210,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,230,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",1230000.0,Alice,7,
