"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is just too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $9,000? That's still a great price for a product worth much more to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?  That's closer to what I had in mind.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
