Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and would be perfect for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $120, and it leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a reason to buy from me (the product's condition) and acknowledges his potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 seems a bit steep. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $110, it's below my minimum price of $120, and I can potentially get more from Bob or John. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is too low for me.  How about $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
