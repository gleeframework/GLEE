"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the product's exceptional qualities while still acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $950,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,375,000? This reflects significant movement on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,375,000 is still more than I can manage. I can go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
