"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than I can go at the moment.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
