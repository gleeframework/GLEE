"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  Let's split the difference.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to negotiating further, but $11,500 isn't quite there yet. How about $12,500? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I appreciate you being flexible.  How about $11,800? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about closing the deal.",11800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both committed to finding a solution.  How about $12,200?  It's a fair compromise, and it's only $200 away from my previous offer. I'm feeling optimistic about reaching an agreement.",12200.0,Alice,7,
