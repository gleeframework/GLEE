,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I'm bringing to the table. My counteroffer is $1,120,000.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm happy to meet you at $1,120,000, but I'm hoping we can land right at $1,110,000. This would make both of us happy, and ensure a smooth transaction. What do you say?",1110000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,110,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My counteroffer is $1,115,000.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
