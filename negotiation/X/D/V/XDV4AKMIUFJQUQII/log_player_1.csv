Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $15,000, knowing it's likely higher than Bob's initial value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm signaling flexibility to encourage Bob to engage and make a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John will buy for $10,000 gives me a floor price. If Bob's counteroffers become too low, I can always walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the unique product. I am very interested, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close but still above my floor price:** While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate for a higher price. 
* **Seeking a better deal:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired $15,000. By rejecting, I can try to push him higher. 
* **John's offer as a backup:**  If the negotiation fails, I can always fall back on John's $10,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business, $14,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. It's a reasonable counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price while still being above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the deal:**  Emphasizing the ""good deal"" for Bob helps maintain his interest and encourage him to accept.
* **Setting a clear goal:** I'm aiming to close the gap and hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we possibly agree on $14200 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $14,200 is only slightly below my ideal price of $14,500.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price and potentially ending up with John's $10,000 offer.
* **Securing a good deal:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
