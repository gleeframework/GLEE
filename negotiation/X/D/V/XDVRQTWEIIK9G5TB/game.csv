"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to consider $1100000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being fair to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while offering a significant discount from your initial offer. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
