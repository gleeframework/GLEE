"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to Alice's valuation of $8,000 as possible. A counteroffer of $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $9,000, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal. This counteroffer gives Alice room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a substantial savings compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a slight increase from her previous offer, which is unfavorable to Bob.  While it's still lower than John's price, there's a good chance Bob can negotiate a lower price, as he's already shown a willingness to go lower than $9,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving towards a more favorable price for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of getting a price as close to Alice's valuation as possible.  He increased his offer by $250 from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant savings compared to John's price. This counteroffer further tests Alice's willingness to lower her price while remaining within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is a significant increase from her previous offer and brings the price very close to John's price. While it's tempting to accept, Bob should continue negotiating as he still has a chance to get a lower price.  There's still room to haggle, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving towards a more favorable price for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  This counteroffer is a significant savings compared to John's price, while also being more attractive to Alice than her previous offer.  The hope is that Alice will find this offer appealing enough to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is getting very close to John's offer of $12,000.  The negotiation has reached a point where there's very little room for further savings.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice will raise her price even further, or the negotiation will stall, wasting valuable time.  Buying from John at this point provides certainty and avoids the risk of not securing the product at all."
