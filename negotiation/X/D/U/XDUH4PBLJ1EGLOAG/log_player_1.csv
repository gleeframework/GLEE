``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still securing a profit well above my minimum threshold.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not comfortable selling for that price yet.  I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000 to Bob. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if he counteroffers again, I'll have to consider selling to John if his next offer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's clear Bob isn't willing to go much higher, and I risk losing him if I counteroffer again.  This price secures me a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
