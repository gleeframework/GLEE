"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. I believe I can push for a better deal with Bob or potentially secure a sale with John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum desired price, I still need to get at least $1,200,000 for the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John would secure my desired price, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a slightly better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to reach a fair compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds, and Bob is refusing to go above $1,150,000.  This is still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
