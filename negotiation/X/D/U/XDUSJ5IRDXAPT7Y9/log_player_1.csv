Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay closer to my desired price. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer at $120, so I can afford to be slightly flexible with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $95 is better than $80, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $120.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, which gives me leverage in negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $110 to $105, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle ground:** $105 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, making it a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum value of $120 and have John as a backup, so I can afford to be slightly flexible. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am hoping to keep my expenses as low as possible. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between, say at $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  While $100 is still below my minimum value of $120, it's getting closer and represents a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer of $95.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  The negotiation process is taking time and effort, and continuing to reject offers could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.
* **John's offer:**  While I could still sell to John for $120, accepting Bob's offer would be a faster and more efficient transaction. 
* **Potential for future business:** Even though $100 is less than ideal, a successful transaction with Bob could lead to future opportunities for selling products at a better price in the future."
