"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($9,000) is higher than what you're willing to pay and higher than John's price ($10,000). 
* By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at a lower cost."
