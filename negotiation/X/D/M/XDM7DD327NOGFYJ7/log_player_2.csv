Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. I am willing to consider your offer and propose a price of $11000 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our respective positions and I believe it will be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above your target price of $10,000, but it's closer than her initial offer. It's a good compromise and a fair deal for both parties.  If you reject it and try to negotiate further, you run the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal.  Additionally, you could end up paying more if you decide to buy from John for $10,000.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product while still saving some money."
