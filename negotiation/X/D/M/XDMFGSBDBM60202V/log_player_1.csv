I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000 and leaves room for potential negotiation. It also allows for a decent profit margin while still being attractive to Bob, considering his value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a profit closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's higher than John's offer and gets me closer to my desired profit margin.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price."
