Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still too low, even though it's within the range of what Bob is willing to pay.  I'm hopeful that I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,000?  I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $8,750, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my goal of $9,000. We're still relatively early in the negotiation process, and I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I hear you. $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,875? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8875}
