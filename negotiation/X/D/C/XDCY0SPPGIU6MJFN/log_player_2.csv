**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly very attached to getting a price above $916,000.  While we might be able to push her down slightly in the last round, it's highly unlikely she'll go as low as John's $1,000,000 offer.  At this point, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of Alice refusing and leaving us with no deal.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John."
