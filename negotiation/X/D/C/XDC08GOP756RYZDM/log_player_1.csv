Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a bit higher. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This price still gives you a significant value compared to what you'd get elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with $10,000. I'll counteroffer again, but if it doesn't work out, I might consider selling to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to run out of rounds, I'm still not satisfied with $9,800. I'll counteroffer one more time, but if it doesn't work, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're very close to a deal.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. Let's finalize this now!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget, and I'd like to try to get as close as possible. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob. Although I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not comfortable with his latest offer of $9,500. I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John to avoid further haggling and potential loss of income."
