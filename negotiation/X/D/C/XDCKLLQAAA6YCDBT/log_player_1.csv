Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a strong offer ($925,000) leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for $800,000."
