Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he brings the price down.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While Bob values the product at $100, I'm aiming slightly above that to see if he's willing to pay a premium. 
* **Below John's Offer:** I know John will buy it for $150, which is my minimum. Offering it to Bob at $175 gives me some wiggle room while still ensuring a profit if Bob accepts.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob depending on his response."
