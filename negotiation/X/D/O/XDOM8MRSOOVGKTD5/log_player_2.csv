Alice's offer is too high.  I'm willing to pay up to $120, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can go.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $150 is still above my maximum budget of $120.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $120, as that's the best deal for me."
