It's better to try and negotiate with Alice further. You can offer a lower price and see if she's willing to compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $127.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

The offer is only $7.50 more than my desired price, it's worth accepting and saving $22.50 compared to buying from John."
