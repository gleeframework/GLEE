"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would allow for a comfortable profit margin for you while still being a good deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $900,000? It's a win-win that recognizes the product's true value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. Let's compromise at $875,000. This gives you a good return while still allowing me to make a solid profit. I believe this is a fair offer that could help us both close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to make this deal work, and I appreciate that. Let's try this – $887,500.  It splits the difference and keeps us both moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,
