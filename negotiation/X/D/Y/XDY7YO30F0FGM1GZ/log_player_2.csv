"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still too high, and he has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would allow for a comfortable profit margin for you while still being a good deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $900,000? It's a win-win that recognizes the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  $900,000 is still too high, even though Alice has come down from her initial offer.  He has a good chance of getting a better deal if he keeps negotiating, as he's shown he's willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. Let's compromise at $875,000. This gives you a good return while still allowing me to make a solid profit. I believe this is a fair offer that could help us both close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to make this deal work, and I appreciate that. Let's try this – $887,500.  It splits the difference and keeps us both moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and Bob is now only $37,500 away from his target of $850,000.  At this point, it's likely Alice won't budge much further, and continuing to negotiate could risk her walking away or Bob losing the product to John.  It's a good deal for Bob, and accepting the offer minimizes the risk of a bad outcome."
