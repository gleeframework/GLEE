"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You can get the product for $1,000,000 less from John, so there's room to negotiate.
* **Rejecting and counteroffering gives you leverage.**  Alice knows you have an alternative, so she's more likely to come down in price. 
* **Early rounds are crucial for establishing a lower price point.** By rejecting now, you set a precedent that you're not afraid to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  A $50,000 drop from Alice's initial offer shows you're serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects it, you know you need to adjust your strategy. 
* **Leaving room to negotiate:**  If Alice counters, you have room to increase your offer a bit without exceeding your $1,200,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial offer.** This means she's willing to negotiate, but not as much as you'd hoped. 
* **There's still room to improve the price.**  You're still $25,000 below your maximum, and you have several rounds left. 
* **Rejection maintains your negotiating position.**  By consistently rejecting, you signal that you're committed to getting the best deal, which could pressure Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate increase:** A $50,000 increase from your previous offer shows you're willing to compromise, but not at the expense of your desired price.
* **Building towards a middle ground:**  This counteroffer aims to find a midpoint between your desired price and Alice's latest offer.
* **Still leaving room for negotiation:** You have several rounds left, and Alice might need to come down further to close the deal.  This counteroffer allows for that possibility."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target price.**  Her offer is only $40,000 above your maximum, and you've already rejected her previous offer.
* **Time is of the essence.**  You've already been through several rounds, and you don't want to risk running out of time.
* **The risk is low.**  Even if you could negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of not reaching an agreement. Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product and move on."
