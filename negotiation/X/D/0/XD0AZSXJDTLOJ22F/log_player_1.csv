Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum of $12,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his initial valuation, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price.  I'm still keeping John in mind as a potential buyer if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500.  This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give it away for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there. I've already had two rounds of negotiation, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.  John is a sure thing for my desired price, so I'm going to take the guaranteed deal."
