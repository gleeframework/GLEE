"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11,150? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,900. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,900 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $11,025. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to get a valuable product.",11025.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10750.0,Bob,6,
