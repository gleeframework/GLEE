Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1350000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,350,000 is still a significant profit, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I have nine more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and selling to John is always an option if the deal with Bob falls through."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,360,000 is a decent price and a good profit. I've got enough rounds remaining to make a counteroffer if the deal with Bob falls through, and selling to John is still an option if necessary."
