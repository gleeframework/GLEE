"Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a steal! Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $112.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal.",112.5,Bob,4,
