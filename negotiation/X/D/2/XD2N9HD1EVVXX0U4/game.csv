"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $700,000 to $800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the product's worth to me. I look forward to your response.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your constraints.  While I value the product at a higher level, I'm willing to be flexible to find common ground. I can't go as low as $750,000, but I'm prepared to offer it to you for $850,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and a good price point for you. I hope this is a fair offer we can agree on.",850000.0,Alice,3,
