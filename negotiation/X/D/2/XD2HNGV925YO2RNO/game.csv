"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This price is fair, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,020,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know what you think.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
