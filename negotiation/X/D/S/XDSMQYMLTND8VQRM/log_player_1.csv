{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob has steadily increased his offer and stated this is his final price. Accepting $1,275,000 is a significant gain over John's offer of $1,000,000. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us with the guaranteed but lower offer from John."
