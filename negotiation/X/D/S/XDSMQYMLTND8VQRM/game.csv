"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, the value this product holds, particularly in its unique applications, makes it difficult to go that low.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's unique value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. To be honest,  $1,250,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. However, I value a good business relationship and I'm motivated to find an agreement with you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
