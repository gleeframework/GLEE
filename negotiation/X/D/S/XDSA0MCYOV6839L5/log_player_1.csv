"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some potential negotiation. It's also above my minimum value of $100, so I'm already making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum value of $100, so it's not a good deal for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $120, still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $95 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This is a significant compromise, but still a profitable price for me. I'm hoping this will be a good enough offer for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. 

It's become clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher than $100, and I've already had several rounds of negotiation. While I would prefer to make more money, I'm not willing to risk further rounds that might result in a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price, and it allows me to move on to other opportunities."
