"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $8,500 is still a decent profit for Alice, considering her value is $8,000.  
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is friendly but firm, leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8750. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good value:** $8,750 is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $10,000. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer represents a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob could get a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer or the negotiation taking longer is not worth it.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within the budget."
