Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose a counter-offer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies that the price is justified.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  By stating she's ""open to discussing,"" Alice encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process, increasing the chance of a sale above her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice has John as a backup, she doesn't mention him. Revealing this information could weaken her negotiating position."
