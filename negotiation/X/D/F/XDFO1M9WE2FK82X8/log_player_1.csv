Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $180. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering the product at $180, you can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can always negotiate down, knowing your safety net is selling to John for $150. 
* **""Worth a lot""**: This statement adds perceived value to the product without lying. 
* **Offering it ""first""**:  This creates a subtle sense of scarcity and might make Bob more inclined to accept."
