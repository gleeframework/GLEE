Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to make this offer especially attractive to ensure we can make a deal happen. Would a price of $1,100,000 be agreeable to you?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at Bob's valuation ($800,000) is unlikely to be successful, and offering it at our minimum ($1,200,000) leaves no room for negotiation and might scare Bob off.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still keeping the price significantly above his perceived value. This increases the chance of closing a deal above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we can always proceed with selling to John at our desired price."
