"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in paying $10,000 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product's value to her is lower than her asking price. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
