"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $150. Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's offer of $150, but there's still room to negotiate. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $130, which is still a good deal for me since it's below my maximum price of $150.  It also leaves some room for Alice to counter if she's willing to come down a little more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good deal for me. It's lower than my maximum price of $150 and it's better than John's offer of $150. There's not much room for negotiation at this point, so accepting the offer is the best choice."
