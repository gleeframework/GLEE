"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,150,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value of the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob has the opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to his desired price point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I need to get closer to $1,100,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not acceptable. Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice or buy the product from John at his maximum budget."
