Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider the value the product brings to you, and I believe it's worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
