"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a significant compromise.  It's a great price for a product that's worth so much to you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,
