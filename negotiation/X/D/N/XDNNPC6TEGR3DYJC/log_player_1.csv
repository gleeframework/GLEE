Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,300,000?  This price would still represent a significant value for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a significant move on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,300,000, $1,200,000 is a good deal considering I could sell to John for $1,000,000."
