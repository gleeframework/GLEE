Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm still confident I can get a better price, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000?  This allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
