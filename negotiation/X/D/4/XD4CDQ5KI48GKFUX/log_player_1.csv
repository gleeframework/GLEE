{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for room to negotiate without risking a deal at my minimum price.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness and value, making the offer more palatable to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've secured a profitable sale.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth negotiating further, considering John's offer of $1,500,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. I'll try to bridge the gap between our current positions."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $1,100,000 is closer,  it's still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, but also acknowledges the potential value you see in the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a midpoint between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's true value to justify the price.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I emphasize that this offer is a significant compromise on my part, making it seem more appealing to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! I've secured a deal that's closer to my desired price.
