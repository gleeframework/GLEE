"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $950,000.  This is a significant difference.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds, so there is time to negotiate and try to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John, but this is a last resort.

**Next Step:** You should counteroffer Alice with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's opening price, demonstrating your desire for a good deal. However, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Setting the tone:**  By starting with a strong counteroffer, you signal to Alice that you are serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  There's still space for Alice to meet you halfway, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still above what you're comfortable paying.
* **More room for negotiation:** You still have 7 rounds left, which gives you time to negotiate further and push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a backup:** If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John, but it's not the ideal scenario.

**Next Step:**  You should counteroffer Alice again with a price closer to your desired range. A good strategy is to gradually decrease your counteroffers, but avoid decreasing them by too much in each round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Keeping the pressure on:** You're showing Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal and aren't willing to settle for her initial asking price.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further and potentially reach a middle ground.

**Next Step:**  Observe Alice's response.  If she rejects, you can further adjust your counteroffer based on her stance in the following rounds. Remember, the goal is to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is moving in the wrong direction.**  It's higher than her previous offer, indicating she might be trying to push you towards a higher price.
* **Still time to negotiate:** You have 5 rounds remaining, enough to continue the negotiation and try to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort:** While John's offer is a guaranteed option, it's still much higher than you'd like to pay.

**Next Step:** You need to be firm but diplomatic. You should counteroffer with a price lower than your previous offer, but not too far below. This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating but also willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining pressure:** This shows Alice that you're not willing to be pushed around by her increasing offers.
* **Testing for compromise:**  This counteroffer provides Alice with another opportunity to meet you halfway and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Step:**  Observe Alice's response. If she rejects again, you can adjust your counteroffer in the next round.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still unacceptable.**  It's even higher than her previous offer, and significantly above your desired price range.
* **Time is running out, but not out yet.**  You have 3 rounds left, which is enough to continue negotiating and try to reach a compromise.
* **Buying from John is a significant loss.**  While it's a guaranteed option, it's the most expensive and would result in a significant loss for you.

**Next Step:** You need to be firm and assertive with your counteroffer.  You should aim for a price that's a significant decrease from Alice's current offer, but still within a reasonable range. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate, but also your commitment to getting a fair deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still unacceptably high.** Although slightly lower than her previous offer, it's still significantly above what you are willing to pay.
* **Final round approaching:**  This is the penultimate round, meaning you only have one more chance to negotiate before you must decide between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John.
* **Buying from John is a last resort:**  While it's a guaranteed option, it's significantly more expensive than your preferred outcome. 

**Next Step:** You need to make a final counteroffer that is a significant increase from your previous offer but still within your budget. Aim for a price that creates the most pressure on Alice to accept.  It might be your best chance to close the deal at a price you're comfortable with."
