Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the value to you (Alice), the message implies the product is worth a significant amount by using phrases like ""given its value.""
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly reminding Bob there's another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and competition.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable given the product's worth to him."
