"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price. I'm offering $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation so far.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing $1,050,000. This acknowledges your interest while recognizing the true value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're not willing to budge on the price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we try this - $1,012,000.  This shows movement on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1012000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the slight reduction in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,012,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",950000.0,Bob,6,
