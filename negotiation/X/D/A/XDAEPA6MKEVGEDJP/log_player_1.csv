Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price. I'm offering $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing $1,050,000. This acknowledges your interest while recognizing the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to budge on the price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still a ways off from my bottom line.  Bob is moving, but I'm aiming to get him closer to at least $1 million.  The risk of John's offer disappearing isn't high enough yet to accept $975,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we try this - $1,012,000.  This shows movement on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the slight reduction in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,012,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer movement is slowing down. It's unlikely he'll reach a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer means losing out on a significant amount compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to secure the sure thing."
