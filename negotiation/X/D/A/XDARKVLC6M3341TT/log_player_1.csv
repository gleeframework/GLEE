Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a lower price than the product's value to Bob:** This makes it more likely Bob will accept the offer.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $1,000 of potential profit for Bob, encouraging him to negotiate.
* **Is higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you're still getting a good deal. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept since you're in the middle of negotiations, it's important to hold your ground.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a better option right now, but there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, you can send a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to lower your price but still maintain a profit margin.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:** $13,000 is a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Includes a persuasive message:** The message reiterates your value and emphasizes the opportunity for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $12,200. That's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is right on the edge of your minimum acceptable price, and it's higher than what John is offering.  It's a good deal for you, and it's likely that Bob won't budge further.  There's no point in risking losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
