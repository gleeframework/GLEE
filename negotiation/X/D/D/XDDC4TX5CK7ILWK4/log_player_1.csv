"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and signals that you value the product highly.
* **Not Too High:** While aiming high,  $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than your walk-away price ($1,200,000 from John) and leaves space for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and aims for a ""win-win"" outcome, encouraging Bob to engage constructively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to only pay up to $950,000. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. We have plenty of room for negotiation and a strong alternative with John. Rejecting encourages Bob to move closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is considerably below what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and to make a deal work, I would need to see it closer to $1,050,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution in this range."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession, But Above Minimum:** We're making a substantial step down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, showing willingness to negotiate. However, we remain well above Bob's initial offer and firmly above our ""$1,200,000 guarantee"" from John.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value again reinforces our position that the price isn't arbitrary.
* **Guiding Toward Agreement:** The message implies flexibility within a range but firmly sets $1,050,000 as the current target, encouraging Bob to move significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $975,000 for this product. I hope this offer will be considered reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, the latest offer of $975,000 is still significantly below our desired outcome. We are willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product. We have the security of John's offer and can afford to nudge Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're making progress, but we're still a way off. To be frank, accepting anything below $1,020,000 would be leaving significant value on the table for me. If you can meet me at that price, I'm confident we can close this deal today."",
""product_price"": 1020000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness With Flexibility:**  This counteroffer signals a more assertive stance. We're reducing the price slightly but emphasizing that $1,020,000 is a firm bottom line.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""closing the deal today"" subtly introduces time pressure, potentially encouraging Bob to be more decisive.
* **Direct and Open:**  Using phrases like ""to be frank"" and ""leaving significant value on the table"" reinforces the seriousness of the offer and the need for Bob to make a substantial move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as a compromise. I hope this helps move us closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Favorable Price:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now within a range where accepting makes good business sense. While not our ideal target, it represents a strong profit over John's offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Prolonging negotiations further carries the risk of Bob disengaging or the deal falling apart.  Accepting now secures a good outcome.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner allows us to reinvest the capital or utilize it for other opportunities more quickly."
