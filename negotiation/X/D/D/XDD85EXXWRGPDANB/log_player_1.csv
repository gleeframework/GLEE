Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 150} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to your desired profit margin.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $120. While we want to make a profit, accepting such a low offer would be a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate, and John provides a safety net at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $80 is quite a bit lower than I can go. Could you do $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We're lowering our price by $35 from the initial offer, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate.  
* **Staying Above Minimum:** The $115 counteroffer keeps us comfortably above our $120 safety net (selling to John).
* **Encouraging a Counter:** This offer leaves room for Bob to potentially counter again while still giving us a reasonable profit if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm trying to keep my budget below $100.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $97.5? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Reach Agreement:** Bob is fixated on a price below $100, while we cannot go below $120. Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge this gap. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $120, which is a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of Bob completely walking away.

It's been a productive negotiation, but sometimes walking away to a guaranteed offer is the most profitable decision."
