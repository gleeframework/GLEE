"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $920000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the best price I can offer. I'm not willing to meet you halfway again, as I've already done so multiple times. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price.
