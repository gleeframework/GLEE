Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a significant value.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and still leaves me with a profit. It's time to close the deal."
