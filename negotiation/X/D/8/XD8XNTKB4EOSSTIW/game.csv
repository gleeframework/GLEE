"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable solution.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $98.  If you're genuinely interested in this product, I think this is a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Alice,5,
