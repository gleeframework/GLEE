"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Anchoring:**  By opening with $1,500,000, we set a high anchor point, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  We've left a significant margin between our asking price and both our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, it's still early in the negotiation. We have room to counter and try to secure a higher price.  We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,200,000 is a strong starting point, I believe this product holds even greater value for your business.  Would you consider $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We've come down from our initial offer, signaling flexibility, but we're still aiming for a price above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Justification:**  Instead of just throwing out a number, we're reiterating the product's value to Bob's business, subtly reinforcing its worth. 
* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer shows we're willing to negotiate, but we're not drastically dropping our price. We want to see how Bob responds and leave ourselves room for further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,300,000 is a good deal. It's a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000) and shows Bob is serious.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently moved towards our price, indicating a strong desire to purchase.
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal sooner rather than later reduces risk and uncertainty. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk pushing Bob away and potentially having to settle for John's offer."
