Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I aim to reach a price that is higher than Bob's $1,000,000 but below my $1,500,000 minimum, thus securing a good deal for myself.
* **Backup Plan:** I keep John as a backup, ensuring I can still sell the product at my minimum acceptable price if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might entice him while still ensuring I get a better price than his initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm raising Bob's offer by a modest amount,  demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a higher price than his initial offer.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a ""fair compromise,"" highlighting its benefits for both of us.
* **Positive Negotiation Tone:** My message maintains a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I value your product and appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,125,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is close to my last offer of $1,150,000.  
* **Risk of Loss:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away, leaving me with no buyer except John. 
* **Acceptable Price:** While not ideal, $1,125,000 is still above Bob's initial offer and is a decent return on the product. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation risks."
