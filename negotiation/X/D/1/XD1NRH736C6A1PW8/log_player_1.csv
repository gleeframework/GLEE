Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you'd accept $100 from John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a little extra profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just above Bob's perceived value ($80) but might entice him as a ""deal"" compared to an even higher number.
* **Time Sensitivity:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a touch of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a decision."
