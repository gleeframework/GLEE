"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer is still below our maximum budget of $10,000, allowing us to potentially increase the offer if needed.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating our price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John:** Alice's offer is still higher than John's price of $10,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, having moved from $12,000 to $11,000. We might be able to push for a lower price. 
* **Walk-Away Option:** We have the safety net of John's offer, so we're not desperate to accept a price we're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,000? That's the most I can offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Our Limit:** We're offering our maximum budget. This lets Alice know we're serious but have a firm limit.
* **Fair Compromise:**  We've moved up significantly from our initial offer, and this price point represents a compromise closer to the middle ground between our starting points.
* **John as Leverage:**  We haven't explicitly mentioned John, but Alice is likely aware we have other options. This offer subtly implies that if she rejects it, we might walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has essentially given her final offer. She's unwilling to meet our $10,000 limit.
* **Better Alternative:** We have the option to buy from John for $10,000, which saves us $1,500 compared to Alice's final offer.
* **No More Room:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap. Accepting Alice's offer means overpaying based on our budget and John's offer."
