"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
