(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
