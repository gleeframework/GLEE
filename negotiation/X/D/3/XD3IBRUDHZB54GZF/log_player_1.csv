"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a value closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $90 is close, but I think I can get closer to my target of $100 with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I think I can get to a price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my minimum of $100, we're only a few rounds away from running out of time, and $91 is a good price. It's better than selling to John for $100, and it's a fair compromise with Bob."
