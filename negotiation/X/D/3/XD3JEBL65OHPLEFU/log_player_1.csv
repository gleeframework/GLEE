Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the potential ROI and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value both of us can realize from this deal.
