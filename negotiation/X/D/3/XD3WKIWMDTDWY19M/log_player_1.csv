"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 price:** This price is a good starting point, as it's more than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly message:** A friendly and encouraging message sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

By starting with a reasonable price and a positive attitude, I aim to encourage Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects, I'll adjust my approach based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. Bob is clearly interested, so I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial offer. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've raised the price slightly from Bob's offer, but it's still lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Reasoning:** I've provided a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the value Bob will receive. This helps keep the negotiation respectful and constructive. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone keeps the conversation open and encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $92.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision. Holding out for a higher price might lead to a stalemate or a sale to John at a lower price.
* **Progress:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer represents a good compromise.

Accepting this offer ensures I make a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
