"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit, but I'm still within a range that might be appealing to Bob. 

I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I cannot accept this offer. I will reject it and proceed to the next round to see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is still above my minimum value of $12,000, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price will be appealing to Bob, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value just yet.  

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe I can achieve a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to $12,500. This is a further compromise, but it's still above my minimum value of $12,000. I'm hoping that this price will be acceptable to Bob, as I'm now only $500 above my floor. It's a small enough margin that I believe he may be willing to accept, especially as we're nearing the middle of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. However, we're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations.  I'm not yet ready to settle for a lower price than my minimum value. 

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I still have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm finally offering my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer, as we are now in the later stages of negotiations.  If he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John at the same price, as I have only 3 rounds left and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. We only have two rounds left, and I'm not confident that I can get him to agree to my minimum price.  It's better to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $12,000, which at least guarantees I get my minimum value."
