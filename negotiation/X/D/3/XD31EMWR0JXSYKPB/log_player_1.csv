Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product."", ""product_price"": 11500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I still feel there's room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something closer to $11,500."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,750 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $11,000.  This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation is diminishing with each round. It's also better than selling to John for $10,000."
