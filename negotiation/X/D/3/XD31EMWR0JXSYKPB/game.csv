"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can work out a deal that benefits us both.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,750 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $11,000.  This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on this.",11000.0,Bob,6,
