"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity to own a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal by counteroffering. There's no need to rush into a decision this early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product, but only if it's in excellent condition. Let me know if you're interested in exploring that price point."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $820000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's moving in the right direction.  I'll counter again to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm not willing to accept her offer yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I value the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $820,000 is still above my comfortable price range.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000, which represents a fair compromise. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $785000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $785,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but it's still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to counter again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I have a few rounds left, so I'm not desperate to make a decision right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm happy to see us closing the gap, $785,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $760,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal at this price point."", ""product_price"": 760000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to go down to $760000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $780000. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to pay less, Alice's offer of $780,000 is getting very close to my ideal price. We're at a point where it's likely she won't budge further.  I only have a few rounds left, and buying from John would be significantly more expensive. Therefore, accepting this offer is the most financially sensible decision."
