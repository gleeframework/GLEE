"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of this item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is far too high. It's significantly more than I'm willing to pay and even above my walk-away price from John. A counteroffer is necessary to bring the negotiation closer to a realistic range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While it seems interesting, $20,000 is quite steep. I'm thinking closer to $8,000 would be a more reasonable starting point.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:**  A low initial counteroffer aims to shift the negotiation dynamics significantly. 
* **Leaving room to negotiate:** Offering $8,000 allows for upward movement while staying well below my $12,000 maximum. This strategy aims to explore Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but firm:** The message maintains a courteous tone while clearly signaling that the initial price is unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $8,000 is significantly lower than what I have in mind. Could you consider something closer to $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice moved from her initial price, $18,000 is still significantly more than my $12,000 walk-away price. 
* **Slow concession:**  Her counteroffer suggests she might not be willing to move substantially lower.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation allows me to gauge her flexibility further without committing to a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground.  However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  To be candid, $10,000 is the absolute highest I could consider at this point. It reflects the value I see in the product, and I hope we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased offer, but within limits:** Moving to $10,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying below my $12,000 walk-away point.
* **Transparency and firmness:**  The message clearly states my top price, emphasizing that this is my limit.
* **Encouraging a deal:**  The language remains positive and expresses a continued interest in reaching an agreement, prompting Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to move down to $16,000 for a quick and mutually beneficial deal. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer and limited progress:** Alice declared her $16,000 offer as final, and it's still significantly higher than John's $12,000 price. 
* **Unlikely to negotiate further:**  Her mention of other buyers suggests she might be less willing to drop her price.
* **Secure a better deal:**  Buying from John guarantees the product at my desired price, avoiding the risk of Alice not budging any further."
