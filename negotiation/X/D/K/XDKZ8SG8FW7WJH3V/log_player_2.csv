"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount of money. While I can't disclose specifics, I can assure you its value is far beyond the price I'm asking. I'm offering it to you for $1750000. This is a chance to secure a potentially very valuable asset.  Consider it carefully, as I have another buyer lined up if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.
