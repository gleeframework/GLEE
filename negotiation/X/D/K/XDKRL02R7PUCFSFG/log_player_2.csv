"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's offer of $100.
* However, the product is only worth $80 to Alice. 
* This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially get a lower price from her or negotiate with John."
