"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I'm definitely interested, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,625.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I believe this product holds.",8625.0,Bob,4,
