"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $12,000. I think it's a great value for the quality and features it offers, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is much too high. It's well above your maximum budget and significantly more than John's offer.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is quite high. I'm interested in the product but could only consider a price closer to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, it establishes a strong negotiating position. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer gives you space to gradually increase your offer while staying well below your $8,000 maximum.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:**  Alice's response to this counteroffer will give you valuable insight into how willing she is to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice met you halfway, $9,000 is still above your $8,000 maximum budget. 
* **John's Offer is Better:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $8,000 from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially if you signal that you're considering other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price.  However, $9,000 is still more than I had budgeted for this purchase. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 to get this done today. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer is still below your maximum budget but shows movement towards Alice's price. 
* **Introducing Competition (John):** By mentioning ""other options,"" you subtly remind Alice about John's offer, which puts a little bit of pressure on her to make a deal.
* **Clear Call to Action:** You're giving Alice a clear choice: accept $7,000 or potentially lose the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has explicitly stated that $8,200 is her lowest price.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000, which saves you $200 compared to Alice's final offer.
* **No More Room to Negotiate:** Continuing the negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you'd prefer over John's offer. 

It's been a good negotiation, but sometimes it's best to walk away when you have a better deal elsewhere!"
