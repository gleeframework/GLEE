"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand you have budget considerations.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could you do $13,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
