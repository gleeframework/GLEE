"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects my commitment to working with you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop the price to $825,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
