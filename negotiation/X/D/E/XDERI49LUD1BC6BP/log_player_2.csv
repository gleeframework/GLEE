Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** 

While Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, there's still room to negotiate further.  Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and has been steadily lowering the price. It's worth trying to see if Alice will accept a price closer to Bob's ideal.  A counteroffer might be a better strategy to save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:** 

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  At this point, it's better to buy from John and save $250,000.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get the price significantly lower, and it's not worth the risk of wasting more time."
