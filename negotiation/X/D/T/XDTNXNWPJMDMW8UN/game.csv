"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at $1,200,000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, the price you're asking is quite high. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's potential and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for moving closer to a price we can both agree on.  How about $900,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 still doesn't reflect the full value of this product. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $950,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our interests and allows for a successful transaction.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting close to a price I can agree to.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. Let's close this deal!",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $937,500.  This price is a fair compromise and ensures we both walk away satisfied with the transaction.",937500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I need you to be reasonable on the price.  My final offer is $930,000.  If you can't agree to that, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",930000.0,Bob,8,
