"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $6,500 is still a bit high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $5,500.  This represents a significant discount and reflects my understanding of its value to me. What do you think?",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $5,500 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value you've placed on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $6,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",6000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $6,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $5,750? This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our perspectives. Let's find common ground here.",5750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I understand that $5,750 is still a bit above your target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'll offer it to you for $5,900. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",5900.0,Alice,5,
