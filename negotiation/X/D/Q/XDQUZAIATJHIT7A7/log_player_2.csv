"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  Let me know your decision. I'm also in talks with another buyer who is willing to pay $1,200,000, so you'll need to act fast if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to get the product from John for $1,000,000, saving him $100,000."
