"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you can't go as low as $11,000 Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
