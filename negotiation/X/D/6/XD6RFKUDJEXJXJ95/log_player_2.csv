"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is too high. We can definitely try to negotiate a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This leaves us room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and expresses our interest while still clearly stating our budget limitations.

This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and move the negotiation closer to a price point that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our ideal price point of $10,000. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as we won't get a better deal."
