"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but the value of this product significantly exceeds that.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's work towards a deal that's fair for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, it's still under what I can accept. My final offer is $1,600,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.  ",1600000.0,Alice,5,
