"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is way too high.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best move at this stage."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but the value of this product significantly exceeds that.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,900,000 is still well above my budget.  I'll counter with a lower offer and see if we can get closer to my target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's work towards a deal that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, it's still under what I can accept. My final offer is $1,600,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:

While $1,600,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still over my limit. At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
