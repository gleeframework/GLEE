Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. Considering its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a little.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** The offer is close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), making it more likely he'll engage in the negotiation.
* **Safety Net:**  We have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000, ensuring we won't be forced to accept anything below that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is already above our minimum acceptable price from John ($1,000,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate between Bob's offer and his perceived value of $1,200,000. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, we can gauge how serious Bob is about the purchase and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, the value of this product is significant. I could meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This is a fair offer considering its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach often feels like a compromise to both parties, making it more palatable.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We're still above our minimum and signaling that we're serious about a price closer to our initial offer.
* **Clear Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price we're asking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. Let's do this, I'll offer $1,075,000 and that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,075,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price and a good deal overall.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's language suggests this is likely his best offer, and further negotiation might lead to him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations comes with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether. Accepting now secures a good deal immediately."
