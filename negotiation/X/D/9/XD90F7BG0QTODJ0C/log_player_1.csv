Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, $97.50 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  While I'd like to get more, Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  At this point, selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value, and saves me from further negotiation."
