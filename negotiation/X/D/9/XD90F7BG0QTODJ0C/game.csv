"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, $97.50 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $101.25? This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $101.25. I'm willing to go up to $99, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",99.0,Bob,6,
