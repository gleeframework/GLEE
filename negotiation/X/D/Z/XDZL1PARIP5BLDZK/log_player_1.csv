Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to aim for a price significantly higher than that, but not so high that he automatically rejects it. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so our offer to Bob should be close to that price.
* **Psychological Pricing:** Offering the product at slightly below $15,000 ($14,999) creates a sense of urgency and might make Bob perceive the deal as more attractive.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, by starting high and leaving room for negotiation, we maximize our chances of securing a better price than our guaranteed sale to John."
