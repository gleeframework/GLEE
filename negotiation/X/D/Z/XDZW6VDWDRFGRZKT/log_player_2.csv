"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $150, which is your maximum budget. 
* **Strategy:** There's a chance Alice is willing to sell for less, so it's worth negotiating. 

By rejecting, I can see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a significant discount (20% off) from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to see how flexible Alice is. If she accepts this, I've saved a good amount. If she rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $140, which is still within my budget but not the best deal. 
* **Strategy:** I'm still hopeful that I can get a lower price. 

I'll reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's previous offer:** $140.
* **My goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Strategy:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating willingness to compromise but also signaling that I'm not willing to pay Alice's full asking price. This is a more subtle approach than a larger jump, and I'm hoping it encourages her to consider a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $135.
* **My Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Strategy:**  We're getting close to my ideal price.  It's worth considering accepting this offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of further negotiations failing and having to buy from John at $150 isn't worth it.  

I'm happy to save $15 by accepting Alice's offer."
