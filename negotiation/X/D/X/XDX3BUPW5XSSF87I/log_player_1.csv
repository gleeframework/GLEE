"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $2,300,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, considering its potential value. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,700,000 is a strong offer, the product's unique value justifies a higher price. Would you consider $2,100,000? This allows both of us to benefit from this transaction."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is unique, but $2,100,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,700,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget.  Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems firm on $1,700,000, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to nudge him a bit higher one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firm stance and willingness to find a solution. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,800,000, which is a fair compromise. This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has consistently moved upward in his offers, signaling genuine interest. While $1,800,000 is less than my initial target, it's a significant profit above my minimum. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's price in later rounds."
