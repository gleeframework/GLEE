"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $2,300,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, considering its potential value. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,700,000 is a strong offer, the product's unique value justifies a higher price. Would you consider $2,100,000? This allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is unique, but $2,100,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,700,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your firm stance and willingness to find a solution. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,800,000, which is a fair compromise. This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
