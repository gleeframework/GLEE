"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what's best for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I'm starting significantly higher to allow for negotiation. This leaves me room to come down while still aiming for a price well above my minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** My message conveys the product's value and my belief in its worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I don't want to scare Bob off.  By stating I'm ""open to discussing,"" I signal flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'd need a much lower price to make it worthwhile. How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. While I want to negotiate, accepting such a low offer would leave a lot of money on the table.  I'll make a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a realistic range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Explanation:** I don't simply dismiss Bob's offer but provide a reason that emphasizes value.
* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** My counteroffer drops by $250,000, signaling flexibility, but keeps the price well above my $1,200,000 floor and closer to my initial offer.
* **Framing as Compromise:** I highlight that this price is a concession on my part, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but we're still quite a ways off.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, but that's about as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some movement by increasing his offer, $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see him making more significant concessions. I'll continue the negotiation in the hopes that he'll move closer to my range, but I'll also be prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to continue this discussion. I understand that we both have our limits, but the gap between our positions is still substantial.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects my commitment to reaching a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I recognize Bob's increasing offers, showing him I'm paying attention and appreciating his efforts.
* **""Meeting Halfway"":** This phrasing aims to appeal to fairness and encourage reciprocity. While not precisely halfway, it frames the counteroffer as a significant concession on my end.
* **Firmness on Value:** I reiterate the product's worth, subtly reminding Bob that my willingness to negotiate doesn't diminish its value. 
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is close to my absolute minimum. I'm pushing for Bob to make a substantial move if he's truly interested. If he doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round or two, I'll likely walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, that price is still a bit too rich for me.  I could stretch to $1,050,000, but that's really pushing my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. While he's making small increases, his latest offer of $1,050,000 suggests he's unlikely to meet my valuation in the remaining rounds.  

It's time to cut my losses. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is both my minimum and a better outcome than what seems likely with Bob.  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of the negotiation failing altogether, leaving me with nothing."
