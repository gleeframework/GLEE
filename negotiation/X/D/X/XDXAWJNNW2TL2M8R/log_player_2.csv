"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $10,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer in the next round."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $12,500 is still too high for Bob.  He's aiming to get the price closer to his $11,000 counteroffer. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if they can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $12,250. This is as low as I can go without losing my profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down further, $12,250 is still a bit too high for Bob. He's trying to get the price as close to his $11,000 counteroffer as possible. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth another round to see if they can agree."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a compromise. I understand you have a profit margin to maintain, but $12,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $11,500. I'll make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $12,750. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice's latest offer of $12,750 is still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He's already made several counteroffers and reached his limit. Given that there are only 3 rounds left, the chances of Alice coming down to his desired price are slim. 

To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on the deal entirely, Bob decides to buy the product from John for $15,000. While it's not his ideal price, it's still within his budget and ensures he gets the product."
