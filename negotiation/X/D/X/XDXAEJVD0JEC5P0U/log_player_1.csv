Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$100 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. $110 is better than selling to John for $120."
