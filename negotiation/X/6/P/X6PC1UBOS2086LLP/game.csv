"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value to both of us, I believe a price of $1,350,000 would be fair. This allows for a comfortable margin for both parties. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,350,000. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000? I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I value your interest, a price of $1,000,000 unfortunately doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To find a mutually beneficial solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to working with you. Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $1,150,000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 still falls short of the value I've placed on this product. To bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable return. ",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position, but I must respectfully decline at $1,100,000. I am still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. In light of this, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
