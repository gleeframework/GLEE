"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product and my limited budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm offering the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I've decided to go with another seller who has offered the product for $10000. Thank you for your time and consideration.",0.0,Bob,6,
