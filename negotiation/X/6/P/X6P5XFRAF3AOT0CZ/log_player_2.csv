Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer for now.

It seems like Alice is not budging much on her price. It's unlikely she'll go below $800,000, and at this point, it's more beneficial to go with the guaranteed deal from John."
