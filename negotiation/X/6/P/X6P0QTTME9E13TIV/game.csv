,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975000. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1075000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the deadline, Bob. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1025000. If you're willing to meet me here, I think we can make a deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting concerned about the deadline, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1025000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $997500. If you're willing to accept this, I think we can make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",997500.0,Bob,10,
