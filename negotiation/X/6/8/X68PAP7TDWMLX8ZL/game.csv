"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $15,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $13,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget, but $13,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be interested in paying $13,500? This would be a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
