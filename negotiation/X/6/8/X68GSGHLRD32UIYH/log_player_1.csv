Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's really interested. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is only worth $80 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as a good deal or needs it urgently.  

**Important:** It's crucial to strike a balance between a price that's enticing for Bob while still ensuring you maximize your potential earnings."
