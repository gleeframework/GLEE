"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You can get the product for $100 from John, so you have room to negotiate with Alice.
* **You want to see if Alice is willing to go lower.**  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget.** This offer is still above your maximum, but it leaves room for Alice to counter without going below her minimum.
* **This signals you're serious about negotiating.**  It shows Alice you're not just going to accept the first offer. 
* **You're aiming for a compromise.**  $75 is likely a price Alice will consider, as it's closer to her value of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $90 is still less than what you'd pay John.
* **It's unlikely you'll get a better deal.** Alice has already rejected your counteroffer, showing she's willing to hold firm. 
* **Time is a factor.** You only have 10 rounds, and it's better to secure a decent deal than risk getting stuck with John's price."
