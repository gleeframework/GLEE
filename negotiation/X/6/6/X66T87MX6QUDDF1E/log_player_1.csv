Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum price of $10,000. Since Bob values the product at $8,000, he's unlikely to accept this offer right away. This gives me an opportunity to see if he's truly interested and also allows me to gauge his potential counteroffer. If he rejects, I can then consider negotiating further or selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,750. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. This counteroffer allows me to potentially secure a deal closer to my preferred value while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting further away from my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  Given the risk of further counteroffers potentially dropping the price even lower, I'm going to sell to John for my minimum price of $10,000. This guarantees I get the value I'm comfortable with and minimizes the risk of a lower sale."
