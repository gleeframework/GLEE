Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you could start higher, offering $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** This price point aims to maximize your chances of a sale to Bob (and a higher profit) while still ensuring you get a decent price from John if Bob declines."
