Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy Alice should use, followed by the offer:

**Strategy:**

* **Alice's Power:** Alice has a strong position. She knows John will buy the product for her minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This means she doesn't have to settle for anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  Alice needs to offer a price lower than this for Bob to even consider accepting.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Alice should aim for a price that's significantly higher than her minimum but still attractive to Bob. 

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this unique product. I'm prepared to make this deal happen for $850,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts positively, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $850,000 is a price that:
    * Allows Alice to potentially make a profit of $50,000 over her guaranteed sale to John.
    * Gives Bob a good deal, saving him $150,000 off his perceived value.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $850,000. He might try to negotiate a lower price. Alice needs to be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet her near her desired price point."
