"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is my maximum price. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150.  This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $150 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about $125?  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident we can close this quickly.",125.0,Bob,4,
