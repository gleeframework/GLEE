"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, $15000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway on this. ",17500.0,Alice,3,
