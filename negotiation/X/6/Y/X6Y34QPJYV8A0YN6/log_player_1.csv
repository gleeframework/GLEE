Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $9,000, there's room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to me, implying it's worth even more than the asking price.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While I'm trying to get the best price from Bob, I'm aware I have a backup option with John, so I won't be pressured into accepting a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's initial counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation. I can try to meet him halfway.
* **Keeping John as a safety net:** I'm not desperate for a sale. I know I can sell to John for $10,000, so I'm willing to take a risk and try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This reflects the value of the product to me, and it's still a great price for you."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to me to try and justify the price.
* **Staying firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going below $8,500, as I'm confident I can sell to John for $10,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Negotiation is getting harder:** Each round, the gap between our desired prices is shrinking.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm running out of room to compromise. 
* **Weighing the risk:** I'm close to John's offer of $10,000. If I reject Bob's offer again, I'm taking a risk that Bob will either walk away or offer a price that's too low. 
* **Trying for a final push:** I'll make one final counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible.  $7,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making this my final offer, indicating a sense of urgency. 
* **Slight compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Implied consequence:** I'm letting Bob know that if he doesn't accept, I'll move on to John."
