# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,050,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,025,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will not budge much more.  Accepting her offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
