"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,025,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
