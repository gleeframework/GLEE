"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $920,000?",920000.0,Bob,4,
