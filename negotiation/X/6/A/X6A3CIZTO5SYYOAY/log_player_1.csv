Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I think I can do better with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about $130? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 130}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $130, $125 is a good price and is worth more than selling to John."
