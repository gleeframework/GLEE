"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're willing to come down to $1100000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950000. Can we agree on that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1050000. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
