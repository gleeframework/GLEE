"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but $80 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I can meet you at $110. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $110.  I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, which is closer to my minimum price of $120. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",112.5,Alice,7,
