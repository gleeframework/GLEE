"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making it more likely Bob will consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $1,700,000 is a starting point. I expect Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1700000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe I can get a better price from Bob or potentially John.
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary. This can put pressure on him to improve his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Close to My Minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still higher than my minimum but shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm acknowledging Bob's interest and looking for a compromise, avoiding a confrontational approach.
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes finding a deal that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Running Out of Rounds:**  We're already on round 4, and while I can continue to negotiate, there's a risk that I won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my best guaranteed option at this point. While it's not ideal to not maximize profit, it secures the minimum I need. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's still a chance Bob might come back with a more acceptable offer, but I need to balance that with the risk of losing time and ultimately ending up with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but $1,100,000 just isn't working for me.  To make this deal happen, I need to be at $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product at this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  $1,300,000 is a final attempt to meet Bob halfway. It's still a good profit for me, and hopefully, Bob sees the value in securing the product at this price.
* **Emphasize Compromise:**  The message reinforces the idea that this is a compromise and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Pressure to Close:**  This is my last counteroffer before considering John's offer.  I need to make it clear that I'm serious about closing this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Unacceptable:**  $1,050,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Time:** We're now on round 6, leaving only four rounds remaining. There's a high risk that I won't be able to negotiate a satisfactory price with Bob within the limited time.
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates any further negotiation risk.  It's the safest and most financially secure option at this point. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While I would have preferred to get closer to my ideal price, the guaranteed sale to John ensures that I don't walk away with nothing. This also allows me to potentially explore other deals in the future."
