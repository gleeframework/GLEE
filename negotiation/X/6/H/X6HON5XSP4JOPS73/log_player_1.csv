{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $9,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial price and a fair offer considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more than $9,000.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."

``` 

Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to John's offer of $8,000.  I'm not confident I can get Bob to go higher and I'm running out of rounds.  I'll go with the sure thing and sell to John."
