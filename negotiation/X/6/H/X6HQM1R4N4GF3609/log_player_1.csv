Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already getting a good price.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $14,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for some give-and-take in the negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind the potential deal with John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I will try to counteroffer with a price that is closer to my desired price while still remaining attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500?  It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Remains above my minimum:**  $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Shows flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and come down from my initial price.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** This offer allows for further discussion and potential compromise if Bob wants to counteroffer again. 

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will need to carefully consider whether to accept his next counteroffer or if I should sell the product to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with an even lower offer.  I'm confident I can sell to John for $12,000, so I will choose to sell the product to John."
