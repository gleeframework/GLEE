"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum budget of $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's early in the process.**  You have 9 more rounds to get a better deal.  There's no need to rush.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  You know you can always buy from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth and provides a win-win scenario for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  It's closer to your desired price, but you can likely get it lower. 
* **You have 7 rounds left.**  There's still time to negotiate further.
* **John's offer is always a backup.**  You're in a good position to play the long game."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, and I respect that. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. I've already moved considerably from my initial proposal. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000 – that's my final offer.  I need to make a decision quickly, as I have other potential buyers interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** It's higher than your last counteroffer, but it's still a good deal for you. 
* **You're running out of time.** With only 5 rounds left, you risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether.
* **John's offer is a safety net, but not ideal.**  While you can always go to John, you'd be paying significantly more.

By accepting Alice's offer, you secure the product at a decent price while avoiding the risk of a stalemate or a higher price from John."
