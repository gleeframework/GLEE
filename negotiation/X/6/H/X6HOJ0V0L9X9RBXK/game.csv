"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth and provides a win-win scenario for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's make it happen.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, and I respect that. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. I've already moved considerably from my initial proposal. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000 – that's my final offer.  I need to make a decision quickly, as I have other potential buyers interested.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
