Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I truly believe in its value and I'm confident it will be worth it for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you should never accept anything less than that from Bob.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price and make it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on limited information.  In a real negotiation, understanding Bob's needs, motivations, and potential alternatives would be crucial for crafting a more effective offer."
