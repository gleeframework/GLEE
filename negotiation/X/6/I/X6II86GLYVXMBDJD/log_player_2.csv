"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While it's closer, you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal without risking buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you at $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, and while you're getting closer, there's no guarantee you'll be able to get it lower. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within your budget and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
