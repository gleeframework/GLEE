"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you at $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
