"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $9,500?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $10,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
