"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a good starting point.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $8,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum. I believe this is a fair compromise given Bob's low counteroffer. I'm hoping to reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum.  I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'll try to meet Bob halfway in my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is only $500 below my minimum but I'm hoping that Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise. I'm running out of rounds and I want to make sure I get a good price, but I'm also trying to be flexible to avoid losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally met my minimum price. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him. While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing negotiations, I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure a deal than risk losing the sale to John."
