{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  I will reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still within the range I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but I'd prefer to pay less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $7,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. I hope this shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still asking too much. I'm going to reject her offer and see if we can reach a deal closer to my limit. I'm not sure how many rounds I have left, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit more before I buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to make my final counteroffer of $8,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but if she doesn't, I'll buy from John."
