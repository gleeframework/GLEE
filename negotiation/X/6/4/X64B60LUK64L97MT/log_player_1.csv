{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving him a good reason to negotiate. However, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $1,000,000, allowing for some room to compromise.  It also leaves you with a potential fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and get a price closer to my desired amount."

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
