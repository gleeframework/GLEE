Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately far below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant price reduction and reflects a genuine desire to work with you. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $800,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us much closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, it's clear she's still aiming for a significantly higher amount than your alternative. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when you can secure the product at your target price right now."
