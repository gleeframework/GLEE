Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product. Let's close this deal. How about $110? It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to go much lower than $110. Buying from John for $100 guarantees the best price and avoids further negotiation."
