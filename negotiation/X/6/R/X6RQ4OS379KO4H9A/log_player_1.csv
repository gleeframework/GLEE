Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $100 but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $130. While it's closer to my minimum price than his initial rejection, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $135. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $132. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than John's offer and still above my minimum.  I'm confident that I've reached a reasonable price point and don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
