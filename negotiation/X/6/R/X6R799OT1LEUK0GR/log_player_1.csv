"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a real game-changer, and I believe it can be incredibly valuable for you. My initial price is $11,500. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $10,200 is better than selling to John for $10,000, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  Bob is clearly interested and we have several rounds left to negotiate.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below my desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it leaves some room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,600?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $10,600 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. We have several rounds remaining, and I'm confident we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you to find a good price.  I'm willing to go down to $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of this product for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $10,700.  Do you think that would work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,700 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and above what I would get from John.  It's likely that Bob will not budge further, so I'm accepting his offer to close the deal."
