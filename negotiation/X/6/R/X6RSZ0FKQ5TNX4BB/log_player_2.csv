"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to get a fair price for it. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation of the product. It makes the most sense to go with your alternative option and buy from John for $80."
