``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,700,000. This is a price higher than his perceived value but lower than my absolute minimum. This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum price. John is offering a price that meets my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him."
