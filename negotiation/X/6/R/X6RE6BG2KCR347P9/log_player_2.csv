"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value and quality, it's worth noting that this item holds a significant importance to me. However, I understand the unique perspective you bring to its worth, as you see it valued at $12,000. Considering this, I would like to extend an offer to you at a price of $11,000. This offer is designed to be mutually beneficial, allowing you to secure an item of such high value while also ensuring a fair return for my investment. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $10,000.  You have a better alternative: John is willing to sell you the product for $12,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away.  This might lead her to propose a better offer. If not, you're still within your budget by purchasing from John."
