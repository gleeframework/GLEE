Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very stubbornly sticking to increments well below what we're willing to accept. He's  unlikely to significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk Bob not reaching a satisfactory price."
