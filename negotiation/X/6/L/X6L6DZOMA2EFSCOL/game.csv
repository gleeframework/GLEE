"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product is definitely interesting, but I was hoping for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $725,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $725,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $680,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",680000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $680,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more adjustment. How about we meet at $700,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I think it's a reasonable compromise.",700000.0,Alice,5,
