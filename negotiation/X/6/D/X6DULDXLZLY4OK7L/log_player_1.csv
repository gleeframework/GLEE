Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a price that is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, as it is lower than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer. While it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it is very close and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  $9,200 is a reasonable price considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and my desire to close the deal."
