"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. He has room to negotiate a lower price.  It's better to see if Alice will come down in price rather than accept her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $13,000 for the product. This is still below his maximum budget and is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,750 is still above Bob's ideal price point. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to get closer to his target of $13,000.  He's not desperate enough to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $13,500.  This is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's last offer. It shows Bob is willing to meet halfway and is eager to close the deal. This price is still below his maximum budget and gives Alice some room to accept while still leaving Bob with a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now matched Bob's counteroffer from the previous round. This means Bob has achieved his goal of getting the product for $13,500, which is a good price for him.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially get a worse deal, or to spend more with John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
