"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $150 to make this worthwhile.  Would you be open to $155?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $130 is still too low.  I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $130 is still not a price I can work with. I'm willing to go a little lower than my previous offer, but $145 is the absolute minimum I can accept. Let me know if you're interested at this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $137.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $137.50 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $142.50 for this final offer. This is really the best I can do, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 142.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting frustrating. I'm not willing to go lower than $140, and Bob seems stuck at $135. It's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $150."
