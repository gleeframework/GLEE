"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's asking price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** I maintain a polite and interested tone to encourage further negotiation. I don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away.
* **Strategic Positioning:** While I have the option to buy from John for $10,000, I'm aiming lower to see if I can secure an even better price from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my alternative price. There's no benefit to haggling further or buying from John, as they both offer the product at $10,000."
