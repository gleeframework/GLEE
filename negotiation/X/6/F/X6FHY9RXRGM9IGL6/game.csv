"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
