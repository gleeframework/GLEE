"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $700,000.  Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $700,000 is still too far off from my target price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
