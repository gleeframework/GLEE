"Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8000.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than you'd like to spend, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise at $11500. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
