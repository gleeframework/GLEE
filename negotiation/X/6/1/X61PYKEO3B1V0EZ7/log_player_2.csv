{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's much too early to buy from Alice at that price. There's a lot of room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $500,000 is a substantial drop from her initial price, and it leaves a good amount of room for compromise."

While $650,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high. I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming up with a counter offer which is higher than the last round.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to get into a bidding war. I'll keep my counteroffer at $600,000 and see if she changes her mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm sticking with my counteroffer of $600,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Alice is probably trying to test my resolve, but I'm not budging."

Alice keeps increasing her offer, but it's still too high. I'm not going to give in to pressure. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to show Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a lower price.  $650,000 is a good compromise between our previous offers, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal this round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation and Alice seems unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,500,000, ensuring I get the product without risking running out of rounds and ending up with no deal."
