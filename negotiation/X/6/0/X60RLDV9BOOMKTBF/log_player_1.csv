"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $85 is lower than my initial asking price, but still higher than the minimum value of $80 that the product has to me. I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer, making a new counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer: The product price will be $87.
