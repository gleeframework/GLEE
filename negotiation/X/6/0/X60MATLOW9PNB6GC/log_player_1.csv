Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""incredible value"" and ""unique opportunity"" to justify a price higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land a deal significantly above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob knows your bottom line, this approach could backfire."
