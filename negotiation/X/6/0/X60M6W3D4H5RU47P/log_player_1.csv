Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so $900,000 gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's overpaying.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You value the product at $1,000,000, so you're still leaving yourself some wiggle room.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This avoids confusion and sets the tone for a professional negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can either lower your price slightly or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your minimum value of $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better price from Bob. You can counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than your initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while keeping the price closer to your minimum value.
* **Reasoning:** The message explains why the counteroffer is reasonable, referencing the product's value. This helps maintain a professional and respectful negotiation.

Remember, you can adjust your counteroffers based on how Bob responds. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, you can make another counteroffer or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider this price again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stuck to his price of $850,000, which is still below your minimum. While you could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Bob isn't willing to budge significantly.  

Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees you your minimum value and saves you time and energy on further negotiation."
