Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $12,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000.  Offering it slightly below our guaranteed price maximizes the chance Bob accepts while still securing a profit above his valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we want to be close to our minimum, starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested. This keeps the door open for a potentially higher sale price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and asks for Bob's opinion, making him feel like he's part of the decision process."
