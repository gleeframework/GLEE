"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1800000. This is a significant opportunity for you to secure a valuable asset at a potentially advantageous price.  Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I have another interested buyer who is ready to pay $1500000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,800,000, which is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Since you can buy the same product from John for $1,500,000, it's more financially beneficial to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
