"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
