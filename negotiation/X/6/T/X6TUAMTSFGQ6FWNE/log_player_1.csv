{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $13,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to accept it."
