"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  While I understand it holds value for you, I'm confident it's worth more. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could go up to $1,100,000. I believe that's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to come up. However,  $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is a final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I will have to explore other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
