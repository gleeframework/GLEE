Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.

Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could go up to $1,100,000. I believe that's a reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can find common ground."
