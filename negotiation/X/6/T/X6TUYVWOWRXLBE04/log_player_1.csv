"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully incentivizes Bob to engage.  I believe this price is high enough to be attractive to Bob, considering his valuation of $8,000, but low enough to leave room for me to potentially increase the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, it's still significantly less.  There's room for further negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price.  Selling to John right now is the safest option, but I'm going to try to leverage Bob's interest and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising the price slightly to $10,500.  This is a compromise, but still a good deal for Bob, given his valuation of $8,000.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's attractive to both of us.  The goal is to keep the negotiation moving and see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is now very close to my desired price.  While I would love to get $10,000 or more, I'm running the risk of the deal falling apart completely.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm seeing a good opportunity to close this deal with Bob and avoid losing out on any potential profit."
