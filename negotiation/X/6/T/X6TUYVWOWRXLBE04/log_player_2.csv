"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price from Alice or to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. $9,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $12,000, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to negotiate a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price or to go with John's offer, which is within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $10,500.  $9,500 is still a bit above his budget, but it's getting closer to a deal that both parties might find acceptable.  This counteroffer also shows that Bob is willing to compromise but is still trying to get a better price."
