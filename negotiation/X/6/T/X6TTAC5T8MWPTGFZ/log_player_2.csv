"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's getting closer, this is the last round of negotiations before Bob has to make a decision. There is no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower offer in the next round. 

Since Bob can purchase the product from John for $1,200,000, it's in his best interest to accept John's offer and secure the product at his maximum price point. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations failing."
