{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really enjoy. I'm asking $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By explicitly saying I'm open to negotiation, I show flexibility and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, which helps build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. Based on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $150 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:**  Bob's offer is my absolute minimum price. Accepting it would mean no profit.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** While I don't know Bob's true valuation, there's a chance I can get a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale to John:**  Selling to John now would guarantee $150, but it's worth exploring the possibility of a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $200 but still below his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $175 for the product.  This reflects the high quality and value you'll get. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price by $25, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:**  I provide a reason for the price, highlighting the product's quality and value to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial $200, but still below Bob's stated budget.
* The counteroffer is a compromise that should make Bob more likely to accept, while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $160 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $160 is only $10 less than my desired price of $175. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering again could lead to a stalemate or a lower price. 
* **Guarantee Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $10, which is better than the minimum profit of $0 from selling to John.

**Conclusion:** Given the current situation, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that guarantees a profit. Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also carries the risk of no sale at all."
