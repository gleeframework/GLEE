Alice's offer is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price. It's worth trying to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  It's a fair compromise and I'd be happy to buy the product at that price."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $112.50. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115, which is just a slight adjustment from my previous offer. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price.  While it is closer, I've only got 5 rounds left. If I keep going back and forth I might not be able to close the deal at all. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John, as it's already at my maximum price."
