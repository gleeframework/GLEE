Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $180, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher price point.  Even if Bob rejects the offer, his counteroffer is likely to be influenced by this initial high number. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 

It's important to remember that I (Alice) always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $120. This knowledge empowers me to be firm in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your item, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is a decent profit, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I value the product higher and am willing to walk away if necessary.  This keeps the door open for a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $165? That's a very fair price for this quality."", ""product_price"": 165}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Compromise:**  I've lowered my price by $15, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer is a common negotiation tactic, often perceived as fair.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's quality subtly reminds Bob of its worth.

I'm still aiming higher than Bob's offer while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe I can find the product elsewhere for less. I would like to propose a price of $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** While not ideal, $140 is still a $20 profit over my guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments, with the risk of Bob walking away entirely.  
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now avoids further back-and-forth, allowing me to move on to other potential sales. 

It's often better to secure a good profit than to risk losing a sale by being too rigid in negotiations."
