"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $7,500?  I'm confident this product is worth that to me, and it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range where a deal is possible. This sets a firm negotiating stance while also showing willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,250? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $8,000. While it is closer, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay right now.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $8,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum budget while demonstrating a willingness to come closer to Alice's price.  This counteroffer could be enough to secure the deal, or it might lead to further negotiation."
