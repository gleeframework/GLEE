"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $7,500?  I'm confident this product is worth that to me, and it's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,250? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay right now.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $8,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
