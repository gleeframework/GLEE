"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good deal, you can likely get it for even less.  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This is a significant price drop from her initial offer, but still within a range where a deal could be made.  If she rejects this, I'll adjust my offers in the following rounds based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly from the previous round, but it's still above my target price of $10,000. I'm still willing to negotiate and see if I can get her closer to my target.  There's still room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still trying to keep the price below my maximum limit. It's a compromise that might be acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but it's still a little high. I'm not willing to accept it just yet, as there's still a chance we can reach a deal that's even better for me.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice that I'm serious about a deal and I'm willing to meet her halfway. This price is still a good deal for me and it's more likely that she'll accept this offer.  If she doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still above my target. I'm committed to getting the best possible deal and believe there's still room for negotiation.  There's no guarantee John will still be willing to sell me the product in later rounds, but I want to exhaust all options with Alice before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a final push for a deal. It's very close to Alice's last offer and a good compromise.  I'm confident she'll accept it given that we're both getting closer to our desired prices. If she rejects this offer, I'll have to strongly consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price, and with only one round left, the chances of negotiating further are slim. I'm not willing to pay $9,400, especially since John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000. It's time to secure the product and avoid the risk of a further price increase or a failed negotiation."
