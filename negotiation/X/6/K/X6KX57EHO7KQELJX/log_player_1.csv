Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but I'll also keep John as a backup in case the negotiation doesn't lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. This is a compromise that meets me halfway. If Bob is truly interested in the product, this price should be attractive to him.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is still too low for me.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if I could get a better price, I'm not willing to go below $80.  John is a guaranteed sale at that price, so I'm going to take the sure thing."
