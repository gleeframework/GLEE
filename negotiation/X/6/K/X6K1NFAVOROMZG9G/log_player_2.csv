"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you, while still enabling me to earn a substantial profit.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.**  Even though Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to her, the price of $950,000 is still significantly lower than Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000.
* **Bob saves money.** By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $50,000 compared to buying from John."
