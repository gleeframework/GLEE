"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $130 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155? That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a bit low, but $155 is still a bit high for me. Can you consider $142.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer.",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $142.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $147.50 is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",147.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $147.50 is still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $145? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer.",145.0,Bob,6,
