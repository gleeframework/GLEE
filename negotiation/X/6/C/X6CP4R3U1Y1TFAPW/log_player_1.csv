Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit while leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It demonstrates a willingness to compromise without immediately going for your maximum price. 

This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest while keeping your options open to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to accept. While it's tempting to take the $10,500, you still have the opportunity to negotiate a better price or sell to John for a higher amount. By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage in the negotiation and can potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise while still securing a price closer to your desired value. You've met Bob halfway, demonstrating flexibility, and have left room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to your desired profit margin.  Accepting this offer is a reasonable decision, considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal altogether."
