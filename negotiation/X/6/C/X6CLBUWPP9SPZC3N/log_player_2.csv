"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still above Bob's budget, and there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. There's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get the price lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is the absolute max I can afford.  I'm really hoping we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your situation, and I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still working within your budget.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,500 is getting close to his limit, he can still try to negotiate a bit lower. He's already stated his maximum is $9,000, so there's not much room for him to go higher.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further.  If not, he can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $9,500 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  I think that's a fair compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
