"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to negotiation.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I was quoted by another seller. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a fair price for this product. $90 is still too low for me. How about $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $90, so I'll offer $100. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",100.0,Bob,6,
