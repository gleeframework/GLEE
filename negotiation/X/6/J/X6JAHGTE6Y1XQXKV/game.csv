"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to need a lower price to make this work for me.  How about $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
