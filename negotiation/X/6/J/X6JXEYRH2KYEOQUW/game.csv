"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950000 is unfortunately too low. Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This still leaves us both with a good profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're still working towards a price that fits your budget, but $980000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1020000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial given the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
