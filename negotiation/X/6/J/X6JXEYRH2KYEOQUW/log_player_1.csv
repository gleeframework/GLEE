"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate, and I can potentially get a better price.  Selling to John is a safety net, but I want to try to maximize my profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is unfortunately too low. Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves us both with a good profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below $1,000,000. I want to see if I can push him higher. There's a good chance he'll agree to a price closer to my target value in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still working towards a price that fits your budget, but $980,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial given the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1020000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1020000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 6, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. However, I'm starting to run out of time. If I reject Bob's offer, there are only 4 rounds left, and it's not guaranteed that we'll reach an agreement.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get my minimum and doesn't risk further negotiation."
