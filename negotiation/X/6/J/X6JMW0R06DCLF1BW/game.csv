"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. But $105 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?  This would allow me to make a profit while you get a good deal.",107.5,Alice,5,
