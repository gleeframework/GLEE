Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,350,000,  which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
