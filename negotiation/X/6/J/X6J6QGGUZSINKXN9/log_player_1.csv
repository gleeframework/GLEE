Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** John's offer ensures I won't settle for less than $1,200,000. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message aims to be positive and emphasize the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to maximize profit, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss compared to selling to John. I'll counter-offer in the hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've countered by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($1,100,000) and my initial ask ($1,400,000). 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that the product holds significant value, justifying a higher price than his initial offer.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer is still well above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), ensuring a profit if accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's offer, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will go any higher. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of losing both offers."
