Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150 price:** This is a starting point that allows for some negotiation while still being above your minimum value of $120. 
* **Positive and friendly message:**  It's important to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable to potentially counteroffer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** By saying you're ""open to hearing his thoughts,"" you signal flexibility and encourage him to engage in the process.

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a good starting price:** Hopefully, Bob will accept the offer right away.
* **Start the negotiation process:** If he doesn't, it creates a starting point for counteroffers.
* **Maintain flexibility:** You have the option to accept his counteroffer or make your own, while also having the safety net of selling to John for $120 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is your minimum value, Bob's offer is exactly your minimum.  By rejecting his offer, you create the opportunity to potentially get a higher price. You can counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $120, hoping to meet in the middle at a point closer to your initial offer of $150. 

This strategy allows for:

* **Potential for a better price:** You have the opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to your initial target.
* **Maintaining control:** You don't immediately settle for the minimum, giving you leverage in the negotiation.
* **Using the option of selling to John as a backup:** If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, you can still secure the $120 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a reasonable price:** $135 is a midpoint between your initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $120.
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes finding a compromise.
* **Directly asking for a decision:**  You're prompting Bob to make a decision on your counteroffer,  moving the negotiation forward.

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a better price than Bob's offer:**  You're trying to secure a price closer to your initial target while showing willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain leverage:** You're not accepting Bob's offer immediately, putting some pressure on him to reconsider.
* **Stay within the acceptable range:**  $135 is still above your minimum value, keeping you in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $135. How about $127.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $127.50 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Accepting this offer would result in a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or even a stalemate.

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Close to your minimum:**  $127.50 is only $7.50 above your minimum, which is a small difference. 
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting prevents further negotiation rounds, saving you time and potentially avoiding a scenario where Bob might make a lower counteroffer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's a chance that further negotiations with Bob could lead to a lower price, or even a stalemate where you'd have to sell to John for $120.

While $127.50 isn't your ideal price, accepting it ensures a quick and profitable sale, which is ultimately the most sensible choice in this situation."
