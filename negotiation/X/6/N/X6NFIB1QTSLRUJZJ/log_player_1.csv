"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a justification for the price, appealing to Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Open Ended:**  I leave the door open for a counteroffer by asking for Bob's thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000 but prevents me from potentially getting closer to that amount with Bob. 
* **Strategic Play:** By rejecting, I signal my willingness to continue negotiating, which could encourage Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective,  $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a profitable price.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counter-offer, emphasizing the need for a fair deal for both parties.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiations amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose $920,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Range:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, but we are still $280,000 apart. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** There is still room for improvement. By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and signal my willingness to continue.
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting keeps Bob engaged, potentially increasing his offer. Selling to John now would guarantee $1,200,000 but prevent me from maximizing my potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $935,000. This reflects my desire to reach an agreement, but also ensures I receive a fair price for my product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying within a reasonable range for both of us.
* **Focusing on Agreement:**  I emphasize my desire to reach an agreement, making Bob feel valued and more likely to reciprocate.
* **Fairness:** I justify the price by highlighting my need for a fair deal. 
* **Open Question:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose $915,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price range.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm still $285,000 away from my minimum and there's a possibility of increasing the price further.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and increases the chance of Bob raising his offer.
* **Strategic Play:** Selling to John now would guarantee $1,200,000 but might miss out on a potential higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while ensuring you get a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm still willing to negotiate. However, this is likely my final offer before selling to John.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous one, showing compromise.
* **Highlighting Benefits:**  I emphasize the benefits for both of us, making the deal seem more appealing.
* **Closing the Deal:** I use a direct question to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose $910,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Limited Time:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. There's a high probability that Bob will not raise his offer significantly in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,200,000, which is much higher than Bob's current offer. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** By selling to John, I avoid the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer, potentially leading to a lower price or a deal failing."
