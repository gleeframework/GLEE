"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. It's worth trying to negotiate further and potentially get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet at $9,500?  This would be a good compromise, and would allow us to both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit closer to what you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the next best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm really hoping to stay under $10,000. Would you consider $10,000? That would be a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $10,000, as it's worth more to me. I can offer it to you for $10,750. This is the next best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has already made a counteroffer that was close to his ideal price, and Alice rejected it.  Alice is only willing to come down a small amount, and it seems likely that continued negotiation will only yield small concessions.  With only a few rounds remaining, it's better for Bob to buy from John for his target price of $8,000."
