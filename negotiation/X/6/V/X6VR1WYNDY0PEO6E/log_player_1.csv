"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $100. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm countering with $95. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept this offer."
