"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12500 is still significantly below the value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13500 is the lowest I can go.  This price still provides a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to accept $13250. This final price represents a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a deal worth pursuing.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a better price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13250. I'm willing to go up to $13100, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13100.0,Bob,6,
