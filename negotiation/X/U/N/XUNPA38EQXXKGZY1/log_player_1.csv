Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value of $80, but below your minimum value of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still giving you a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's better to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While $80 is a loss for you, it's not worth selling at that price. You can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, or sell to John for $120 if you're not confident you can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm still willing to work with you to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. How about we meet at $85? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $85 is still below your ideal price, it's closer to your minimum value of $120 than John's offer of $120. Accepting Bob's offer ensures you sell the product and make a profit, though a smaller one. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
