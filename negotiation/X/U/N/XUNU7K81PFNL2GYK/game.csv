"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping we could find a price that's even more agreeable for me. Considering the product's worth to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. Would you be open to considering this counteroffer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1300000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1350000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product, and it allows me to achieve a more favorable outcome.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's worth to me is $1200000, I'm willing to offer $1320000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",1320000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I see we're getting closer.  $1320000 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet at $1340000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal and put this valuable product to work for you.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
