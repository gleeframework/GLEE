"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal for both of us, as the product is worth significantly more to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm going to make one last counteroffer. How about $9750?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",9750.0,Alice,5,
