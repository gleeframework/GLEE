Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as the product is worth significantly more to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although I'm getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for improvement. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm going to make one last counteroffer. How about $9,750?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your last offer, but $9750 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is only slightly above John's offer, I'm going to accept it.  This is a good deal for me, as I'm still able to make a profit. There are only a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
