"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and what you're willing to pay. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $15,500.  It's a fair price, considering I'm willing to go up from my previous offer.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $15,500 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $16,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",16250.0,Alice,5,
