"Hi Alice, I've made several attempts to negotiate a fair price, but I'm starting to feel like we're not on the same page. I'm willing to walk away from this deal and buy the product from John for $12000. I'm giving you one last chance to meet me at a price I'm willing to pay. I'm offering $14000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll be buying from John.",14000.0,Bob,10,
