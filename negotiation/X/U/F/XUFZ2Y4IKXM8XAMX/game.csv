"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?  I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I agree it's a good product, $850,000 is still a little too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $775,000 is still too far below my desired price.  Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while providing you with a significant saving. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
