Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing resistance to going much lower. Her language suggests she may not go much lower than $140.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $120, it's not worth risking further negotiation rounds."
