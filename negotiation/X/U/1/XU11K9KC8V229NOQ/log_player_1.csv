{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 
 
I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant profit for me. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's known value for the product."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and is closer to Bob's last offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away with a profit."

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price. There's no reason to risk further negotiation with Bob or to sell to John for the same price. I'll accept Bob's offer."
