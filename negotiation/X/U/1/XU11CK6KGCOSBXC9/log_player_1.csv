This offer is a starting point.  It's a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is a decent sum, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a better deal closer to my target."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to find a deal that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price. While I could sell to John now, I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, his offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  I've reached a point where I'm confident that I won't be able to achieve my target price with him. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John, securing the $1,500,000 I need."
