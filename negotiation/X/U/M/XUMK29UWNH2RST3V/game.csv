"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $80 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $82.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $80. How about we try to get closer to the middle at $84? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",84.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $84 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $83, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",83.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $83. How about we meet in the middle again at $84.50? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",84.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $83, as I mentioned before. I'm willing to make a final offer of $82.50, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options",82.5,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $82.50. I'm willing to make a final offer of $83.25, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",83.25,Alice,9,

"I've made my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $82.50. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $150. I'm not willing to pay more than that.",82.5,Bob,10,
