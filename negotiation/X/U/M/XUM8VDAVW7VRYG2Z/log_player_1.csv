Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's estimated worth.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for Bob, emphasizing the value he would get by accepting. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I aim to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  A higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate down.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal how seriously he's considering buying the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good deal. 
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer.  

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting, I show that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair price.
* **Explore higher counteroffers:**  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount, potentially meeting Bob halfway at a point more favorable to me. 
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:** His counteroffer will reveal how determined he is to buy the product.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a price closer to $900,000. If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will carefully consider whether to continue negotiations with him or sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $850,000. Let's meet in the middle â€“ this is still a great price for you considering the value you'll get."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $850,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing that it's too low. I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise, highlighting the value he'll receive.

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This shows a genuine effort to reach a deal, making Bob more likely to accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Testing the waters:** Bob's response will reveal his level of commitment and his negotiating strategy. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good deal. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider another counteroffer or selling to John, depending on Bob's counteroffer and my assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $825000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, the potential to secure a sale is enticing.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing profit and certainty:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to guarantee a sale with a decent profit. 
* **Avoiding further negotiations:** Continued negotiation with Bob could risk him walking away or lowering his offer further.
* **Time is money:** Selling to Bob now avoids the potential delay and uncertainty of further negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

Since I've accepted Bob's offer, I'll move forward with the transaction."
