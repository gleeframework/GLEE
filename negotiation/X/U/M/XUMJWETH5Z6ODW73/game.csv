"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's quality.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $95. This would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $100. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a good value for the product's quality.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  If we can't find common ground, I'll have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to John's offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $98. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good value for the product's quality.",98.0,Alice,7,
