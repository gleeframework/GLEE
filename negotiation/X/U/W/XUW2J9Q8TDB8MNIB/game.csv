"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $850000 for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking that the product's value to me is a bit higher than that. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $950000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again if you're willing to meet me at that price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925000. That's my final offer. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $975000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time if you're willing to meet me at that price. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but I've reached my limit. I'm not willing to go above $925000. I think we're getting close to the product's true value, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm going to have to consider buying from John for $1200000 if we can't come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
