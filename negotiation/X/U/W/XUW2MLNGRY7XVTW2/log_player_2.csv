"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150. 
* Alice's offer is $140, which is still higher than your ideal price.
* You have a better alternative: buying from John for $150. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can get the product from John for a price you are comfortable with."
