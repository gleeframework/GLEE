Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This initial offer is strategic. It:

* **Sets a high starting point:** It establishes the value of the product and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Demonstrates confidence:** It shows that I believe in the worth of my product. 
* **Opens the door for a counteroffer:** It allows Bob to express his interest and potentially initiate a negotiation. 

By offering the product at its full value to Bob, I maximize my chances of securing a good deal while also having the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm hoping to get the product for a slightly lower price.  Considering your value for it, I'd be willing to pay $800000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** for now. Here's why:

* **Value for me:**  The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Accepting $800,000 would mean a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation room:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting gives me the opportunity to counter and try to secure a higher price.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to immediately accept Bob's offer. 

I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $800,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** It demonstrates that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Offers a reasonable compromise:** Splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer presents a middle ground.
* **Maintains my desired profit margin:** $900,000 still brings me closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000, while offering a lower price to Bob."
