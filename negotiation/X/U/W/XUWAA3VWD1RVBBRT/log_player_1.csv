Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While you aim for $10,000, starting at your desired price leaves a slight possibility for Bob to negotiate up, potentially earning you even more. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is framed as a beneficial opportunity for Bob, but clearly states your desired price."
