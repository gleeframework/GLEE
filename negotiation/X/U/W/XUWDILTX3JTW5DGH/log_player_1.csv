Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,075,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! However,  $1,112,500 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $1,095,000? This brings us closer to a deal and keeps it within a reasonable range.
