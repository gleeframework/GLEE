Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is a final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice is playing hardball and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $1,100,000 secures a savings compared to John's offer."
