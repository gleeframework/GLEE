"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's a fair compromise and allows us to make a deal. Let's close this now!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. This would be a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
