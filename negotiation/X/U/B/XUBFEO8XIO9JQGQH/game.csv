"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident its value will be even greater to you. My initial offer is $1800000. This reflects the product's exceptional qualities and the potential for significant growth. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $1800000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is the maximum I can afford and still make this a worthwhile investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a valuable asset.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and generate significant returns for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still outside my range.  I'm prepared to pay $900000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increasing offer. While $900000 is closer, it's still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1100000. This price reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and is a fair compromise.  I believe in this product and its potential for you, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and represents a fair compromise. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and your increasing offer, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end and is a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's close this deal, and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with your purchase.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $1000000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
