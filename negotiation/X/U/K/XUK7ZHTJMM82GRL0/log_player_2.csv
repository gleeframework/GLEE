"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's significantly less than what I would get from another buyer, and it's still well below your estimated value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than what she would get from another buyer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a lower price."
