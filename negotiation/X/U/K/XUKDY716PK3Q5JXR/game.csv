"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $825000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
