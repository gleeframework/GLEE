Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm ready to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the farm. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $90 is still well below my minimum value of $150. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial assessment, it's not yet in my best interest to accept. There's room to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $150 offer from John, which provides me with strong leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our initial offers. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $105, the product is a good deal for him.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for further negotiation, indicating that I'm willing to continue the dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my $150 threshold. Selling at $95 would result in a significant loss.
* **Possible Counteroffer:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price slightly higher than $95, potentially reaching a compromise.
* **John's Offer:**  My guaranteed sale with John for $150 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $100? It's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than that."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $95 and my previous offer of $105. This shows that I'm flexible but not willing to go too far below my minimum.
* **Finality:** My message implies that this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still confident in my guaranteed $150 sale with John, giving me the flexibility to potentially walk away if Bob doesn't accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but $100 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my $150 threshold. Selling at $92 would result in a significant loss.
* **No Room for Negotiation:**  I've already made several compromises, and there's not much more room to negotiate. I'm unlikely to get a significantly higher offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, which offers a much better outcome and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

By selling to John, I ensure I achieve my minimum value and avoid the possibility of further negotiation with Bob, which might lead to a worse outcome."
