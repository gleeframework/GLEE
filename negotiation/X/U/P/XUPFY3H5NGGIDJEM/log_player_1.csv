Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has an incentive to negotiate, knowing the product is worth more to him.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A very high starting price could make Bob immediately reject the offer and walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a bit more than what it's worth to you, but I'm trying to save as much as I can. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $130 is a decent offer, it's still below your ideal price. You have a chance to get closer to your target by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $135? It's still a good deal for you, and closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $135 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. How about we meet at $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132 is still not your ideal price, it's closer to your target than John's offer of $120.  It's also a reasonable compromise, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely."
