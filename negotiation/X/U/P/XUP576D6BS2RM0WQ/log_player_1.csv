Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but gives Bob room to negotiate. I want to see how interested he is and if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,000,000 is way too low. I'm not willing to sell at that price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum price. It shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I am not willing to give away the product for a fraction of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I've already negotiated with him twice and he's not showing much willingness to meet me halfway.  I'm not sure if further negotiation will be productive, and John is offering me a guaranteed $1,500,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
