Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys and utilizes it effectively.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,000 (your minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum). Any price within this range could lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Aiming too high risks him rejecting it and you settling for $1,000,000 from John.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. It has the potential to significantly benefit your operations, and I'm confident it's worth considerably more than the asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000, reflecting its true value and offering you a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and the price as a ""deal.""
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 profit, a strong incentive to accept.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, there's some room to negotiate downwards slightly if Bob hesitates, but not below your $1,000,000 minimum.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there might be back-and-forth offers and counter-offers."
