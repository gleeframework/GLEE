"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's worth that much to you, and I know you'll be happy with it. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to the $1,000,000 price by stating its worth to you and mentioning another buyer.  While there's a chance she might negotiate down, you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer from her at a lower price."
