Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this stage. I'm very interested in the product and see its value, but I'd like to offer $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.
