"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this stage. I'm very interested in the product and see its value, but I'd like to offer $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to your target, it's still higher than your budget.  You can likely negotiate further to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both some room to maneuver.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $825,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above your budget. At this point, it's wiser to buy from John and secure the product for a price you're comfortable with.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice down to your target price."
