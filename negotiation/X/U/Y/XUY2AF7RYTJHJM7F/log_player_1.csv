Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is positive and encouraging.** It emphasizes the value the product will bring to Bob and sets a friendly tone for the negotiation.

**Important considerations:**

* This initial offer leaves a gap for Bob to counter. This will allow you to judge his level of interest and adjust your strategy accordingly.
*  It's important to remember that John is a backup option at $1,500,000. If the negotiation with Bob stalls or leads to unacceptable prices, you can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000).  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still gives you a great deal on this valuable product. This price reflects the true value and potential benefits it offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is a compromise.**  I'm reducing my price from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, showing flexibility while still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Highlight the value for Bob.**  The message focuses on the potential benefits and emphasizes the ""great deal"" at this price.
* **Keep the conversation positive and solution-oriented.** The message avoids being aggressive and aims to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to evaluate his next counter-offer and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,500,000, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John. 
* **Guaranteed price:** John's offer represents a significantly higher return than Bob's current offer, and the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer is high.
* **Minimizing potential losses:**  Even though I would get a decent price from Bob, John's offer offers a greater financial gain.

**Conclusion:**

Selling the product to John guarantees the highest profit and minimizes potential losses from further negotiation with Bob."
