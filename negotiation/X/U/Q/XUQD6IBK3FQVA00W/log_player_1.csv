Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that figure makes sense.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I want to be close to Bob's maximum, a slightly lower price might make him more agreeable without much negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John ($8,000), so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
