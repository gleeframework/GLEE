"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $8,500?  I'm genuinely interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference at $8,750?  I'm confident you'll find this product a great value at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $8,000. Bob should try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down closer to his preferred price.  There are still several rounds to go, and a counteroffer might lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,750 is still a bit outside my range. I'm happy to pay $8,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $8,500. This price is fair for both of us and ensures a successful transaction. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still $500 more than Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, Bob has already made several counteroffers and it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 and save $500. This ensures a quick and straightforward transaction while staying within his budget."
