Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still looking to save a significant amount. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.

Explanation:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, it's clear he's trying to lowball you. The increments in his counteroffers are getting smaller, indicating he might not be willing to move much higher.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), it's no longer worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."
