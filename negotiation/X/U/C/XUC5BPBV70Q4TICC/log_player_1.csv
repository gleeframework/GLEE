Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High starting point:**  Starting at $149 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to counter-offer) while staying above your minimum.
* **Polite but firm:** The message is friendly but doesn't reveal your minimum price or desperation to sell.

**Why this is better than offering at $80 or close to Bob's value:**

* You have no leverage in the negotiation and significantly undervalue your product.
* Bob might be willing to pay more than $80, and you'd miss that opportunity."
