"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far too high, and Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice, but it's important to remember that John is a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $18,000 represents the high-end of the product's value, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is better than $18,000, it's still higher than Bob's budget and John is offering the product for $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but Bob shouldn't be afraid to walk away if he feels the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
