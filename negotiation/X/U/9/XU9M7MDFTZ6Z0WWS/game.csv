"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. ",120.0,Alice,5,
