"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming to pay as little as possible, so I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. I've acknowledged Alice's offer while clearly stating my preferred price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $100, I'm anchoring the negotiation closer to Alice's value of the product ($100 to her). This increases the chances of getting a more favorable deal than if I started with a counteroffer closer to $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $110 is a significant saving compared to John's price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price, indicating willingness to make a deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Alice might not go much lower. Accepting now secures a good price without the uncertainty of further back-and-forth."
