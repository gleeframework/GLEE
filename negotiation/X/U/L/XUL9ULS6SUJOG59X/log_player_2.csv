"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's less than what John would charge, it still leaves room for negotiation. You should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing that you're serious about getting a good deal. $1,000,000 is still a fair price for Alice since it's significantly more than her own valuation. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While that offer is appealing, I believe this product's true value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still too high. There's still room for negotiation, especially since Alice is willing to compromise. You should reject the offer and try to get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I value this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by increasing your offer.  $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's price and is a good middle ground. This should push the negotiation closer to a successful conclusion."
