{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to remember that John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, so any price Bob offers below that is less than ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than the initial offer and potentially leaves room for further negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows for the possibility of reaching a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your perspective, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While it's tempting to push for a higher price,  $1,250,000 is still a substantial gain and closer to the initial target than what John offers.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or a lower price, making this offer the most advantageous choice."
