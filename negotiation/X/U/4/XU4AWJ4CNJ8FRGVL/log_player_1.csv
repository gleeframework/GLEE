Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so you should not sell to Bob for less.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) leaves room for negotiation. While $170 might seem high, it gives you space to potentially come down in price and still get a better deal than $150. 
* **Gauging interest:** Bob's response will tell you how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. If he rejects this offer, you can always propose a lower price, moving closer to your minimum."
