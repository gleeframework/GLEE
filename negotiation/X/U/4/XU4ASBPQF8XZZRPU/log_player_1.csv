Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm confident Bob will consider this offer as the product is worth $100 to him.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still ensuring I make a profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $98 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to justify further negotiation.  At this point, John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and a sure win.  I'm going to sell to John."
