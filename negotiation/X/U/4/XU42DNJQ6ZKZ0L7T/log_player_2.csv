"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, and Alice's offer is $1,100,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's a significant gap between your desired price and Alice's offer, making negotiation worthwhile.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to counteroffer Alice with a price that is lower than $1,100,000 but still higher than $800,000 to try and find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** This counteroffer represents a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness about finding a deal. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $900,000 is still above your maximum, but leaves room for negotiation. This should encourage Alice to come down from her initial asking price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to monitor Alice's response and be prepared to make further counteroffers or accept if her counteroffer falls within your acceptable range. Remember, you can always walk away and buy from John if negotiations become unproductive."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $1,000,000 is still significantly above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Negotiations have stalled:**  Alice's refusal of your last counteroffer indicates she may be unwilling to go lower.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to lead to a significant price reduction. 
* **John is a better option:** You can secure the product from John for $800,000, which is within your budget and a better deal than Alice's current offer. 

**Conclusion:**

It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John. While you may have hoped to get a better price from Alice, the negotiations have not yielded the desired results.  It's important to know when to walk away and accept a good deal."
