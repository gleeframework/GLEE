"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's still within Bob's potential value range but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and framing the offer as a ""great deal"".
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! Deal closed.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing. 
* **If Bob rejects or I don't like his counteroffer:** I'll make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing profit but also the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. This gives me an opportunity to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Potential for higher gain:**  If I can negotiate a price closer to my minimum, I can earn more than selling to John.

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 while keeping in mind Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* I'll consider the potential for selling to John as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable price for me.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Focus on agreement:** I'm emphasizing the need to reach an agreement, showing a desire to close the deal.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! Deal closed.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.
* If Bob rejects or I don't like his counteroffer, I'll continue to negotiate, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be feasible for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Further negotiation possible:**  There's still room for negotiation, as Bob is showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push for a higher price that is closer to my minimum.

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum, while still considering his willingness to negotiate.
* I'll keep the option of selling to John in mind if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $11,750.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,500) and Bob's current offer ($11,000). This shows a commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair price that considers both of our needs. This makes the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Continuing to negotiate:**  I'm not giving up yet, as I believe there's still room for a deal that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! Deal closed.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. 
* **If Bob rejects or I don't like his counteroffer:** I'll continue to negotiate, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John as a fallback option.  However, I'm getting closer to my minimum and need to be cautious about losing out on a potentially better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. To be honest, $11,500 would be the absolute most I could do. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Bob has stated that $11,500 is his absolute maximum. This indicates that there may not be much more room for upward negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could accept and secure a sale, the risk of selling for a price that is significantly below my minimum is high. I have a chance of getting a better price if I continue to negotiate.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise.
* **Potential for a deal:** Even though Bob is at his limit, there's still a chance for him to increase his offer slightly.
* **Fallback option:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this deal work. It's a significant compromise for me, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a price that is very close to my minimum, but still allows for some wiggle room for Bob. It shows a strong willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price, even though it's a compromise on my end.
* **Urgency:**  I'm indicating a desire to close the deal, suggesting that further negotiation might not be fruitful.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept:** If Bob accepts, the deal is closed.
* **Reject:** If Bob rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John for $15,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, but I need to balance the potential for a better deal with the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
