"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, you can still do better.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to your ideal price of $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $887500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, the price is still higher than what John is offering. At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation with Alice are small, and the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer is high.  It's more efficient and less risky to buy from John and secure the product at your target price."
