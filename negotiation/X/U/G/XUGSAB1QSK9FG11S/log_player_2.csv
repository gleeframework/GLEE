(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and John is selling the product for $12,000. Alice's offer is the same as John's. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might as well reject it and buy from John."
