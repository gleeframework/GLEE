Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $130. I believe it would be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with a high offer of $130 aims to get you the maximum possible profit. While Bob values the product at $150, there's no guarantee he'll be willing to pay that much.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob counters your initial offer, you have space to negotiate down towards $80 without jeopardizing your minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have John willing to buy the product for $80 gives you leverage in the negotiation. You don't *need* to sell to Bob for less than your minimum."
