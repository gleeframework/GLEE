{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of its worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net of $800,000, Bob is willing to pay significantly more ($1,200,000). Our goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below our guaranteed price from John. This strategy aims for a win-win while maximizing your profit. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value and invites Bob to engage in a discussion, increasing the chances of a successful sale."
