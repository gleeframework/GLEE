"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $11,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $11,250 for the product. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise.",11250.0,Alice,5,
