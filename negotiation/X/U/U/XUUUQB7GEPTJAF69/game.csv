"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I'm on a budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below its true value. How about we settle at $1,450,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
