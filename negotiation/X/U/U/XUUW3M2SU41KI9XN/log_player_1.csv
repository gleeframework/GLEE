``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 115}

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $105? This is a fair price for the value of the product, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 105}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. It's time to stop negotiating and sell the product to John for $150.  While I'd like to have gotten a higher price, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale."
