Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's still below my ideal price, but it's the best I can get in the limited rounds and it's better than selling to John for a lower profit margin."
