"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you time to try and get a better price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can make a counteroffer and try to get the price down closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.**  A $100,000 reduction shows you're serious about negotiating but are willing to pay a fair price. 
* **Be polite but firm.**  The message conveys your interest while stating your price point clearly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay.**  $950,000 is still significantly higher than your target price of $900,000. 
* **You still have plenty of rounds left.** There's no rush to accept an offer that's not yet in your ideal range.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** A small increase to $925,000 shows you're serious about closing the deal but still trying to save money.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  The message highlights the price as being fair for both parties, making it more likely Alice will consider it.
* **Open to agreement:** The message ends by expressing your willingness to reach an agreement, indicating a positive and collaborative approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  $925,000 is closer, but I still need a bit more to make this work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $937,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target price.**  $937,500 is only $12,500 away from your last offer of $925,000.
* **You have 5 rounds left.**  Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly better price, but it also risks losing the deal or running out of time. 
* **The product is worth $1,200,000 to you.**  At $937,500, you're getting a significant discount and a good deal.

While you could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer is a smart move. You're saving a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John, and the risk of losing the deal or not getting a better offer is high."
