"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value and the opportunity it presents. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to value:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product, hoping to entice Bob into considering my offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in further discussion. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to compromise and ensuring that the negotiation remains positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price.  I'm not yet at a point where selling to John for $15,000 is the best option, as there's still room for improvement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $12,000 to $11,500. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and how this price still represents a good deal for both of us. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial outcome. 

This counteroffer aims to close the gap between our desired prices while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend at this time.  I'm willing to offer $11000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my desired range. I'm confident that we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.  Therefore, I will reject the offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 still doesn't fully reflect the value of this product. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This price is a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's finalize this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm demonstrating a commitment to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate that $11,250 is a fair reflection of the product's value, emphasizing the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm pushing for closure with a call to action, suggesting that this price is the final offer for a mutually beneficial deal. 

This strategy aims to close the deal in this round by offering a price that is both fair and incentivizes Bob to accept."
