,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend at this time.  I'm willing to offer $11000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11000 still doesn't fully reflect the value of this product. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $11250. This price is a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's finalize this deal, what do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
