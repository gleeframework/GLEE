"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a fair price.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can offer it to you for $105 again, but this is my last compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make sure to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",105.0,Alice,7,
