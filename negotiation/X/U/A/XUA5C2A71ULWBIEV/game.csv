"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you than it is to me. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 to find a mutually agreeable price.  This still represents a significant profit for you, and allows me to achieve a price closer to my value.  Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1200000. However, I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1250000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
