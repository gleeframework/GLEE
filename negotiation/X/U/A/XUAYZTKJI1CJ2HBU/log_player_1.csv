Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is a starting point. It allows me to make a significant profit while still leaving some room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, this price is attractive to him and leaves potential for us to settle on a price that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still a decent profit, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I know the product is worth more to him. I will counteroffer and try to reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This price is still a good profit for me, but it also leaves room for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now close to the value I would get from selling to John.  Given that I've already spent time negotiating, and the risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower offer, I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
