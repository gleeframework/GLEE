"I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to pay a premium, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I've already been willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. I'm not willing to go any lower than $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. Would you be willing to consider $9200?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm afraid $9200 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'm thinking of $8500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000",8500.0,Bob,6,
