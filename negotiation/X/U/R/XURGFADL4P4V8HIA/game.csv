"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth the full $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which still leaves room for us to both have a good deal. Let's find a middle ground, I'm sure we can work something out.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $85. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $95.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, which is the closest I can get to my target price of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",87.5,Bob,6,
