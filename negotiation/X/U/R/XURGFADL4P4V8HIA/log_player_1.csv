{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $80, so $100 is still a good deal for him. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $120, so this gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It doesn't leave any room for confusion about your offer.

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation process. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth the full $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  You'll need to counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which still leaves room for us to both have a good deal. Let's find a middle ground, I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $85. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price. You're better off trying to negotiate a bit higher, as you have the option to sell to John for $120 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $95.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, which is the closest I can get to my target price of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation has gone on for a while, and Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and sell the product to John for $120.  This guarantees you a profit and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiations."
