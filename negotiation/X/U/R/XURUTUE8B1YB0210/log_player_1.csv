Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. My initial asking price is $15,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to get a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $12500. How about $11250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,250 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price."
