Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. How about $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

Here's why this is a good strategy for Alice:

* **Starts High:**  Alice anchors the negotiation high, closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** The $110 offer gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice if he accepts. 
* **Considers the Alternative:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed $80 with John, so she's not desperate and can afford to aim higher with Bob."
