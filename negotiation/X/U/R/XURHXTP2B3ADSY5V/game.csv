"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm really interested in the product, though. Would you be willing to do $80? ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a little higher than my budget.  I'm firm on $80.  If you're not able to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
