"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We have plenty of room to negotiate down from Alice's opening offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we start at $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer gives us more room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $1,200,000 maximum.  This initial offer tests Alice's willingness to move from her starting price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in price, but we're still a ways off from a favorable deal.  We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value in the product, I need to stay within a certain budget.  Would you consider $725,000?"", ""product_price"": 725000}

**Reasoning:** We're moving up incrementally, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but also holding firm on getting a significant discount. This offer splits the difference between her last offer and our previous counteroffer, encouraging her to meet us closer to the middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has now met us at her original product value of $800,000. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and a reasonable price considering our alternatives. While we might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's unlikely to be worth the risk of prolonged negotiations, especially since we only have five rounds remaining.  Accepting now secures a good deal for us."
