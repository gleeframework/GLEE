"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  While I'm interested, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to buy it for $75.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $82.50 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $78 for it.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",78.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $80.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",80.5,Alice,5,
