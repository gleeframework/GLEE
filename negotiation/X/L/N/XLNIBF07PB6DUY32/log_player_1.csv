Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's not too aggressive:**  $150 is significantly more than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is short and to the point, explaining the offer.
* **It's positive:** The message highlights the value of the product and uses positive language.

Remember, the goal is to get Bob to accept your offer while still maximizing your profit. Keep track of how Bob reacts and adjust your offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is your minimum, it's worth trying to get a better price.  You can make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about $125? That's still a fair price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a good compromise. It's a lower price than your initial offer, but still higher than your minimum. You're also acknowledging Bob's interest and trying to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is closer to your minimum of $100, and it's better than selling to John for $100. You're still making a profit, and it seems like Bob is genuinely interested in the product.  It's a good deal to close."
