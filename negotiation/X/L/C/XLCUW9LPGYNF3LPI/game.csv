"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go that high. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,400,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for a bit of wiggle room.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I can't go as low as $1,400,000, but I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer takes into account the product's true value and leaves less room for further negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $1,600,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $1,500,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and would allow me to finalize the purchase.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
