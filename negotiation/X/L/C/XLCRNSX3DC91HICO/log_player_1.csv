Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already making a profit of $150,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** You're not starting too low and risking a counteroffer that's too close to your minimum. 

This strategy allows you to potentially secure a higher price while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested in a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer, and you have room for further negotiation.  

**Next Steps:**

You will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer but lower than your initial offer. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and increases your chances of getting a better price than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, while also giving you a great deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer strikes a balance between your desire to earn more and the need to keep Bob engaged. It's a compromise that acknowledges his initial offer while keeping the price above your minimum.  

**Why this approach is effective:**

* **Shows flexibility:**  You demonstrate that you're willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintains leverage:** The price is still higher than Bob's offer, giving you the upper hand.
* **Remains within your target range:**  $900,000 is within your acceptable range and leaves room for a potential final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still not quite enough to make it worthwhile for you to accept. You have the opportunity to get a better price by continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

You will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer but lower than your previous offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and increases your chances of getting a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $875,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to close the gap between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It's a small move, but it shows flexibility while still remaining profitable for you.

**Why this approach is effective:**

* **Compromise:** It demonstrates your willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Closing the gap:** It significantly reduces the price difference, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Profitable:** The price is still higher than your minimum, ensuring a profitable transaction.

By showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price, you increase the chances of Bob accepting your offer and completing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than your ideal price, it's very close to your minimum and represents a significant profit. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for a significantly lower price. 

**It's a calculated risk:**

* **Potential loss:** You're leaving $10,000 on the table compared to your previous counteroffer.
* **Guaranteed profit:** You're securing a profitable deal that is above your minimum.
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation could be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly better offer.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision, balancing the potential for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
