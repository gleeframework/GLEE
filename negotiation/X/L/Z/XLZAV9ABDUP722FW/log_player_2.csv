{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,020,000. This is closer to Alice's latest offer and might be enough to convince her to accept. I'm still hoping to secure a lower price than John's but acknowledge that this might be the best deal I can get."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, and I've already made multiple counteroffers.  It's unlikely that she'll come down further, and continuing the negotiation will only cost me more time. At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John and secure the product for my maximum budget."
