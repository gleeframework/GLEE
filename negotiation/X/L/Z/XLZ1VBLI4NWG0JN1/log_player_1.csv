"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. I think it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Message:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a higher price from Bob.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** While $100 from John is a guaranteed profit, I want to maximize my profit and see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $110 to $105. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm asking Bob for a direct answer to gauge his interest in finalizing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit shy of that. Would you be willing to meet me at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $92.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still a chance Bob might be willing to pay closer to my desired price, especially since he's shown interest and made a counteroffer.
* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob before selling to John for a guaranteed but lower profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $92.50 just doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop the price to $100, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($92.50). This shows a genuine attempt to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Final Offer Tone:** My message implies this is a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  At this price, I'm securing my minimum acceptable price, and I'm still avoiding selling to John at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already at Round 6, and with only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a deal with Bob increases.
* **Limited Upside:** Bob's latest offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. The potential for getting a higher price from Bob seems limited.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John at $100 guarantees me a decent profit and minimizes the risk of losing out completely.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm choosing to secure a guaranteed sale with John to avoid further negotiation and potential losses."
