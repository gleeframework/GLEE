"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price point of $1,000,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Since Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, there's a potential for a deal that benefits both of you. 
* **Rejection allows for counteroffers.**  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $850,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  A $50,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable compromise.
* **Expressing interest:**  The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product while clearly stating his financial limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise, meeting you halfway from your previous offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation, but not worth the risk:** While you could continue to negotiate, there's a chance Alice might become stubborn and the deal might fall through.
* **Close to your maximum:**  $875,000 is significantly lower than buying from John, making this a more financially advantageous option."
