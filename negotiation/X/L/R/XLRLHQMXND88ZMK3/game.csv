"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price reflects a fair deal for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at $900,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,000,000. It's a small increase, but it's worth considering the value this product brings to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm prepared to finalize the purchase at $950,000. This price offers a reasonable profit for you and allows me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,050,000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 5-year warranty. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
