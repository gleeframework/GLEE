{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $110, which is still above Bob's maximum price.
* **Buying from John:**  $120 is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay, but it's a backup option. 
* **Rejecting and Counteroffering:**  This allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price, potentially saving money. 

By rejecting, Bob starts the negotiation process and has a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible, while still securing the product.
* **Previous Offer:** Alice offered $110, which was too high.
* **Counteroffer:** Offering $100 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but still within Bob's acceptable range. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Previous Offer:** Alice offered $115, which is still above Bob's ideal price, but closer to his maximum.
* **Counteroffer:** Offering $105 is a moderate compromise. It's higher than Bob's previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate, but still significantly lower than Alice's offer.
* **Negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows Bob to test Alice's willingness to compromise further. It's a reasonable middle ground that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $112.5, which is still above Bob's ideal price, but very close to his maximum.
* **Buying from John:**  $120 is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** At this point, there is a risk that further negotiation will lead to Alice becoming more rigid and potentially refusing to sell.

Alice's offer is very close to Bob's maximum, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price. It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer is likely the best option to secure the product at a price that is relatively close to Bob's desired price."
