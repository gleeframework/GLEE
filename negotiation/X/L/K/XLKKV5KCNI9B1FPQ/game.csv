"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was looking for. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $625,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $700,000 is the lowest I can go. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down on the price. To make this work for both of us, how about we settle at $660,000? This represents a significant savings for me while still being a good deal for you.",660000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $680,000 is my final offer. This is already a great deal for you, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,7,
