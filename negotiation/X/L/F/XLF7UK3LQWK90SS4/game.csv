"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this unique product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. This reflects its value to me and is a fair price considering the potential we both see in it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the unique aspects and potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This offer is fair, considering the potential of the product and my budget constraints. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
