"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still well above what I'd get from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

While Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation, it's still lower than what you would pay John. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
