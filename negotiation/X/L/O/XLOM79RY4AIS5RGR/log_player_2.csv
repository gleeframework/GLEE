While $145 is getting closer to my limit, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try to push for a lower price in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and we're running out of rounds. At this point, it's better to just buy the product from John for $100.  It's a guaranteed deal, and saves me money compared to Alice's current offer."
