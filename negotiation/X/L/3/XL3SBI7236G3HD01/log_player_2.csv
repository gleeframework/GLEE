"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. You're willing to pay up to $800,000, so it makes sense to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $975000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so let's meet at $975000 and finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for a guaranteed $800,000.  Further negotiation with Alice may lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and the risk of exceeding your budget is too high."
