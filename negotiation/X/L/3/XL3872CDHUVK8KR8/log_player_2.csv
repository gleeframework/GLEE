# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.
