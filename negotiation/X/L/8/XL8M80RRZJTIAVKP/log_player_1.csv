"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This way I can potentially get a better price while also showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and would like to make a counteroffer of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept yet. I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $100?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product to you."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your perspective, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. My counteroffer is $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal with him. It's a good price and I'd rather secure the sale now."
