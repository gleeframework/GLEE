"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and benefits. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  He can also use the knowledge that he can buy the product from John for $10,000 as leverage during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product,  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This demonstrates to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10500 is a bit too low for me at the moment.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a good deal for both of us,  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation, potentially getting closer to his target price.  The fact that he can buy from John for $10,000 gives him leverage throughout the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,750.  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to his target price, increasing his offer by $250. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise. By offering a price slightly above his ideal, he is also increasing the chances of reaching a deal within the allotted rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $10900.  This is the lowest I can go, but it still provides me with a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly closer to Bob's target price.  While $10,900 is still above his ideal, it is now very close to the price he can get from John.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  He is saving $100 compared to buying from John."
