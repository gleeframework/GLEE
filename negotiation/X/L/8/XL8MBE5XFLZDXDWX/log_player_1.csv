Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit with John as Backup:**  We have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000. This means we shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a potential win-win: 
    * Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its worth to him.
    * Alice makes $150,000 more than selling directly to John.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
