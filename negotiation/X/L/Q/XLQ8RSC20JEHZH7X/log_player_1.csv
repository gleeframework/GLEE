"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $2,000,000. I believe it holds great potential for your business. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is still significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000). There's room to negotiate further and aim for a better price. 
* **Strategic Play:**  Rejecting the offer signals that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I value the product highly. This could potentially make Bob more willing to increase his offer.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob will come closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a counteroffer to Bob that's still above my minimum but closer to his offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" considering the value of the product, to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open Ended Question:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to engage further and potentially lead to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to sell it for any less.
* **Time Constraint:** I have only 6 rounds left, and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer. 
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to buy the product for my minimum price, offering a secure and guaranteed sale.
* **Risk vs Reward:**  While I might get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement and potentially losing the sale entirely outweighs the potential reward.

Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing out completely."
