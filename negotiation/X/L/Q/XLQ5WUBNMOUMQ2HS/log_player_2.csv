# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you value at $120, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
