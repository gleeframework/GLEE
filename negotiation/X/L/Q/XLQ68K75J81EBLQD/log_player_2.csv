"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same price as John's offer. Since there's no advantage to buying from Alice, and you know you can get the product from John for your maximum budget, it's best to go with the guaranteed option."
