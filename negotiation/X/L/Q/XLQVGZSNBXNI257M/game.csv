"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's still a good deal for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a bit more than I initially offered, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
