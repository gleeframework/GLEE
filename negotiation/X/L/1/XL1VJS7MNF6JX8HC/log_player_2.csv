# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.
