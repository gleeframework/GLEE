"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $12,000 is less than $15,000.
* **You still save money:** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, so even at $12,000 you're getting a good deal."
