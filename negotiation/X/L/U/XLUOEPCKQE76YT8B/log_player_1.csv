Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but you also want to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $15,000 if Bob refuses, so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price."
