Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $120. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $120, and your goal is to get the product for the best possible price. You can get it for $100 from John, so it's best to take that offer."
