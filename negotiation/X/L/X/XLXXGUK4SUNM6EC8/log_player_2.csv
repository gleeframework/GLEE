"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John, so anything less than that is a good deal.  Since Alice's offer is $90, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, offering $85 is a good starting point.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still ensuring you get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $87, which is a good price for you. You can get the product for $100 from John, so this is a better deal. There is a chance that you might be able to negotiate a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and then raising her price again isn't worth it."
