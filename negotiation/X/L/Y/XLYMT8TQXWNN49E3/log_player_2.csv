(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Gap:** There's a significant gap between Alice's value ($150) and my maximum ($100), so there's room for compromise.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's $100 offer in mind as a safety net. If Alice won't budge below $100, I'll go with John."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Alice's offer of $80 is close to John's offer of $100.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still push for a better price.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I have 7 rounds left to negotiate, so there's time to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $10, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still keeping my goal of saving money.
* **Middle Ground:** This price is in the middle of my previous offer ($60) and Alice's offer ($80), making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, giving me time to refine the price if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer Still Better:**  Alice's offer of $85 is still above my maximum value from John ($100).
* **Room for Negotiation:** We are getting closer to a deal, but I still have time to push for a lower price.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to make strategic decisions to ensure I get the best possible price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm increasing my offer to $75, which is halfway between my previous offer of $70 and Alice's offer of $85. 
* **Compromise:**  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to save money.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to strike a balance between pushing for a better price and avoiding a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Crossing My Limit:** Alice's offer of $90 exceeds my maximum value ($100).
* **Limited Rounds:**  I have only 3 rounds remaining, and it's unlikely I'll be able to convince Alice to lower her price significantly.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers a guaranteed deal at $100, which is within my budget.  It's the safest option to ensure I get the product."
