"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,025,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I can offer you a compromise at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
