Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible while still ensuring a sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **High but Justifiable:** The price is high, but the message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob, attempting to justify the cost.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a time limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you know about Bob's negotiating style, you might offer a lower price to ensure the sale or a higher price to see if you can get closer to his maximum valuation."
