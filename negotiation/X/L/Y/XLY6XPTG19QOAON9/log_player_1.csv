Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I've priced the product a bit higher than my minimum, but below what I know Bob values it at.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It also allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to give in right away. I'll try to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price closer to the middle ground. Would you consider $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just a bit more than what I could get from John. While I'd prefer my original asking price, I'm willing to accept this and close the deal."
