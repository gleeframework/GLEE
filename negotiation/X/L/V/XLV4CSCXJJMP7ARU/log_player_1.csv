Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion. This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a positive light while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.  Rejecting this offer allows me to explore better terms."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $825,000 is still significantly below my desired value. While I'm open to negotiation, it seems we're reaching a stalemate.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price than John's offer is too high. Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to secure the best possible outcome."
