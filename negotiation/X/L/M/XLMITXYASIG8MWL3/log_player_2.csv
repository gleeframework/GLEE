"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I'm thinking of a price of $150. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth from John.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's within your budget and leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that you're serious about buying but need a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $80 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's the minimum I'm willing to sell for, and it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down, but her offer is still above your maximum budget. There's room to negotiate further towards your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Okay Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about $95? That's a fair compromise between our two prices."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to meet closer to the middle ground while still staying under your budget.  You're demonstrating willingness to negotiate while holding firm to your financial limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $95 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. How about we meet at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you're running the risk of the negotiation dragging on. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $100, which meets your budget. It's time to cut your losses and secure the deal with John."
