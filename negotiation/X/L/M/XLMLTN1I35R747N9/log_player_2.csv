"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price tailored for valued individuals like yourself. Given its immense worth to you, I propose we discuss a price that reflects both the value it holds for you and the investment it represents. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement that respects the $12,000 value it has for you while ensuring a fair return for us. Please let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is full of sales tactics, emphasizing the product's ""immense worth"" and suggesting a price of $12,000 is fair. However, you know your upper limit is $12,000 and John will sell it to you at that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a counter-offer closer to her $8,000 valuation."
