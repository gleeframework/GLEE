Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This leaves room for negotiation, but still reflects the value of the product to me. I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise, still allowing for some profit while acknowledging that Bob is a serious buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get more for the product, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and his counteroffers are not moving significantly. I'm going to accept the offer from John, as it's the closest to my desired price and guarantees a sale without further negotiation."
