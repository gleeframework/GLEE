{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly less than Bob's perceived value but still significantly higher than your minimum desired price. This leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially earn closer to Bob's valuation while still securing a good price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. I believe I can secure a better deal through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which still reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I'm getting closer to a price I'd be comfortable with. How about $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $11,750 is getting closer to my desired price range and is significantly better than selling to John. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
