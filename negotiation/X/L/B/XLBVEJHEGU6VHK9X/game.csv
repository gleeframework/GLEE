"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still providing you a significant return on your investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
