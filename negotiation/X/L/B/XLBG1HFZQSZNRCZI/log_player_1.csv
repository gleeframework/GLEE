{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to potentially earn a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, I believe I can push for a higher price. Bob clearly recognizes the value of the product and is willing to pay more than my minimum. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,100,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think this is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,050,000 is still a very good deal. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and I'm confident that I can't push for a significantly higher price.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
