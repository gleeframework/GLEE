"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's try $9,500. This represents a significant reduction from your initial offer and is closer to what I can afford.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500, which would be $10,750. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is a fair price considering our ongoing negotiation.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $11,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750,  which is a fair price given the ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9,750 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,750, which would be $10,375. Let's see if we can meet at this price. I'm getting close to my minimum, and I'm willing to make one more concession.",10375.0,Alice,9,
