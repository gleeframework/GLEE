"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,750 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is not budging significantly on price. It seems unlikely she'll go below $10,000. At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $8,000 is the most financially sound choice."
