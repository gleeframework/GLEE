"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a reasonable compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",10800.0,Alice,5,
