"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we discuss this further?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
