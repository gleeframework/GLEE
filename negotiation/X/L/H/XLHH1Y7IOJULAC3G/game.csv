"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in the product and think $1400000 would be a fair price. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum. If that works for you, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
