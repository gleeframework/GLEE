{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure $900,000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $750,000 is tempting, I know the product is worth more to Bob and I still have time to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be compensated for the value this product brings. How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push him a little further.  I'm going to reject his offer and try for a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $775,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my original asking price.  Let's try $800,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 800000}
