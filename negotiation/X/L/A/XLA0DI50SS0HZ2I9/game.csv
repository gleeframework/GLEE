"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is still above my ideal price point, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  This offer acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
