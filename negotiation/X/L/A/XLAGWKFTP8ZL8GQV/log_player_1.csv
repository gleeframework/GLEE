Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:**  The price is higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high as to immediately deter him. 
* **Lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential to reach a price that is acceptable to both parties.
* **Positive messaging:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

This approach allows for a back-and-forth negotiation while still maintaining your goal of getting as close to your minimum value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000 to $900000 for this product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial stated range, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You should counter with a price closer to your desired value. Aim for something between $900,000 and $1,000,000 to see if you can find a middle ground. 
* **Highlight your value:**  Emphasize the unique benefits of the product that justify a higher price. 
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob become too difficult."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit lower than what I can reasonably accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose we settle on $950,000 for the product. This price reflects the value you'll gain and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget and the value I seek in the product, I would like to propose a price of $925000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping within my financial limits. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to your desired price point.  While it's still below your minimum of $1,200,000, accepting it provides a significant profit and allows you to avoid the risk of further negotiations.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  $925,000 is a substantial profit for you, considering Bob's initial offer of $850,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing negotiations might lead to a stalemate or a lower price. Accepting this offer saves time and effort.
* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee that you can get a higher price in the next round. It's possible Bob might decline further offers or walk away.

**Recommendation:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and financially sound decision in this scenario. While it's not your ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the circumstances and your goal of maximizing profit."
