Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $99 is just below my minimum and slightly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and makes the offer more appealing.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there might be room to negotiate slightly downward, but I'd still be above my minimum selling price."
