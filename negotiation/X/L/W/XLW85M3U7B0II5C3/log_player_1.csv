Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm initially offering it at $1,000,000.  I think its intrinsic worth is easily justified at this price point, and I'm confident you'll agree once you see all it can do."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at your product's full value to you ($1,000,000), you anchor the negotiation high. This leaves room for negotiation while emphasizing the product's significance. 
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value helps influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility by using the phrase ""initially offering."" This signals to Bob that there might be room for negotiation. 

It's important to remember: You have a strong alternative with John ($1,000,000), so you're not pressured to accept any offer below that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your valuation ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). Accepting this offer would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. It's a unique item with immense potential value, and I'm confident it can deliver substantial returns for you. Would you be willing to consider $850,000?"", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:**  We acknowledge Bob's offer to maintain a positive negotiation environment but firmly state it's too low.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value proposition without directly revealing our bottom line. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  We come down from our initial offer but not drastically.  The counteroffer of $850,000:
    * Is still significantly above Bob's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
    * Is closer to Bob's perceived value ($800,000), increasing the chances of him engaging.
    * Leaves a comfortable margin for you above John's offer. 
 
We want to find a balance between demonstrating flexibility and maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's potential value, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to your position, $750,000 is still a substantial difference from your $1,000,000 walk-away point (John's offer).  You've only had three rounds of negotiation, and there's room for Bob to increase his offer further, especially since he claims to be willing to meet ""halfway.""  

You hold a strong position with John as a guaranteed buyer, so you can afford to be a bit more assertive in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who is offering very close to my asking price.  However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that could be you. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, but that's my absolute best price."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduce Competition:** By mentioning another buyer (""John"" implicitly), we create a sense of urgency and scarcity. This might encourage Bob to be more decisive.
* **Final Offer:** We present $800,000 as our ""best and final"" offer. This signals our seriousness and limits further back-and-forth. 
* **Target Bob's Valuation:** Crucially, we've come down to Bob's stated value for the product ($800,000). This makes it very difficult for him to justify a lower counteroffer without revealing that he's trying to underpay significantly.

This strategy aims to either close the deal at Bob's maximum or prompt him to walk away, allowing you to proceed with John."
