{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130:** This is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Message:** This message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation, emphasizing potential value.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Start strong:**  A higher initial price sets the bar high, giving me more room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Be reasonable:**  $130 is still a good deal for Bob considering he values the product at $80.
* **Encourage engagement:** The friendly message encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

I'm prepared to counter if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm also ready to sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob becomes unproductive."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While it's closer to my initial offer, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and maintain my negotiating position. 
* **Seeking a better deal:** I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price point through a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll now counter Bob's offer, aiming to land somewhere closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we settle on $140?  This is still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$140:**  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** This message is encouraging and focuses on the benefits for both parties.

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a deal:** I'm demonstrating flexibility while still protecting my financial goals.
* **Highlighting the value:** The message emphasizes the good deal Bob is getting at $140, making it more appealing to him.
* **Maintaining a firm position:** I'm not willing to go lower than $140 at this point.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While he's shown some willingness to negotiate, he's not getting close enough to my desired price point.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming and may not result in a satisfactory outcome.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum desired profit, providing certainty and a quick resolution.

**Next Steps:**

I've chosen to take the guaranteed sale to John.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price,  the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is not worth it."
