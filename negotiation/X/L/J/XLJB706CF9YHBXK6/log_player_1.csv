"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffer.  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value while leaving room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I'm also aware that John is offering me $1,500,000, so I have a solid backup option if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm trying to signal my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal. While I could potentially continue negotiating with Bob and see if he would be willing to pay more, there's no guarantee that will happen. I'm happy with this price, and it's important to remember that I have a backup option with John who is also willing to pay this amount."
