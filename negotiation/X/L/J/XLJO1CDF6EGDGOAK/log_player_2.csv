"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice that you are interested, but also that you are serious about your budget. It's a significant discount from her initial offer, but still leaves room for some potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $17,000 is still above my budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $14,000?  This is the highest I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget. It's a reasonable compromise that is closer to Alice's desired price without exceeding my limit."
