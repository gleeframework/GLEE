"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. Let me know if that works for you!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,250. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if that works for you!",13250.0,Alice,5,
