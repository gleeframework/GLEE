"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you an exclusive product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Is that something you'd consider?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $10,000, so I'll offer it to you for $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close!  I can do $8,000, and I think that's a very fair offer. It saves you the hassle of finding another buyer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'll offer it to you for $9,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",9000.0,Alice,7,
