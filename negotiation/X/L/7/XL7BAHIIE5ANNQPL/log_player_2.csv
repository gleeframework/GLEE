"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you an exclusive product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $10,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $10,000, so I'll offer it to you for $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but I'm so close to John's price that it's worth pushing a little further. I'll try one more counter-offer before considering John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close!  I can do $8,000, and I think that's a very fair offer. It saves you the hassle of finding another buyer."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'll offer it to you for $9,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems Alice won't budge below $9,000. It's not worth haggling further when I can get the product for $8,000 from John."
