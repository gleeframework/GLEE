"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you great value.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $780,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to come closer, but $780,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $820,000, and I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product for you. If you're truly serious about getting this, let's find a way to bridge this small gap.",820000.0,Alice,5,
