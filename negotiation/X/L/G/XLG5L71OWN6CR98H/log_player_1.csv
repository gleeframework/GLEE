"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows room for negotiation and potential compromise, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob, making the offer more attractive."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does indicate he's interested. There's potential for a middle ground.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and counter with a more favorable price in the next round. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is still a great price for the product, and it leaves some room for us to agree. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial $17,000, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $15,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  The message remains positive and encourages further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, making it a losing proposition for me.
* **Opportunity to improve:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and increase his offer. There's still potential for a better deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides me with the confidence to keep negotiating with Bob."

```

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the limit:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's final offer of $13,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  While Bob is showing interest and has been increasing his offers, there is not much room for further negotiation.  
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoid a potentially disappointing deal with Bob.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's final offer, there's a significant risk that he will walk away, and I may be unable to get a better offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Selling to John now eliminates the need for further negotiation and potential frustration."
