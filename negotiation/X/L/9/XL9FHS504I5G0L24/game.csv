"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go as high as $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high for me. How about we meet halfway between our offers? Would $13,500 work for you?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget.",12750.0,Bob,4,
