,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product's unique capabilities and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique capabilities, but I still think $1,400,000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market price I could get it for elsewhere.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
