Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price to allow room for negotiation. This creates the impression the product is highly valuable. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, we ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher number, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffer to be closer to our desired range.
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it gives us space to come down while still staying above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

We'll carefully evaluate Bob's counteroffers and decide whether to negotiate further, accept a counteroffer, or take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum of $1,200,000. We have room to negotiate further. We'll aim to bring him closer to our range with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product's unique capabilities and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** We've made a substantial reduction from our initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage further.
* **Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer keeps us well above our $1,200,000 minimum, ensuring we don't settle for less than John's guaranteed offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to our price range. His response will guide our next steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique capabilities, but I still think $1,400,000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market price I could get it for elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Strong Position:** While we could potentially negotiate for a bit more, Bob has shown a willingness to move significantly from his initial offer, and we're already in a strong position.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Further negotiation risks Bob backing out or becoming frustrated. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit. 

It's always good to leave a negotiation feeling like both parties got a fair deal. This outcome achieves that while meeting our financial goals."
