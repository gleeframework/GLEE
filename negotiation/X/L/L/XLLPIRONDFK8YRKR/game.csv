"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $100 to you. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That still leaves you a good amount of value, and gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $87.50? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $89?  That's a fair compromise, and I think we can finally close this deal.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $89. How about we meet in the middle at $88? I think that's a fair price for both of us",88.0,Bob,6,
