"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm working with a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me. How about $14,750?  That's a strong offer.",14750.0,Bob,6,
