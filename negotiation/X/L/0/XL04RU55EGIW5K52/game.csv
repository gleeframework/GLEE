"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it. However, I can't afford $14,000 for this product. Could you possibly lower the price? I am willing to pay up to $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. While $12,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $13,000?  It's a great compromise, and still a significant value for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
