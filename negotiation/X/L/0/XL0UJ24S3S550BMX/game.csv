"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $500,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but $700,000 is still a significant discount from its true value to you. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,5,
