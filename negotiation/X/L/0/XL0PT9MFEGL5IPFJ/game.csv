"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, I'm confident this product offers significantly more value than that.  Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still quite a gap from what I consider a fair valuation.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you. My final offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your transparency about the other buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'd like to know if you're willing to accept it.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
