"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my assessment of the product's potential and uniqueness in the market leads me to place its value significantly higher.  I'd be willing to part with it for $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting its true worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and for your revised proposal. I understand that you believe the product is worth a significant amount, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth the $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our perspectives.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
