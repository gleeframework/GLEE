"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects its true value. I know you're interested, and I believe this is a great opportunity for you. Let me know if you'd like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at the maximum you're willing to pay.**  There's no benefit to accepting her offer, as you can get the same product from John for the same price. 
* **Rejecting the offer doesn't mean you lose the product.** You have a guaranteed alternative with John. 

The goal is to save money, and since both options cost the same, rejecting Alice's offer is the logical choice."
