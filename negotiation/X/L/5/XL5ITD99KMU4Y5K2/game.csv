"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
