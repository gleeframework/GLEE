"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, as it's my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his budget.  He is offering a price that is still a good deal for Alice (higher than her minimum value of $15,000) while being within his acceptable range. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground here! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While it's closer, Bob is unlikely to get it any lower through further negotiation. It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $12,000, guaranteeing the best possible price within his budget."
