"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $160, which is a good compromise. Would you be willing to meet me at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $160.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's the absolute highest I can go.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can make this work.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $100 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $130? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's the lowest I can go without losing money.",130.0,Alice,7,
