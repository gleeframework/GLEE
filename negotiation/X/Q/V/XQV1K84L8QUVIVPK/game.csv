"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",10200.0,Bob,4,
