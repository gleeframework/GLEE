The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is asking $160. This is too high, so I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice $130 for the product. This is still above my maximum price of $120, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $145 is closer to my maximum price, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further."

I'll offer Alice $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. Hopefully, she'll find it acceptable."
