Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $160, knowing it's above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $145. This is still above Bob's value but closer to my minimum value, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also won't sell for less than $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $150. Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum value, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a compromise. John's offer guarantees me my minimum value, so it's the best option for me right now."
