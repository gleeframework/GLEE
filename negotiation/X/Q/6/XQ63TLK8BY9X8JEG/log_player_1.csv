Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
