"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160.  That's closer, but I'm still stuck at $145.  This is my final offer, let me know if you'll take it.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $145 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $155. It's a good deal, and I think you'll really like the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
