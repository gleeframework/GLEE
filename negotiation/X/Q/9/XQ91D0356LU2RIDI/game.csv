"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1050000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to achieve a more reasonable price. Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
