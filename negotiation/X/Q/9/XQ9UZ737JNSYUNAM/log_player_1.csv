"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Optimistic Tone:**  My message is positive and optimistic, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise throughout the next 9 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  While I want to make a deal, selling for $12,000 would be a significant loss.
* **More negotiation is possible.**  There are still 9 rounds left, and Bob has shown interest, meaning we can likely reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  I can use the next round to counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain value:** $16,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out significantly.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I maintain a positive tone, highlighting the value of the product and suggesting a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).  
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  Although it's tempting to take the offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point. There's a chance I can get Bob to agree to $15,000 in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a good deal, there's still potential for a slightly better outcome with Bob.  I'm willing to take that risk."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $14,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best deal we can make."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is my final counteroffer, signaling that I'm serious about closing the deal with Bob. 
* **Small compromise:** I'm only increasing my offer by $500, demonstrating that I'm very close to my minimum.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by emphasizing that this price is a good deal for both of us.
* **Positive but firm tone:** The message is positive but firm, conveying that I'm ready to close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  While I want to make a deal with Bob, accepting $13,500 would be a significant loss.
* **Limited time and negotiation space:** We only have 4 rounds left. Further negotiation might not lead to a better outcome, and time is running out.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a good deal and ensures I don't lose out on a significant profit.  The potential for a slightly better outcome with Bob is not worth the risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
