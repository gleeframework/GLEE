"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $14,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best deal we can make.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
