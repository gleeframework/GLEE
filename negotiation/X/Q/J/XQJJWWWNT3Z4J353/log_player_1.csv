Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a better price, while still leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob a chance to come up a bit, but also sets a firm lower limit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better price, but also keep in mind that selling to John for $12,000 is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation isn't going anywhere. To avoid risking a further drop in price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's not the ideal outcome, but it guarantees me a decent profit and avoids further negotiation."
