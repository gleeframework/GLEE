"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is significantly lower than my asking price, I'm willing to negotiate further. I can offer you the product for $1100000. This price still reflects the value I place on it, but it also acknowledges your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as I'm ready to purchase right now.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still quite a bit lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1000000.  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget limitations. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
