Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is significantly lower than my asking price, I'm willing to negotiate further. I can offer you the product for $1100000. This price still reflects the value I place on it, but it also acknowledges your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

While $1,100,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as you might be able to get a better price."
