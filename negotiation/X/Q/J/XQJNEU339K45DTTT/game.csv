"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $1500000?  This is my maximum budget, but I believe it's still a fair price given the value you mentioned.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1500000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1500000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1650000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value I mentioned earlier. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1650000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1550000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
