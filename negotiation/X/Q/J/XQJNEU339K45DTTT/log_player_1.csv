Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $1500000?  This is my maximum budget, but I believe it's still a fair price given the value you mentioned.
