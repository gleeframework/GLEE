"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$5,000 is a good price**, but there's still room to negotiate and potentially save more. 
* **You don't know Alice's minimum selling price.** It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price.
* **You have 9 rounds left.**  This gives you flexibility to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive first counteroffer:**  Starting with a lower price shows your intent to negotiate seriously and creates room for a compromise. 
* **$4,000 is a significant drop from $5,000.**  This sets a clear expectation that you are looking for a substantial discount.
* **You have 8 rounds left:**  You have time to adjust your strategy based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your desired price.**  $4,500 is significantly lower than her initial offer and represents a good compromise.
* **You have 7 rounds left.**  You can potentially get a lower price with further negotiation, but the risk is that Alice will walk away. 
* **$4,500 is a good deal for you.** You are saving $3,500 compared to buying from John. 

This decision balances the potential for further savings with the risk of losing a good deal and running out of rounds."
