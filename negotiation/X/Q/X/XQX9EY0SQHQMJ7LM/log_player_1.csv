"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, knowing it's above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to build rapport. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm hoping to get Bob to counteroffer, as that's the best way to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9500 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations with Bob. 
* **John is a backup:**  While John is a secure option, I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $9,200? I think that's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a higher price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented:** I'm framing the message as a compromise and expressing confidence in finding a final solution. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough to Bob, but I'm ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $8900, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $8,900 is still below my minimum of $10,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to accept a deal that undervalues my product.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I think there's still room to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price. 
* **John is still the backup:**  It's good to have John as a backup option, but I don't want to give up on Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair as well.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,050? This is a small compromise for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9050}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying closer to my desired price. It shows that I'm actively trying to find a solution.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the benefits of the compromise, emphasizing the potential for a quick and mutually beneficial agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9050. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which would be $8950. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $8,950 is still below my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Better Outcome:** I believe we can still reach a more favorable price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **John Remains a Safety Net:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm determined to see if I can push for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $8,950 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference again - how about $9,000? This is a small step for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference Again:** This strategy shows flexibility and a desire to find common ground. It also maintains a focus on moving the price upward.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the benefits of compromise and the possibility of a successful outcome. 
* **Final Push for Agreement:** This is likely the last counteroffer I'll make before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think $9000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $8800. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time and Potential Loss:** We're nearing the end of our negotiations, and it's becoming clear that Bob might not be willing to reach a price that meets my minimum.
* **John Offers a Secure Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $10,000. It's a risk-free way to ensure I get a good deal. 
* **Risk of a Counterproductive Counteroffer:** There's a risk that a counteroffer to Bob will lead to further back-and-forth, potentially ending with a lower price or a stalemate.

While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, it's important to secure the best outcome for myself in this limited-time scenario.  Selling to John is the most logical and financially secure choice."
