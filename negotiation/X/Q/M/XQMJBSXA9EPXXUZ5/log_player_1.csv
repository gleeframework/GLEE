Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd ideally like to get, but still within the range of what I consider acceptable. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still trying to get closer to my minimum price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll keep negotiating with Bob for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $110 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is a fair compromise. This allows you to get a good deal, and me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

I'm making a small concession, hoping to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price.  At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum and want to see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'll keep trying to negotiate with Bob for a higher price.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm determined to get the best possible price.  John is still an option if I can't close with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $115 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $118. This is a small difference, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 118} 
``` 

I'm making a very small concession, hoping to finally reach a deal with Bob. At this point, I'm getting a little nervous about John, but I'm determined to get the best possible price."
