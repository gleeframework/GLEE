{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 12000. How about we meet in the middle at 13500? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 13000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 13250? I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.
