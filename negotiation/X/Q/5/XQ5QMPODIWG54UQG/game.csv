As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
