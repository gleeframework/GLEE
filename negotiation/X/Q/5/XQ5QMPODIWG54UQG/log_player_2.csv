"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is a bit high.  I'll reject and counter to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the opening offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being a good deal if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $9,500?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference with this counter-offer, showing Alice that we're willing to negotiate but also standing firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,200. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, which means we're getting closer to her limit.  I'll push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice.  How about we settle right in the middle at $9,850?"",
""product_price"": 9850
}
``` 

This offer shows Alice we're willing to compromise, but we're also making it clear we're aiming for that middle ground. It might be tempting to go lower, but with time ticking away, finding a middle ground sooner rather than later might be the best approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,100. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting close to the wire. Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $10,000 as possible. While I might be able to squeeze out another hundred dollars, it's getting risky, and $10,100 is still a solid deal. I'll accept."
