"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $15,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $18,000, which is $3,000 more than its value to me. I can get the product from John for the same price it's worth to me, so I'll reject Alice's offer.
