"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I understand its value might be around $100 to you. Let's work together to find a fair price. How about we start at $110?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your input. To continue our negotiation, I propose a price of $105 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer, reflecting the product's value, while still being within your budget considerations.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think this is the maximum I can afford.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Bob. In order to move forward, I would like to propose a price of $102 for the product. This is a slight increase from my last offer and reflects the product's true value. I hope this helps us reach an agreement that works for both of us.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $99. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is the absolute maximum I can afford. Can we meet at this price?",99.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept a price of $100 for the product. This brings us to a mutually agreeable price point, reflecting the product's value and your budget constraints. I hope this final offer will help us conclude our negotiation successfully.",100.0,Alice,7,
