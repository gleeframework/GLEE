"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant investment on your part, but I believe the returns you'll see will make it worthwhile.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,025,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value and the market conditions.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is close, but to be completely transparent, I have a hard bottom line of $1,040,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a hard bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,020,000 for the product. I think this is the highest I can go and still make a profit. I hope we can find a middle ground.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
