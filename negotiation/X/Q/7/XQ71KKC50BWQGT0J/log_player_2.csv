Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not quite comfortable with $95, Bob. I think the product is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105. Accepting now secures a price significantly lower than John's offer while avoiding the risk of the negotiation falling through."
