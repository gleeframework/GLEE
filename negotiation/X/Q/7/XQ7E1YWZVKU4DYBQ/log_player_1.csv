Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to try and get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000. I'm thinking of $1,500,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. This is the best deal I can get right now, and I want to close the deal."
