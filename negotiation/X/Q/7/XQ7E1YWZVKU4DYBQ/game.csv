"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to sell the product for $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's work together to find a solution.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
