"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially since Alice's offer is still fairly high.  By rejecting, Bob can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point.  Bob is showing that he's serious about buying the product, but he's also willing to walk away if Alice isn't willing to budge much further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

While Alice has come down in price, it's still not at the ideal point for Bob.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again could potentially lead to a price closer to Bob's desired range."

Bob is continuing to try and find a middle ground.  This counteroffer is a modest increase from his previous one, but it's still below Alice's current price.  This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price doesn't become more favorable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is clearly not budging much further. The price is only slightly lower than her previous offer, and it's now higher than Bob's last counter-offer. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase from John for $1,000,000.  This ensures that Bob gets the product while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential stalemate."
