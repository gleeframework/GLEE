"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is $11,500. There's room to negotiate.  By rejecting, you can test if Alice is willing to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $11,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $11250? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still higher than you'd like to pay. There's still room to negotiate. By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about getting a better deal, and you can see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target.  How about $11,100?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I can offer you a deal at $11200, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're serious about getting a good deal, this is your best chance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, and is now offering $11,200, which is only $200 more than your last counteroffer. It's worth it to accept this offer and get a better price than John's $12,000 offer. This is a good deal for both of you, as you're saving $800 and Alice is selling the product for a price slightly above her minimum."
