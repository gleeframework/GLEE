{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit above my budget.  How about $10500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I can do better than $10,500. I'll counter with a lower price and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and would allow me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10750.  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you too. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,250, which is a fair compromise and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
