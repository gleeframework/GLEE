"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit above my budget.  How about $10500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and would allow me to make a profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10750.  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you too.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $11250, which is a fair compromise and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
