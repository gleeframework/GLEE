"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $10,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $11,750. This is my best compromise at this point.",11750.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to be closer to my minimum of $12,000. How about we meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm on a tight budget.  $11,250 is my final offer - if it doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",11250.0,Bob,6,
