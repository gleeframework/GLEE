"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. I believe this price reflects the value this product brings while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $837,500. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",837500.0,Alice,5,
