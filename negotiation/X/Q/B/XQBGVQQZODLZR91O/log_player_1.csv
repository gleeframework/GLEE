""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it significantly above this is unlikely to work.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still securing a price well above our guaranteed sale. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that the product will be offered elsewhere encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
