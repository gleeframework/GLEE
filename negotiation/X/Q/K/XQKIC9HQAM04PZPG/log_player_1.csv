Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a premium. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Potential Loss Aversion:** By offering a price significantly higher than his perceived value, Bob might be more enticed to negotiate rather than risk losing the opportunity entirely. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance, you might choose a different opening offer."
