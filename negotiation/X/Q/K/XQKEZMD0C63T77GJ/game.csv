"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly unique and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. I'm asking for $1000000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900000.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand we're getting closer, but $850000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $875000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $10000 if you can meet me at $860000. Can you consider my offer?",860000.0,Bob,6,
