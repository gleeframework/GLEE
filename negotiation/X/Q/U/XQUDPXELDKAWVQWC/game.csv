"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows for a substantial profit for you. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so I'm offering $775,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
