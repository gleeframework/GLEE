"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I think a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000, so how about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with. Can we agree on that?",13500.0,Bob,6,
