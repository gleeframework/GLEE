Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at a price of $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask, but still considerably more than my minimum. I see an opportunity to negotiate further.
