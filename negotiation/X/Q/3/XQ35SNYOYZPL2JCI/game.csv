"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm looking for something a bit closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile for me. I'm confident this product will bring you great value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a better price than $9,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
