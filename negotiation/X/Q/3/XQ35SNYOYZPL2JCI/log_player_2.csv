"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's initial offer is closer to his maximum budget of $8,000.  He doesn't want to go too low and risk Alice rejecting the offer completely.
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $9,000 provides room for negotiation without making a significantly lower offer that Alice might reject.

**Next Steps:** This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiations.  Alice will either accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of her own."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm looking for something a bit closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile for me. I'm confident this product will bring you great value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  There's still room for compromise.

**Next Steps:** Bob should make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget, keeping in mind that he can always choose to buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a better price than $9,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise, but it's still below Alice's offer.  
* **Maximum Limit:**  Bob has stated his maximum budget, making it clear that he won't go any higher.
* **Compromise:**  The offer is a halfway point between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous offer,  showing that he's trying to reach a middle ground.

**Next Steps:** This counteroffer creates pressure on Alice to either accept or make a final counteroffer. Bob should be prepared to walk away if the price doesn't drop to his acceptable range."
