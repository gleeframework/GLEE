Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60."", ""product_price"": 60} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a low offer, you're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** You've signaled your interest while making it clear that Alice needs to come down significantly in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $100 is still above your budget and what you're willing to pay. You have time to negotiate further, and there's no rush to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, $80 is the absolute highest I could go for this product."", ""product_price"": 80}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer makes it clear that $80 is your maximum budget. You're being firm without being confrontational.
* **Transparency:** By stating your top price, you're being transparent with Alice and avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth.
* **John as a Backup:** Remember, you have the option of buying from John for $80 if Alice completely refuses to budge. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
