"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my minimum selling price.  I hope we can reach an agreement. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your position. Let's try $10,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. If you're not comfortable with this, I'm going to have to look at other options.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us, and I really want to make this deal happen. ",10500.0,Alice,7,
