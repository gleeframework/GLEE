"Bob, I understand your desire to save, and I'm happy to continue discussing this. However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000, which is still a significant saving for you compared to the true worth of the product. This price point allows for a mutually beneficial outcome and ensures we both achieve our goals.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
