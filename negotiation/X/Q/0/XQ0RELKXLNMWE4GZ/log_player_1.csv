Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While I'm willing to sell to John for $100, I think I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $100 for the product. This is a fair price that meets both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 100}
