"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product has significant value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could you consider $725,000? That would be a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
