"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my initial asking price.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and reducing the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the budget. However,  $950,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential impact on your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the value of the product, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider a price of $1,025,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
