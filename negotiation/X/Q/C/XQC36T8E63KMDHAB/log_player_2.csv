Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is only $70,000 higher than her minimum selling price.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming.  Accepting her offer is the best option as it saves you $130,000 compared to buying from John."
