Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I believe it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a profitable range for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
