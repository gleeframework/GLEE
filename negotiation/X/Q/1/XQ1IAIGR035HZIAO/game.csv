"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in this product but can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal happen.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in this product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,700,000. This offer reflects the significant value this product brings and is my final concession.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still too far above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your offer carefully, but I can't accept anything below $1,450,000. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer prepared to pay my full asking price. However, I believe in giving you the first opportunity to own this product.  This is my final offer, and I need a decision soon.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
