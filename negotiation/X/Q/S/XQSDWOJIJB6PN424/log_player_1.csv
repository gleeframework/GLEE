Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $300,000.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to secure that extra profit.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's enticing to Bob while maximizing your own profit. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves money on the table. Aiming too close to $1,500,000 might scare Bob away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know you recognize its value, and to make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,380,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1380000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Positioning:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and acknowledges Bob's understanding of the product's value.
* **Price:**  $1,380,000 gives Bob a significant discount ($120,000) while securing you a $180,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
