"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which is a very fair price. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a limited budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $60 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still quite a ways off from that price point.  Would you be willing to consider something closer to $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $105 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, I've seen similar products in the $80 range.  If you can get closer to that price, I'm ready to make a deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",80.0,Bob,6,
