"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way too high. You know you can get it for $100 from John, and you should aim to get a much better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's more reasonable. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation and signal that her initial price was unrealistic. 
* **Polite & Interested:** The message aims to be polite and express continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, we aim to move the negotiation closer to our desired price range. Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives us a better starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $150 represents a fair price, I understand you'd like to meet somewhere in the middle. How about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to an acceptable price, $130 is still too high. We know we have a backup option at $100, so there's room to negotiate further. By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $130 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to do $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We are increasing our offer, but strategically staying significantly below her price to keep the negotiation moving in our favor.
* **Justification:** Providing a vague reason like ""budget-friendly"" strengthens our position without revealing too much about our willingness to pay.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** We're aiming for a price point that's a compromise between her previous offer and our initial counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still working towards our goal."
