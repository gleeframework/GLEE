"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,300,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I can do $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I think this is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
