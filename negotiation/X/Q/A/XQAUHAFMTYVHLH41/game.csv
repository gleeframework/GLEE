"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. I'm open to further discussions and hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
