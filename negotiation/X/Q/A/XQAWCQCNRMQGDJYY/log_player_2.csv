You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer. I can get the product from John for $1,500,000, which is more than Alice's offer. I want to save as much money as possible, so I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
