"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting a little tight for me.  I could do $9,800, but that's really as high as I can go.",9800.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll offer it to you for $10,500 again, but this is my last offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
