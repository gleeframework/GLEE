Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll offer it to you for $10,500 again, but this is my last offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has gone up in price from her previous offer and seems firm. It's unlikely she'll go below $10,200, which is still above our target. Buying from John for $12,000 ensures we get the product without further risk of negotiation failure."
