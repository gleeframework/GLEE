"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a reasonable compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $10,125? It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a significant value for the product. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing we're getting closer. How about we make it a clean $10,000? It's a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
