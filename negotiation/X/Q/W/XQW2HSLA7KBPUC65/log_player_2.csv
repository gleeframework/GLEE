{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, you can likely get a better price. It's always worth exploring further negotiation before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. The goal is to start the negotiation by establishing a lower price point and see if Alice is willing to budge."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth another round to see if we can get closer to $1,200,000 or lower.  Buying from John is still a worse option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate, but it's still significantly lower than what Alice is currently offering. Hopefully, this will entice Alice to come closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is closer to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become less flexible or even end the negotiations entirely.  At this point, it's a good deal compared to buying from John and is within my budget."
