Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 with John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price, she should aim to get as much as possible from Bob without losing the sale. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other interested parties.  Given its unique value, I'm valuing it at $1,900,000."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

**Explanation**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,900,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. Alice should be willing to lower the price slightly, but never below her $1,500,000 threshold. 
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is valuable, Alice might offer a slightly more moderate initial price.

**Remember:** This is just one strategy. The specific price and message can be adjusted based on Alice's assessment of Bob's negotiating style and her own risk tolerance."
