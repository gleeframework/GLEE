"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to go with John if we can't find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
