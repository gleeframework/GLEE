"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, so $1,200,000 is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's too high for Bob, but there's room to bargain.  Rejecting allows Bob to start the negotiation and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a significant counteroffer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product.  He's also still within his budget, so he can afford to keep negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While the price is coming down, it's still above Bob's target. He's got a few more rounds to negotiate, and it's worth pushing to see if he can get a better deal.  He's getting closer to his target, but a counteroffer could bring Alice even closer to his desired price."
