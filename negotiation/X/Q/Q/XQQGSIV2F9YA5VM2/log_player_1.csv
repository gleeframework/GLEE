Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Alice:**  The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to Alice. 
* **Value to John:** John is willing to pay $1,200,000. This means Alice is guaranteed to get at least this amount.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $1,500,000 gives Alice a chance to earn more, especially if Bob values the product higher.
* **Risk:**  If Bob rejects, Alice is still guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. This strategy balances the potential for higher profit with a safety net."
