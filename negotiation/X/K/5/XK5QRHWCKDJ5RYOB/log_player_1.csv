Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
Here's why this is a good strategy for Alice:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $120. By offering it for $110, she aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a feeling of getting a good deal ($10 savings).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is high, it doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of Bob attempting to negotiate a slightly lower price.
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has a fallback option with John who is willing to pay $80. This ensures she won't be forced to accept a very low offer from Bob."
