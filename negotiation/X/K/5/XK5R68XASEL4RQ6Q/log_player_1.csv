Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200} 
```

This offer is based on a strategy of ""aspiring high"" and leveraging John's guaranteed offer as a safety net.  

Here's the reasoning:

* **Value Unknown:** Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $200 leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  If Bob rejects, I can confidently sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose out. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
