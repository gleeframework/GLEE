"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $750000 doesn't reflect the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a price of $875000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
