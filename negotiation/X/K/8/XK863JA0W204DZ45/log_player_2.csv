"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects its worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $850,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000, and her language suggests this is her final offer.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take the guaranteed saving."
