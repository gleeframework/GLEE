Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $125, and it's not worth risking a higher price.  You can get the product for a sure $120 from John."
