"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter offer attempts to anchor the negotiation significantly closer to our target price. It leaves room for further negotiation but also signals that we are serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85?  It's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming lower. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and make it $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

We're proposing a price exactly between our last offer and her counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal."
