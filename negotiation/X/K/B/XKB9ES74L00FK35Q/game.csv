I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $9250? This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while giving you a decent return.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9250 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9800. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9800.0,Alice,5,
