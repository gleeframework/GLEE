"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is around $1500000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
