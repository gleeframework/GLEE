"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down to $10500, which is a fair compromise given the value this product offers. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find common ground. To be honest, $9200 isn't quite there yet for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, so how about $9600? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally get this deal done.",9600.0,Alice,7,
