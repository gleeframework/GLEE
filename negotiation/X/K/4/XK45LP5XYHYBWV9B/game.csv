"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $12500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $12250. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it!",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $12250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $11500 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $12000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to budge any further. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
