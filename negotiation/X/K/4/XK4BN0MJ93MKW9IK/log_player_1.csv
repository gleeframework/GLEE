Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. What do you say to a price of $130?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Start by aiming high. Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($100) and John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $130 leaves space for Bob to haggle a little, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still getting you a good profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting above your minimum, you establish the product's value and increase the perceived value for Bob. 

This approach aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while still being appealing enough that he's likely to accept."
