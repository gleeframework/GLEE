"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to your business, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a one-time offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than John's price, it's still significantly higher than your $1,500,000 limit. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal."
