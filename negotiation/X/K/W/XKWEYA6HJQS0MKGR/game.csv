"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to propose a price of $950,000, which still gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional item. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both parties, allowing me to purchase the product and you to make a good profit.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000. I'm still a bit higher than my target price. To bridge the gap, I'd like to offer $1,020,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1020000.0,Bob,6,
