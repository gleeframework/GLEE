"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a bit over my budget at $160.  How about we settle on $140? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it then.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle on $152? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product!",152.0,Alice,5,
