I'm still aiming for a higher price. Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."

While closer to my desired price, I'll aim a bit higher still. Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests he might go a little higher."

Round 6

It's time to accept. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and this offer is a good deal better than John's guaranteed $15,000."
