"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify the price of $12,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
