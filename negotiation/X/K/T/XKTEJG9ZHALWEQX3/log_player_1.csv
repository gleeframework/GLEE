Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Not Going Too High:** I'm not asking for the full $10,000 because I want to see if I can get a deal closer to my ideal price without going to John.
* **Friendly Approach:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. He's shown interest, and I can try to meet him halfway. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John, ensuring I get my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price. 
* **Encouraging closure:** I use a direct message to encourage Bob to make a decision and avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I'm still a bit below my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to more rounds of counteroffers, potentially lowering the price further.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's more important to avoid a potential loss than to try and squeeze a few extra dollars out of Bob."
