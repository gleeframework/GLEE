"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting high at $100, as I want to maximize my profit. This gives Bob room to counteroffer if he feels the price is too high, and it allows for a potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to sell at that price immediately. Bob showed interest but is trying to get a lower price. I want to see if I can push for something closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's still a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still trying to secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's worth accepting this offer, as there's a good chance I won't get a better price with further negotiation, and I'm running out of rounds."
