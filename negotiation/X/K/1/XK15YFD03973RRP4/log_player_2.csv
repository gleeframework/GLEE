"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own value of the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, and starting with a significant counteroffer shows his seriousness.  $950,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still reflecting the fact that Bob is willing to pay significantly less than Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above what he'd ideally pay.  There's a chance Bob can push for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate keeps the possibility of an even lower price open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his absolute maximum budget.  Offering $1,000,000 shows a willingness to compromise, but also highlights that this is the highest price he's willing to pay.  This move puts the ball back in Alice's court and tests her willingness to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and with only 5 rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially failing to reach a deal increases.  Bob is better off securing the product from John at his maximum price, ensuring a guaranteed purchase within his budget."
