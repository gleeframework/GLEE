"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
