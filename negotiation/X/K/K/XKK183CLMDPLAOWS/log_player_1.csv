Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures you make a significant profit if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John gives you leverage. You don't need to desperately bargain with Bob. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly."
