This price reflects a fair compromise between its value to both of us and ensures a satisfactory transaction for all parties involved. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

You can get the product from John for $8,000, which is less than Alice's offer of $12,000. So, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
