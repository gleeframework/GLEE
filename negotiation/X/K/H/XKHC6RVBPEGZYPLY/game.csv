"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a good value for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. This is a significant step towards reaching an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $980,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",980000.0,Alice,5,
