"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a good value for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're comfortable with.  While it's closer to your desired price point, you can likely push for a lower price with a counteroffer. There's still a gap between Alice's offer and your maximum price.  Negotiating further is likely to yield a better deal than accepting her current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. This is a significant step towards reaching an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $980,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is close to your counteroffer of $950,000.  It's a fair compromise that's within your budget and saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer is the most financially advantageous choice."
