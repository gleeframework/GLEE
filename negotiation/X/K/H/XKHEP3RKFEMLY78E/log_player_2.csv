"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There are still 9 rounds left, so you have time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is $10 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer if she wants to compromise. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to accept this offer, as it still gives her a profit of $10."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is within my budget and a good deal considering John is selling for $150. It's a decent compromise, and I'm happy to accept the offer."
