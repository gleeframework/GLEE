Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a bit higher than my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested.  I'll see if he's willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my initial price of $150. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $135. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where we can both agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

Bob is insistent on $120, and while it's not my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
