Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum price of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a good deal, especially compared to selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's a reasonable compromise and worth accepting at this point."
