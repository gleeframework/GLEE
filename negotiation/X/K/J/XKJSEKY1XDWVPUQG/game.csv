"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's significantly less than that.  I understand this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile one. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
