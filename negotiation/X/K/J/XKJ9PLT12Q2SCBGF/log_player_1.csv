"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. It's a bit of a gamble, but I want to see how interested Bob is in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$7,000 is way too low for me. I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, but I'm keeping that option open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob and get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is still too low for me. I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob, but I'm starting to get nervous that he's not really interested in paying much more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm coming down to $9,000. It's closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
