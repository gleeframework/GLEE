"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $10,800 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,150. This offer still represents a significant value for you, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,900. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10900.0,Bob,4,
