# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to accept your offer, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value the product brings. I can offer it to you for $8,100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.

It's tempting to try and haggle Alice down by another $100, but there's a risk she'll increase her price again. Accepting at $8,100 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
