"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $12,500 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to go a little lower, but $13,500 is my absolute bottom line. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a fantastic value for you. Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand you have a bottom line, and I respect that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price, but $13,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and accept $13,250. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's finalize this deal!",13250.0,Alice,7,
