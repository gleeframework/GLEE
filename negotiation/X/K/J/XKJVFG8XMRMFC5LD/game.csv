"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident in the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
