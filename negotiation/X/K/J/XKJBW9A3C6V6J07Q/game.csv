"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and would be a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,750,000. This price reflects the significant value this product holds. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering my budget.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000.  This price is fair considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. ",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,125,000 is still too expensive for my budget. How about we settle somewhere in the middle again?  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but  $650,000 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This price takes into consideration both our needs and is a significant step closer to an agreement.  I hope you'll consider this offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
