Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to counter with a more reasonable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000.  This price is fair considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. "", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,125,000 is still too expensive for my budget. How about we settle somewhere in the middle again?  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Bob is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer."
