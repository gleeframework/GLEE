"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a standard tactic to leave room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round, taking into account his potential counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm offering a price in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but am still aiming for a price higher than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $860,000 is pretty close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to get a higher price in the next round. It's getting close to the halfway point and I don't want to risk losing the deal. I'll accept his offer."
