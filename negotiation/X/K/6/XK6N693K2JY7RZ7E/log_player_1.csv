Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. At this point, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is very small.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially getting even less.  Accepting John's offer guarantees you meet your minimum and avoids further haggling."
