Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll agree. To be fair, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000 before I consider other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, starting with a higher offer of $1,500,000 maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification of Value:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, potentially piquing Bob's interest and justifying the high price. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning ""other potential buyers"" create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** While this is an aggressive starting point, it's possible Bob might be willing to pay a premium if the product's value proposition aligns perfectly with his needs.  If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000."
