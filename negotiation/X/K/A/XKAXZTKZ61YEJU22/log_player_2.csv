"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John is selling for, you can likely get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $100.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a reasonable starting point.  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum selling price. This shows a willingness to negotiate and might encourage her to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you'd like to pay. It's closer to your desired price, but there's still room to negotiate. You're better off continuing to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still too high.  By offering $115, you're showing a willingness to meet her halfway but also reminding her that you are serious about getting a good price.  This is a reasonable middle ground and could lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to your ideal price, you've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and there's still some room to get a lower price.  You're still much closer to Alice's desired price than John's, so it's worthwhile to keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps coming down, but her offers are still a bit too high.  By offering $120, you're essentially meeting her halfway again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This could lead to a deal in the next round.  If she rejects, you'll need to seriously consider buying from John, as you're running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price.  You're running out of rounds, and there's a high chance Alice won't budge any further. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $150.  This ensures you get the product within the allowed rounds, and the price difference is only $5 more than Alice's last offer."
