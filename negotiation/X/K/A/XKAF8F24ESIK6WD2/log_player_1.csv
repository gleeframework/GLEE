Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $160 to start the conversation. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I believe the product is quite valuable, but I am only willing to pay up to $120. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the absolute maximum he's willing to pay, which is still less than what John is guaranteed to pay. There's no room for negotiation to get a better price from Bob, so it makes the most sense to sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
