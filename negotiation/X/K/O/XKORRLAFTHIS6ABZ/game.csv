"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is a fair price, considering the product's value. Let's make a deal!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $92 is still too low for me.  Let's try $98. I'm really trying to work with you here, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. What do you say?",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, and I think $95 is a more reasonable offer. Can you meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,8,
