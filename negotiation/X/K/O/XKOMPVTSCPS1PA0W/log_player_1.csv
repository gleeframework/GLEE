Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob as he values the product at $12,000. This approach allows for potential back-and-forth to see if you can close the deal closer to your ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my ideal price and is still a significant profit. Accepting his offer secures the deal and avoids further negotiation."
