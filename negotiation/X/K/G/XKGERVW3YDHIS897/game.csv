"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this is acceptable.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to make this deal work. This price still allows me some profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value of my product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
