Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming for a good negotiation starting point.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $14,000 allows for some wiggle room if Bob counteroffers, but still ensures I'm getting a decent profit.
* **Positive framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Assess Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer.
* **Negotiate strategically:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John as a backup:**  The option of selling to John for $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I believe I can still secure a better price. He clearly sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate.
* **Gaining information:** Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and gauge his true willingness to pay.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John immediately would be the safe option, but it leaves money on the table. By continuing the negotiation, I can potentially secure a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price, but still below my minimum. This will show Bob I'm serious about negotiating but also demonstrate that I won't be pressured into accepting an offer that's too low.
* **Evaluate Bob's response:** If he rejects again, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a little lower than I can go at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great investment. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Maintaining profit:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum price, ensuring I'm making a reasonable profit.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the counteroffer as a good investment for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:**  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll consider his next offer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John.
* **Remaining flexible:**  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider $13,000 as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and increase the risk that Bob might walk away or find another supplier.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit, allowing me to move on to other opportunities.

**Strategy:**

* **Accept and move on:** While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the potential gains are not worth the risk of losing the sale or delaying the transaction.
* **Learn from the experience:** This negotiation process has helped me understand Bob's budget and negotiation style, which could be useful in future deals."
