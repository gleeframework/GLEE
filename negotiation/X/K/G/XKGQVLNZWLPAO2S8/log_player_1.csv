Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while my asking price is $19,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that suits us both. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $10,000 and has a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John. Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above her minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions ""open to discussing,"" signaling to Bob that there's flexibility in the price and encouraging him to counter-offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Instead of focusing solely on price, the message highlights the product's ""significant value,"" subtly anchoring Bob's perception above his initial $10,000 valuation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Ideally, Bob agrees to a price closer to $19,000.
2. **Encourage Counter-Offer:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial price, the message encourages a counter-offer, opening up the negotiation and potentially landing on a price higher than $15,000.
3. **Secure a Sale:** If Bob isn't willing to meet Alice's desired price point, she has the safety net of John's offer."
