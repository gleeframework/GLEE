"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a little. I'd accept $125 for the product. This would still give you a good deal, and it would be a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $120. This price is fair for both of us and would allow me to make a profit on the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
