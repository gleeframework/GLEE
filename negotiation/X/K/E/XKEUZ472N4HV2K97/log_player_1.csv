Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce to Bob that the price is justified.
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting at other potential buyers (""listing it publicly"") can create a sense of urgency and competition for Bob. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
