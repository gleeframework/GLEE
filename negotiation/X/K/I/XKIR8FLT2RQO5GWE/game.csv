"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $950,000. However, I'm aiming for a lower price point to make this purchase worthwhile for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which still leaves a good profit for you.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price that still leaves a significant profit for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that gives you a healthy profit and allows me to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $920,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still outside my target range.  I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while still meeting my needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to budge from my previous offer of $920,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a premium support package, which is worth an additional $20,000. This brings the total value to $940,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the added benefits. What do you think?",940000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but $940,000 is still above my target price. I'm committed to staying within my budget, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $875,000, which includes the warranty and support package.  I believe this is a fair price that offers you a good profit and keeps me within my budget. Let's work together to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still committed to your budget, but I'm starting to lose patience. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $900,000, but I need you to agree to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to protect the product's intellectual property. This is a one-time offer, and I expect a decision from you now.",900000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to protect the product's intellectual property, but I'm not comfortable with the NDA at this price point.  I'm willing to offer $890,000 for the product without the NDA. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and it's the best I can do within my budget. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to explore other options.",890000.0,Bob,10,
