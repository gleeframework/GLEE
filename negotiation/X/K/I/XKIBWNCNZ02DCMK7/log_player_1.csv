Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $6,500?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,250. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 8250}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $7,625?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $7,200? That's a fair compromise in my mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try $7,400. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 7400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $7,300. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not comfortable accepting Bob's final offer.  I'm also concerned that if I reject it, he may walk away and I'll be left with no deal at all.  Since John is offering my minimum, it's safer to sell to him and guarantee the transaction."
