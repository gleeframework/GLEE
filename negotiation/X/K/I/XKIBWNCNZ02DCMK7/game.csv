"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,250. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While that price is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $7,625?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",7625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $7,200? That's a fair compromise in my mind.",7200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try $7,400. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",7400.0,Alice,7,
