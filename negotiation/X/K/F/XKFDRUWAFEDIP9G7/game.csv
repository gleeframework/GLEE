"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it works better for my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
