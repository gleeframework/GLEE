Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
