"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit too high at $11,500.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,000?  That's a good price for me and still gives you a profit.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
