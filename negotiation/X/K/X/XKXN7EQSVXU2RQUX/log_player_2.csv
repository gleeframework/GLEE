# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still more than the product is worth to him, and he can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,500 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While $11,250 is still more than he was hoping to pay, it's significantly lower than John's price and a better deal than his last counteroffer. It's likely Alice won't go any lower, so this is the best he can do in this negotiation."
