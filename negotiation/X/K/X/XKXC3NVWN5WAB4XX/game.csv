"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make another move to $15,000.  This is already quite a reduction, reflecting my desire to see this benefit you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
