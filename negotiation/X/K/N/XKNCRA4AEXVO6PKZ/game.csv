"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $750,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $800,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
