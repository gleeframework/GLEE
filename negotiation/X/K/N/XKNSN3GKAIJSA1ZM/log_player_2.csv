"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down to a more reasonable price closer to my $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my actual limit ($80). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a better deal than John's $80 offer.
* **Gauging Flexibility:**  This lowball offer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. Her reaction will guide my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Limit:** While Alice came down from her initial offer, $90 is still above my $80 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left, and her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I can always fall back on John's $80 offer if needed, but it's too early to use that option now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $90 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:**  I'm increasing my offer to $75, signaling that I'm willing to move closer to her price.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Suggesting $75 aims to ""split the difference"" between her $90 offer and my previous $60 offer.  This can be a persuasive negotiation tactic.
* **Below Limit, Above John:** My offer stays below my $80 limit but is still a more attractive proposition for Alice compared to John's $80 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference at $85? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Limit:** $85 is still $5 above my maximum budget.
* **Close to John:** At this point, Alice's offer is only slightly better than John's guaranteed $80 price. 
* **Potential for Concession:** Alice seems motivated to sell, and with more rounds left, she might be willing to drop her price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, my absolute top limit is $80. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to buy it right now."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm revealing my true maximum budget of $80. This signals that I'm serious about buying but won't go any higher.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""I'm ready to buy it right now,"" I create a sense of urgency and emphasize the potential for an immediate deal.
* **Close to Agreement:**  We're only $5 apart at this point, and Alice has consistently shown a willingness to negotiate.  This offer might be enough to seal the deal."
