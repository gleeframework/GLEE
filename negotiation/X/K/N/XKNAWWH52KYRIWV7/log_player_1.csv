"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a strategic move to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum value of $8,000 and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate.  I'll use this opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 to Bob. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.  If Bob accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll evaluate the situation based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum price. Accepting this offer secures a sale and ensures I don't risk losing out on this deal by continuing to negotiate."
