"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to you, you have room to bargain.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive but still within a reasonable range.  This will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and hopefully push her towards a more favorable price for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her offer is getting closer to my target.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but still keeping it well below Alice's last offer.  This keeps the pressure on Alice to come down on her price while demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement."
