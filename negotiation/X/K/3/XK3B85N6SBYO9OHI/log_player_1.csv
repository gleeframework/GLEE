Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering it for a price significantly lower than $15,000 might raise Bob's suspicions or make him think the product is flawed. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000."
