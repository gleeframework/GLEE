Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $90 is still too low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there at $95.  I'm willing to go down to $98, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price that gives you a good deal, but also ensures I get a decent return on my investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $98. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, it's clear that Bob isn't going to go much higher than $92. I've already lowered my price significantly from my initial asking price. Rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially going even lower, I'm going to sell to John for $120. It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum requirement."
