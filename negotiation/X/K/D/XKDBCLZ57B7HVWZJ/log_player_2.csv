"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1050000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,150,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,000,000.
* **It's a compromise:** Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is not a better option:** While John offers a lower price, accepting Alice's offer would still result in a lower price than John's offer.

Bob should accept Alice's offer to get the product within his budget and save more than he would by buying from John."
