"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $130.  This is more than you're willing to pay. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $115. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $115 is still higher than my maximum budget of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I will need to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $115 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $112. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $112 is still above my maximum budget of $100. While I could potentially counteroffer again, it's likely we'll be stuck in a back-and-forth. I'm better off buying the product from John for $100, ensuring I get it within my budget."
