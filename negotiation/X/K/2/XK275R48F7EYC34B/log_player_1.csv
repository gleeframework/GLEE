Explanation:

Bob seems anchored to his $1,200,000 offer and is showing signs of losing interest.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer is a loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. 

Therefore, it's strategically the best option to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000 rather than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with a diminishing chance of a significantly better outcome."
