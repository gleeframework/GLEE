"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150. 
* However, you know you can get the product for $150 from John if you reject Alice's offer. 
* There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price in a future round to avoid losing the sale. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal."
