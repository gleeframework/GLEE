Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $22,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, and for recognizing the value of this product.  I can go as low as $14,000 - this is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $14,000 is closer, my budget really only allows for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and it's not worth risking a lower offer in further rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $15,000 which is the minimum I'm willing to accept."
