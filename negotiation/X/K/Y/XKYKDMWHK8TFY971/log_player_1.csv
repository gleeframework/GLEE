{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my highest price point. This is because:

* **Maximizing my profit:**  This gives me the best chance of getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Setting the tone:**  Starting high shows that I'm confident in the value of the product. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I have room to lower the price in future counteroffers.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made the most money.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth my time to continue negotiating with him or if it's better to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to take $120, I'm not desperate for a sale.  

* **John's offer is better:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum price.
* **Negotiation potential:** I can still make a counteroffer to Bob, potentially getting a price closer to my goal.

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum, while also keeping John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a compromise:** My counteroffer is a step closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining my minimum:**  $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Framing the offer:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to decide whether to accept his offer (if he counteroffers), make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a better deal with John. 

* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and don't have to continue negotiating.
* **Time is valuable:**  Further negotiation with Bob might not yield a significantly better price and could take more time. 

**Next steps:**

I'll sell the product to John and move on to other opportunities."
