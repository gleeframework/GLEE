Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob has offered the minimum price I'm willing to accept.  It's a good deal for both of us, and we're close to a deal.  It's not worth risking losing this sale to continue the negotiation."
