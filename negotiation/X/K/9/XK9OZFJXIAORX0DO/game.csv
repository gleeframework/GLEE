"Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd need to come in lower. How about $10,000? It's still a fair price for the product and would be a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that my product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000? This is a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, but I'm going to have to pass at this price.  Let me know if you change your mind and are willing to go lower.  Otherwise, I'll be looking elsewhere.",11000.0,Bob,6,
