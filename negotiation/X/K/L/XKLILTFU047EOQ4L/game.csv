"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm thinking of a price of $12000 for this product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.

"I've already made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. This is my final concession, so I hope we can agree on this price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I've already made several concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're not on the same page. I'm going to make one last offer, and if it's not accepted, I'll have to consider other options. I'll sell the product to you for $9500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,9,
