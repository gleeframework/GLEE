"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, hoping to get a good starting point. It's a reasonable markup from my minimum, and I'm confident Bob will be interested given the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer, and closer to my desired price.  I think this is a fair offer and a good chance to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $110. This is a good price, considering I'm getting more than my minimum and Bob is getting a discount from my initial offer. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether. I don't want to risk losing the deal to John, especially since he's offering my minimum price."
