"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($800,000 vs $1,200,000).
* This suggests she is willing to negotiate, and there's potential to get a better price.
* Buying from John at $1,200,000 is the worst option, as it's the full price. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering gives Bob leverage to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice's offer was quite low, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. 
* My counter-offer of $950,000 is a significant increase from her initial offer but still leaves room for further bargaining. 
* This counter-offer shows I'm serious about buying the product while still being reasonable, potentially setting the stage for a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has increased her offer to $980,000, which is getting closer to my desired price.
* It's still a good deal for me, as I'm saving $220,000 compared to buying from John.
* Rejecting and counter-offering again might lead to further negotiations, but it risks stalling the deal and losing the opportunity to buy at a reasonable price. 
* Accepting the offer ensures I secure the product at a price that's significantly better than John's offer, within my budget, and without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
