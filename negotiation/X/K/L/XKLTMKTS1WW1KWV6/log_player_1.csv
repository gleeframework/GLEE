Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a great deal for something of this value, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's an opportunity to earn more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price higher than $15,000.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message highlights the product's value without revealing your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your agreement with John. If Bob knew about your guaranteed $15,000 offer, he would have no incentive to negotiate above that price."
