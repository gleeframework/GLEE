Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer ($7,800) would be less profitable than selling to John for $8,000.  It's time to cut bait with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
