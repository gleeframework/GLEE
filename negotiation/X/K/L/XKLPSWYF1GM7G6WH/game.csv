"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price is fair, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford at this time. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise,  considering we're both approaching a middle ground. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
