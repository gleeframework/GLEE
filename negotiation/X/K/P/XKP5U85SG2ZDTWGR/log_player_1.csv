I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a decent starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $15,000, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm prepared to go lower if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer. It still leaves room for negotiation but brings the price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John for $15,000 is a safe bet. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering $14,000. This is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this is enticing enough for Bob to agree, but if not, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I would like to get a better price, the negotiation seems to be going nowhere. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum value and saves me time."
