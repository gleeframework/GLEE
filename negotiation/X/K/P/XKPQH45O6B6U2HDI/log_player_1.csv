This is a good spot to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Meeting your minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 meets the minimum price you need to make the sale worthwhile.
* **Stronger negotiating position:** You successfully moved Bob up from his initial offer of $12,000.
* **Time savings:** Accepting now avoids potential back-and-forth and closes the deal quickly. 

While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving you with John's offer as the only option."
