"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $15,000? I believe this would still provide a good return for you while allowing me to purchase the product at a price I'm comfortable with.",15000.0,Bob,2,
