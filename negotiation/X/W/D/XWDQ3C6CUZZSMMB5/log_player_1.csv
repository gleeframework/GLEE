I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it's above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is a decent price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping Bob will find it acceptable."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,125,000 is a good price and is close enough to my desired amount. It's a solid deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to another buyer."
