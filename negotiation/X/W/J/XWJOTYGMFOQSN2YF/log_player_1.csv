Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $19,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what you could gain from it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($15,000), so you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Starting high:** A starting price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlighting value (not just price):**  The message focuses on the potential benefits for Bob, not just the number. This can make a higher price more palatable.
* **Gauging Bob's interest:**  This initial offer is designed to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects it outright, you haven't lost anything and can move on to John."
