"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing negotiations, $900000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1000000. This price reflects the significant value my product brings to your business. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To find common ground, I'm willing to drop my price to $975000. This leaves some room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen. ",975000.0,Alice,5,
