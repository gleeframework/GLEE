"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,200,000. This means there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, potentially allowing Bob to get a lower price or ultimately buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm  firmly at $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $900000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $1050000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

```

Alice has now offered the same price twice, showing she's unwilling to budge.  This is a sign that further negotiation might be fruitless.  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and buy from John for $800,000, securing the product within his budget."
