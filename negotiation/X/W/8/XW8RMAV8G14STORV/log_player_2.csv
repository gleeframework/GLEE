"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer, and I'd like to start with a price of $9,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's target price.  Bob can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still too high for Bob. He has already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected both. It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth without a significant price drop. Given that John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, which is only slightly higher than Alice's current offer, it's more efficient and less time-consuming for Bob to buy the product from John."
