I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer, and I'd like to start with a price of $9,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.
