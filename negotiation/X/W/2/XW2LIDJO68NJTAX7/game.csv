"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product. I know you value it more, but this is my maximum budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget, the product's value is significantly higher than that. Let's meet in the middle - how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18,000 is still too high. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000.  It's my maximum budget, and I'm happy to walk away if that's not acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your maximum budget, but selling it at $8,000 would be a significant loss for me.  How about we try $15,000? That's already a considerable compromise on my end.",15000.0,Alice,5,
