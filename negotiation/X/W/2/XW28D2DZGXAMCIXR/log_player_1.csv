Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $9,000, which is slightly above the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive and confident:** My message is friendly and expresses confidence in the value of the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to create a sense of urgency. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also being open to a fair deal.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob, but I also have a guaranteed fallback option with John, ensuring I won't settle for less than the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can only pay $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd love to earn more, Bob's offer is exactly the product's value to him, and therefore, it's a fair deal for both of us. Accepting this offer guarantees me the product's worth,  saving time and effort in further negotiation. 

This is a win-win situation as Bob gets the product at a price he's willing to pay, and I get the full value of the product."
