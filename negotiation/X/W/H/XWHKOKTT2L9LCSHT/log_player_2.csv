"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to you is $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so you can aim for a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  This would still be a great deal for both of us, as it's well above your value for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $8,500. Given the value of the product to you and my costs, I am unable to accept a lower price than $9,000. I appreciate your interest and hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still a good deal for me. It's less than what I'd pay John ($10,000) and is closer to the value of the product for Alice ($8,000). Accepting her offer is the most sensible choice as further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or me having to buy from John at a higher price."
