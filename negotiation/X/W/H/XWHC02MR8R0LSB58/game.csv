,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least cover my costs. How about $135? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",132.5,Alice,5,
