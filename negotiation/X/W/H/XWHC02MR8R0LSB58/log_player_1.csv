Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit lower than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition for Bob to make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my expenses within $120. Would you be able to accommodate this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least cover my costs. How about $135? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your cost considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm willing to keep negotiating to try and get a better price, but I'm not going to give up the product for less than $150 without trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
