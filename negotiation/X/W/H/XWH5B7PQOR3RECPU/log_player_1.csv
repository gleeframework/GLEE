Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a slightly risky strategy, but it offers the potential for a higher profit. Here's why:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob is willing to pay $8,000, so anything less than that is a guaranteed loss for me. 
* **My Minimum:**  My minimum acceptable price is $10,000, which is the price I can get from John.
* **Potential for More:**  By offering $9,500, I'm hoping to find a middle ground. Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value to get the product, especially if he feels it's a good deal.

**If Bob rejects, I can move on to John, ensuring I get my minimum price.**"
