"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?  I think that's a fair starting point for further discussion.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $650,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about we discuss a price of $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,000,000 is closer to the value you have in mind, it's still a significant stretch for my budget.  Could we consider $750,000? I believe that represents a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
