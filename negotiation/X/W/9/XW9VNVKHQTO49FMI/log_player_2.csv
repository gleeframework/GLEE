Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $650,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about we discuss a price of $1,000,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,000,000 is closer to the value you have in mind, it's still a significant stretch for my budget.  Could we consider $750,000? I believe that represents a reasonable compromise."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is not budging significantly in her offers. She seems stuck around the $1 million mark. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that makes sense for you (under $800,000) within the remaining rounds.  Cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
