"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal value ($120) than my minimum ($80). This gives me more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open-ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" gives Bob a chance to respond and potentially counter-offer without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Time:** While $80 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. There's still room to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:**  I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90?  I think it's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $100 to $90. This signals that I'm open to negotiating.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to move closer to my price.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Using the word ""fair"" makes the offer sound more reasonable and less aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still within range of potentially getting a better price.
* **More Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still a chance to get Bob to budge a little higher.  
* **Time is on My Side:** I have several rounds left to negotiate, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $85 is closer, but how about we split the difference at $87.50? It's still a great value for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  This shows a willingness to compromise further while still getting a better price than Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal despite the price.
* **Confidence and Closing:** Using phrases like ""great value"" and ""sure you'll be happy"" subtly push Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $85 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've reached a point where Bob is being stubborn, and it seems unlikely he'll budge further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $80 is an option, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. 
* **Time is Running Out:** I have a few rounds left to try to convince Bob. 
* **Possible Shift in Strategy:**  In the next round, I might try a different approach, such as offering something extra to sweeten the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I get where you're coming from, but I'm really not comfortable going lower than $87.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to throw in a bonus [mention a small, valuable bonus item related to the product] to sweeten the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm reiterating my previous offer, showing that I'm committed but still open to discussion.
* **Bonus Incentive:** Adding a small, relevant bonus item can make the offer more appealing without significantly impacting my profit.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price again to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the bonus, but I'm still not comfortable paying $87.50. I'll meet you at $85, and that's my final offer. I'm willing to take the product home today if you accept this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the final rounds, and the negotiation seems to have reached a stalemate. 
* **Close to Minimum:** While I'd prefer a higher price, $85 is very close to my minimum. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** If I reject this offer, I risk losing Bob completely and being forced to sell to John for $80.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting the offer ensures I sell the product and make a reasonable profit, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
