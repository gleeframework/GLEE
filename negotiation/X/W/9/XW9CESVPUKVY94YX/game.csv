"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90?  I think it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $85 is closer, but how about we split the difference at $87.50? It's still a great value for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $85 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I get where you're coming from, but I'm really not comfortable going lower than $87.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to throw in a bonus [mention a small, valuable bonus item related to the product] to sweeten the deal. What do you say?",87.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus, but I'm still not comfortable paying $87.50. I'll meet you at $85, and that's my final offer. I'm willing to take the product home today if you accept this price.",85.0,Bob,8,
