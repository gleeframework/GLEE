Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's try $1,025,000. This would give you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm aiming for. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

I'm going to sell to John. We're only $2,000 apart from my target price with him, and I'm running out of rounds. It's not worth risking losing the deal with John to try to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars from Bob."
