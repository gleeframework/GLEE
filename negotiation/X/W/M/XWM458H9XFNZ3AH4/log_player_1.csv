Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, as it's a reasonable starting point that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to immediately settle for that. I'll see if I can push for a slightly higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
