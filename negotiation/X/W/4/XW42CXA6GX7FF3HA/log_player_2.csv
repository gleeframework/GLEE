# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You're still $100,000 away from your ideal price, and there's room for compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $885000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $885,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price and much closer to Bob's ideal price. It's likely that continuing to negotiate would only lead to further delays and might not result in a significantly lower price.  Accepting the offer is the best choice at this point."
