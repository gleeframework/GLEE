"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to $850000.  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure the price is right for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. $900000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap a bit more. How about $875000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $885000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
