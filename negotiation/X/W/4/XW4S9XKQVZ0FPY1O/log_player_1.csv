Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to leave room for Bob to counteroffer, as this keeps the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I will counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, considering the value you see in the product.  This is a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my minimum. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from John. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000."
