"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and counteroffer. The product is worth $120 to you, and you can get it from John for that price.  You should aim to get closer to that price by making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $140 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and go with $130.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
