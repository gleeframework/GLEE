Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply not feasible for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.
