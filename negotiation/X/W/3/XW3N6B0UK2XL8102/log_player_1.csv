Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get the product while still leaving room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $1,500,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,525,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000. This offer is a good compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's reach a final agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum, and we're running out of rounds.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best option at this point."
