"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply not feasible for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get the product while still leaving room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still firm on my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,525,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000. This offer is a good compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's reach a final agreement at this price.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
