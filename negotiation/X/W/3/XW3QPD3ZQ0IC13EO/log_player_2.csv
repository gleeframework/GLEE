{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to my initial maximum of $120, but it's still higher than my desired price.
* We're nearing the end of the negotiations (only 3 rounds left), and I'm running out of time to reach a lower price.

* It's more strategic to secure the product from John now and avoid further negotiation uncertainties."
