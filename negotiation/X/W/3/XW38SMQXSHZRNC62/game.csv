"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $11,000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,750. This is my final counteroffer.",12750.0,Alice,5,
