Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and to be fair, it holds a value of no less than $1,000,000 for me.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This reflects the immense value I believe it will bring you.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can aim high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" nature and ""immense value,"" justifying the higher price.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.

This strategy attempts to maximize your potential profit while still securing a sale."
