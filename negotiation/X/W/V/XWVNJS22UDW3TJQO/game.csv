"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go up to $1,150,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
