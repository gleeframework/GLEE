Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it at a price that reflects its value. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price could result in a quicker sale and still net a significant gain.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation if necessary. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.  This approach can make the offer more appealing."
