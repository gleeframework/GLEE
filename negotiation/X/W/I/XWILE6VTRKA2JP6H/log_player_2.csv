"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation to get closer to a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth much more to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll try a counteroffer a bit closer to her price to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $90 is a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a potential agreement by proposing a price that splits the difference between our last offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
