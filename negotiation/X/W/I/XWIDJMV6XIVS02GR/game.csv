"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking $95 for it.  It's worth a lot more than that to you, so I think it's a fair price. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to the product's value as possible. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $90. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth. Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $87.50. That's the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $89? That's a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's close this deal!",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $89 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $88.50. That's the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",88.5,Bob,6,
