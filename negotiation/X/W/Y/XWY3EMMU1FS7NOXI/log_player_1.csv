""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit margin. It's a price point likely to be attractive to Bob while exceeding your minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
