Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Create Urgency:**  Offering a price slightly below her minimum and highlighting ""significant value"" might incentivize Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing closer to $15,000.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept. If he's price-sensitive and knows his maximum value is $12,000, he might reject even a tempting offer."
