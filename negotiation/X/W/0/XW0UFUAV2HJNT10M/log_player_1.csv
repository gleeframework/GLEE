Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it offers significant value, but let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, you can gauge his level of interest and adjust accordingly. 
* **Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, ensuring you won't be left with the product if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
