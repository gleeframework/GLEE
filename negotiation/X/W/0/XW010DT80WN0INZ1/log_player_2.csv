"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $5,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still allows me some room to make a profit while ensuring we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $8,500. This is a good compromise that lets us both get a win. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
