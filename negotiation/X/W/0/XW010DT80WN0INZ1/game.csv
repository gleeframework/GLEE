"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $5,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still allows me some room to make a profit while ensuring we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $8,500. This is a good compromise that lets us both get a win. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
