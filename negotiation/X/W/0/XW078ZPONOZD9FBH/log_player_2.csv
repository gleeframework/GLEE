# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

It's a good deal, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much as possible."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value and market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice has come down from her initial price significantly, and $850,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's a compromise that saves him a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
