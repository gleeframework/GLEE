"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and market demand.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming to secure the product for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  This would still allow you to make a healthy profit while giving me a better deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value and market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",850000.0,Alice,3,
