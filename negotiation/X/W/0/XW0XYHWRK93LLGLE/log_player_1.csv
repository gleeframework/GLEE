Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $175. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with $175 offers a potential $25 profit margin over your minimum acceptable price. This markup is within a reasonable range for negotiation.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but emphasizes the value of the product to entice Bob while firmly setting a higher initial price."
