"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.
