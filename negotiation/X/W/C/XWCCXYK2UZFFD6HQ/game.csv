"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you'd like to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it leaves some room for a reasonable profit for you.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,250, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a bit more for this product. How about we go up to $11,500, but I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal?",11500.0,Alice,5,
