"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a game-changer for your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. Let's talk!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go lower than $1,100,000.  This is a significant investment for you, but one that will deliver substantial returns.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,100,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be more comfortable with the price. Can we discuss $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product.  Let's aim for a figure that's closer to the middle ground.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This reflects the potential benefits you'll gain from this investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be comfortable with the price. Can we discuss $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $980,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a figure that's more balanced. I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  This deal will be mutually beneficial, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is a compromise that I'm comfortable with. Can we make it work?",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, $990,000 still falls short of a fair price that reflects the real value of this product to your business.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,005,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I truly believe this deal will be a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal and make this a successful partnership.",1005000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I've made a serious offer of $990,000. I'm not willing to go any higher. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. I'm willing to walk away from this deal.",990000.0,Bob,10,
