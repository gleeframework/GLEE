Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Clear Value Statement:** While you don't want to reveal your minimum, emphasizing the product's worth to Bob justifies the high price.
* **Firmness:**  The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach can sometimes lead to quicker decisions and potentially deter extensive haggling. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower the initial offer. However, starting too low could leave money on the table.
* **Market context:** If similar products are selling for significantly less than $20,000, you might need to adjust your expectations and starting price."
