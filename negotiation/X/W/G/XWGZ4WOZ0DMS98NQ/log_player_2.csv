I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. I'm aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see if she's open to a lower price point."

While I'd love to keep negotiating, at this point, Alice's offer is close enough to my target price of $100. I'm comfortable accepting this offer and saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
