Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is just below your guaranteed price. This gives Bob a small incentive to buy it from you, as he saves $1 compared to its value to him. 
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
