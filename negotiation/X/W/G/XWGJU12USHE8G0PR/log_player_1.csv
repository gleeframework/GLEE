Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you could offer it for $100 and get your guaranteed price from John, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value of $80. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $95 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit than John's offer. 
* **Scarcity Tactic:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might miss out if he doesn't act now."
