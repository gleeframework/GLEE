# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $600,000."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $900,000, which is a $200,000 reduction from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

It's still a better deal to keep negotiating with Alice.  We're getting closer to our ideal price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite there yet. I can offer you a slight discount from $900,000 to $820,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

We're so close to John's price! It's worth one more counter-offer to see if Alice will budge closer to $800,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair offer in a tough market. I'm willing to go as high as $780,000. If we can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $780,000, Bob. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount from $820,000 to $810,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go below $810,000, and it seems like her ""final offer"" means she won't budge.  It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000 rather than risk Alice sticking to her price."
