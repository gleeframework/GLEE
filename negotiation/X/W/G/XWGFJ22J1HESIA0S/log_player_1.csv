Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial offer, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still thinking $80 is a good price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle from your last offer. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $92.50, which is closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, I'm happy to accept this offer.  It's still a good profit for me, and it avoids the risk of losing a sale and having to deal with John."
