"Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset with great potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I can still get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to a reasonable price. To be honest, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 still falls short of my expectations.  Let's aim for a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows you a considerable margin for your investment. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $1,025,000?  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $1,025,000 is tempting, I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,062,500? This gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?",1062500.0,Alice,7,
