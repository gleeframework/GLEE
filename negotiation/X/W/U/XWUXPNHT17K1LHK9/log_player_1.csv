Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice is guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so she won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd theoretically pay up to that amount.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit but needs to offer a price attractive enough for Bob to accept instead of going with his alternative (which is to not buy).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Targeting the High End:**  Alice starts by aiming slightly below Bob's maximum valuation but significantly above her own minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other interested parties"" add a touch of pressure for Bob to decide quickly. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While the offer is strong, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's extremely price-sensitive. Alice can then decide if a slightly lower price is acceptable.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or alternative options. In a real-world scenario, additional information could influence the offer."
