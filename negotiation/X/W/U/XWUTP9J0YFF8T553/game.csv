"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still above what I can afford right now.  I'm prepared to offer you $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering your need to sell and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
