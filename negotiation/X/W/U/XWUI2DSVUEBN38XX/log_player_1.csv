"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold opening that leaves room for negotiation. It also helps establish a sense of the product's value in Bob's mind. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to maximize my potential earnings, so starting high is a good strategy.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential budget.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I have room to lower the price if necessary without feeling like I'm losing too much.
* **Plan B:** Remember, John is a backup option willing to pay $1,000,000. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always switch to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Bob has shown a willingness to pay a significant amount. I want to see if I can push him higher.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to hold out for a better deal.
* **Learning Bob's Limits:** By seeing how much Bob is willing to offer, I can better estimate his maximum budget.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's current offer.  This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while still pushing for a favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer to Bob is $1,400,000. I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,500,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  It's still a price that is higher than Bob's offer, signaling that I haven't completely conceded.
* **Learning Bob's Limits:** This allows me to assess Bob's willingness to pay and see if he's closer to my target price.

**Next Steps:**

I'm ready to see how Bob responds to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll have to consider lowering my price further or potentially moving on to John. However, I'm still hopeful that I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob within the remaining rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping for a higher figure.  We've been stuck at this price for two rounds, and I believe I can still push for a slightly better deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Improvement:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but he's hesitant to budge above $1,200,000. I'm hoping I can convince him to go slightly higher. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer again shows that I'm not desperate to sell at this price.
* **Assessing Bob's Limits:** By seeing how firm he is at $1,200,000, I can better understand his maximum budget. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than Bob's offer. I'm aware that time is running out, but I'm not willing to sell for $1,000,000 to John unless it's absolutely necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

This round is crucial as we are already halfway through the negotiation process. I am offering $1,300,000, a slight increase from Bob's last offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer represents a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing a genuine willingness to find common ground.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to push for a deal while acknowledging the time constraints. 
* **Assessing Bob's Flexibility:** I want to see if Bob is willing to budge even slightly from his last offer. If he rejects this counteroffer, I will have to seriously consider accepting his last offer or moving to John.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to make a decisive decision in the next round. I might accept his last offer or move on to John.  However, I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the value of the product and agrees to this compromise."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing.
* **Slight Improvement:** While not ideal, the offer is slightly higher than Bob's previous offer and is a decent amount of money.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but it's a lower amount. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a higher profit.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal.  This is the best outcome given the limited rounds and the potential of not reaching a higher price with Bob."
