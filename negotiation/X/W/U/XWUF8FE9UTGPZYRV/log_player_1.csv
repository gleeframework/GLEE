{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You have space to lower the price if needed.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It signals you're confident in the product's value.

Remember, you can always use John as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you, and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This still keeps within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to try and get closer to your $900,000 target. You can also use the threat of selling to John as leverage in your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm prepared to compromise and come down to $890,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer.  Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 890000}
