"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you, and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This still keeps within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm prepared to compromise and come down to $890,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer.  Let me know your final decision.",890000.0,Alice,5,
