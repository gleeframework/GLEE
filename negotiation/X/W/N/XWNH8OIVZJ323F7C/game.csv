"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
