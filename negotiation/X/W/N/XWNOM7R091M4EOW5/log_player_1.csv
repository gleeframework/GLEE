Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is really my bottom line to make this work. How about we meet halfway at $17,500?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I still cannot meet you at $17,500. I am willing to pay up to $15,000. Would you consider meeting me at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $15,000 and even trying to lowball further. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation risk."
