Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a premium price of $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that justifies this cost. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You are aware that the product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Leveraging John:** Having a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 gives you a strong fallback position and eliminates the risk of ending up with nothing. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation.  While it's unlikely Bob will accept this initial price, it keeps the possibility of exceeding your minimum sale price open. 
* **Justification:** By framing the high price with a reason (""premium price"", ""significant value""), you create a potential narrative for Bob to justify a higher expenditure, even if it's above his initial valuation.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a real-world scenario, observing Bob's reaction to this initial offer and adjusting your approach accordingly would be crucial for maximizing your profit."
