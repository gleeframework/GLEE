"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and what I'm able to offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the product's value to you and is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,450,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's finalize this now.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little hesitant at $1,550,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,525,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize this deal.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
