"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, you can potentially do better. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is a good price. While it's still higher than my initial counteroffer, it's getting closer to my desired price range and is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  We're already in round 3, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal by continuing to negotiate.  Buying from John would cost me a lot more, making this a better option."
