"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $8,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? This is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying this product, let's close the deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go back to $8,750? I really think that's a fair price for the product.",8750.0,Bob,6,
