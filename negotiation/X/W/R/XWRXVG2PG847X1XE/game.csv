"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, considering its value and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to accept $800000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,4,
