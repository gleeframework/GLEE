"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,200,001. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, $1,200,001 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for it, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What are your thoughts?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,160,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this.",1160000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,160,000. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a counteroffer of $1,165,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1165000.0,Alice,5,
