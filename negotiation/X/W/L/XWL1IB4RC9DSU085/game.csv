"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you significant value.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1100000 is more than I'm comfortable paying.  Considering my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $850000.  This is a fair price that reflects the market value and allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit outside of my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $900000.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the market value. It's also closer to my limit, making it a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Alice,5,
