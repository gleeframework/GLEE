"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** Buying from Alice for $120 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice, you're getting it for $120, which is still within your $150 budget and leaves you with some room for profit if you choose to resell."
