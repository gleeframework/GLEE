"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which is valued at $15,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $14,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a product that could significantly enhance your experience or business. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a full $1,000 more than your fallback option (buying from John). By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay such a high price. Alice might come back with a lower offer closer to her own valuation of $12,000."
