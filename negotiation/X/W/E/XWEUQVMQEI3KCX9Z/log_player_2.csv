"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $950,000. It's a significant value proposition for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential worth to your business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, it's still a substantial markup from Alice's own valuation. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so you can try to push for a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  If negotiations with Alice don't go well, you have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This is still a good profit for you and allows me to make this a worthwhile purchase. Let's see if we can work out a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a substantial discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to make a strong profit. This is my final offer for this round. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.** It's closer to my maximum budget, but I can still try to negotiate lower. 
* **I have rounds to spare.**  There are 7 rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate and hopefully get a better price.
* **John's offer is my fallback.** If Alice refuses to budge further, I can still buy the product from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $887,500. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. I'm confident that this deal will be mutually beneficial in the long run. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget.**  It's still above my ideal price, but it's significantly lower than John's offer.
* **We're nearing the midpoint.**  The price is closer to my target than Alice's target, and we've made good progress in negotiations. 
* **Time is a factor.**  We're already halfway through the rounds, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing a good deal.

While I would prefer a lower price, accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable cost, and I still have a decent profit margin."
