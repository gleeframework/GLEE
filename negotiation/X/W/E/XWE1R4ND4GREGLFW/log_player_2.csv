"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $145. I believe it represents a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $145 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
