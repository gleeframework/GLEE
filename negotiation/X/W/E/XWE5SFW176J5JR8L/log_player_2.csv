"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I have to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I know this product has. I'm counteroffering at $9,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating towards his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $9,100. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target.  Bob should continue negotiating, as he has a few rounds left to get closer to his ideal price. If he rejects, he can make another counteroffer and potentially get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $9,100 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,900. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $9,050. This is getting close to my minimum, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a limited number of rounds left. Alice's counteroffer of $9,050 is getting very close to Bob's target price and closer to his own minimum. If Bob rejects the offer, he risks losing a good deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
