Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that low yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so I'm offering $1,012,500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and $1,012,500 is a strong offer. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above my minimum.  It's always possible to hold out for more, but there's also the risk of Bob lowering his offer in future rounds."
