"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify a price that high.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $750,000 is closer to a fair deal, it's still less than I'm hoping to get. To be done with the negotiations, how about we split the difference and call it $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to move a bit more. How about $775,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're really close.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's close this deal - $810,000, and we have an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,7,
