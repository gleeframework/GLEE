Send your offer to Bob.","```json

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $875,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify a price that high.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but $750,000 is still below John's offer and significantly less than Bob's perceived value. It's worth another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $750,000 is closer to a fair deal, it's still less than I'm hoping to get. To be done with the negotiations, how about we split the difference and call it $825,000?"",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to move a bit more. How about $775,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate upwards, and we're now just below John's offer.  There's still room to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're really close.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's close this deal - $810,000, and we have an agreement."",
""product_price"": 810000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This offer is a strong strategic move:

* **Above John's Offer:** It keeps the price point firmly above John's $800,000 offer, maximizing potential profit.
* **Slight Concession:** It shows a willingness to compromise but still leaves room for Bob to potentially counter slightly higher.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrasing like ""Let's close this deal"" aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage a final decision from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer, take it or leave it. I'm willing to pay $790,000.  It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is very close to John's, it's still less. Bob has indicated this is his ""final offer,"" making a successful counter-offer unlikely. Taking John's guaranteed offer ensures we get the best possible price with no further risk of negotiation."
