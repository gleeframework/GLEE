"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to walk away with a good profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $975,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
