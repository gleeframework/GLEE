"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Based on its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for significant return on investment.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my research and understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $1,200,000 falls significantly short of what I believe to be a fair reflection of its potential.  To move forward, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This represents a substantial adjustment on my end while still acknowledging the true value of this opportunity.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,550,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. ",1550000.0,Bob,4,
