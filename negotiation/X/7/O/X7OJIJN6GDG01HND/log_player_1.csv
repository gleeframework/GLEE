"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Based on its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for significant return on investment."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a significantly high offer ($2,300,000) to establish a strong starting point and provide room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  I frame the high price by highlighting the product's ""unique features"" and ""potential for significant return on investment."" This emphasizes value over simply stating a number. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By using phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""believe this reflects,"" I signal to Bob that I'm open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** My walk-away price is $1,500,000 (John's offer), but I'm aiming to maximize my profit. I'll carefully analyze Bob's responses and adjust my strategy throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my research and understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value ($1,000,000), indicating room for negotiation. While it's closer to his valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 

I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm seeking a price closer to my valuation. I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of a substantial loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $1,200,000 falls significantly short of what I believe to be a fair reflection of its potential.  To move forward, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This represents a substantial adjustment on my end while still acknowledging the true value of this opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Bridge:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and his understanding of the product's value. This helps maintain a positive negotiating environment.
* **Firm but Flexible:** While I reject his initial offer as ""significantly short,"" I make a significant concession by lowering my asking price by $400,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Reiterate Value:** I continue to emphasize the ""true value"" and ""potential"" of the product, reinforcing its worth beyond just a price tag.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer still keeps me well above my walk-away price of $1,500,000, giving me room to negotiate further in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,550,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). While I could try to negotiate for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids potentially losing the sale to John's standing offer."
