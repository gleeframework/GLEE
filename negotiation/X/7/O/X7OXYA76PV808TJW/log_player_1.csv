{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives me a good idea of Bob's interest level by his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $100 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a fair price for this exceptional product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and is close to my last counteroffer. It's in my best interest to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of ending up with a lower price or even selling to John for $80."
