Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's too early to accept Bob's offer. It's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is too low for me. I'm prepared to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above my limit. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll offer $800,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
