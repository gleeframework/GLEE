{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,800,000 that Alice is asking for. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,400,000 undervalues it.  Would you consider $1,650,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer is still a bit too high for me. I think I can negotiate further to get a better price. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to drive the price down a bit more. Here's my next counteroffer:
