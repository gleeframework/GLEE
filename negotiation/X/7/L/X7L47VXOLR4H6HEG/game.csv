"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset to you. It's worth $8,000 to you, but I'm offering it to you for a special price of $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I would get from another buyer. What do you think? ",12000.0,Alice,1,
