"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. You can save more money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value. It demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate.  The offer leaves room for potential negotiation and a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer, but still less appealing than buying from John. By rejecting, we can continue to negotiate and try to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, but her offers are still on the higher side.  By counteroffering at $825,000, we're moving closer to a potential deal. This offer is still within the range of what we're willing to pay, and might be enough to tempt Alice to close the deal.  If she rejects, we can continue to negotiate in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what we're willing to pay.  We have already moved closer to a potential deal, but we can still drive the price down further.  By rejecting, we can continue to negotiate and try to secure a better price.  We are not yet close to the point where buying from John becomes a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to our desired range, but we can still push for a slightly better price.  This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, and if Alice rejects it, we might be forced to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We have reached a point where the negotiation with Alice seems to be stuck. Alice is unwilling to budge much on her price. Buying from John, while more expensive, provides a guaranteed deal with a known price.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation with Alice is not worth the potential for savings."
