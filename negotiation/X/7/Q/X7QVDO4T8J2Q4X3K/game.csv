"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250? This price would be fair for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",10000.0,Alice,5,
