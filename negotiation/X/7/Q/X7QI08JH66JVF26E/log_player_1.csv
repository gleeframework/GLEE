Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and while I have other interested parties, I believe you're the ideal fit. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob at a slightly lower price could still be more profitable than waiting.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets a $50,000 discount from his perceived value, and you earn a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message implies strong demand while acknowledging Bob's position, encouraging him to accept the offer without prolonged negotiation."
