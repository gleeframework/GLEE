"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm not willing to settle for the minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I believe the true value of this product justifies a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,275,000? This allows us both to benefit from the transaction."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still feel that we could come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $1,250,000? It would be a win-win situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has moved closer to my price point, and $1,250,000 is a significant profit.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing him away. It's time to accept and close the deal."
