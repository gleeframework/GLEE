# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll offer it to you for $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our perspectives and allows me to recoup some of the value I've invested in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly stated she won't go lower than $10,000. While this is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $8,000. I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's likely we'll be stuck in a stalemate. To avoid further time waste and secure the product within my budget, I'll choose to buy it from John."
