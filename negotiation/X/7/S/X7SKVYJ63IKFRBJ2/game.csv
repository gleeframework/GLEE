"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident this product can be very valuable to your business. Let me know what you think!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1500000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1350000?  This would still be a very good deal for you, and would allow me to continue to get a fair return for my product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $1350000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1275000. This would be a fair compromise, and would allow both of us to walk away happy.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1275000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, to $1325000. This is a good compromise, and ensures we both get a fair price.  Let's close this deal!",1325000.0,Alice,5,
