Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I'm not going to sell it for less than that.
* **Potential Gain:** By offering $1,500,000, I have the potential to make an extra $500,000 if Bob accepts.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob will reject the offer, I'm willing to take that chance for the potential gain. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell the product to John for $1,000,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my offer to Bob."
