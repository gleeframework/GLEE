"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a substantial discount considering its true value.  This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested in taking advantage of this opportunity.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
