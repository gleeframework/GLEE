"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find great value in it. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  While I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is far below the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1700000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1400000 for your product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm seeking. Let's meet in the middle to close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $1400000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1550000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
