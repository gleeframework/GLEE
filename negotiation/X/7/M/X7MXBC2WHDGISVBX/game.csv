"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, I'm aiming for a lower price point to fit my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which is still a significant amount considering its rarity. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
