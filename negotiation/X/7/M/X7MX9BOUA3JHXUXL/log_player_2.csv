"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that holds significant value for your business, potentially worth $1,200,000 to you. I understand its worth to you and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. Consider it carefully, as this is a limited-time opportunity. If you choose not to proceed, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
