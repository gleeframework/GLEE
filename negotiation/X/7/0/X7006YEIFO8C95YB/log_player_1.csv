{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's a common tactic in negotiation to start with a higher price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the value of the product can make Bob more likely to consider your offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $800,000 gives you a solid baseline. If Bob doesn't meet your price, you can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider $750000? I believe this is a fair price, given my budget and the value of the product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for less than what I know the product is worth.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident in the value of this product.  It's truly special, and I believe it can deliver significant returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not ending the negotiation.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that is halfway between my minimum and his offer.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to keep him interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $800000. This is a significant price reduction from your initial offer, and I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to me. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
