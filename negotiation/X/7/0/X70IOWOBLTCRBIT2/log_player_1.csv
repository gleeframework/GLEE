I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer of $80 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
