Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and more open to negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning ""great deal"" and ""fantastic product"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth without revealing my absolute minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to figure out if his counteroffer is acceptable or if I should make a counter-counter offer. I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob becomes too tedious or unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident the product is worth more than $100.  There's still potential to negotiate with Bob and get a better price.
* **John as a fallback:**  While $120 from John is acceptable, I prefer to try and get more from Bob if possible.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my minimum. For example, I could offer $130. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'll continue to emphasize the product's worth and try to understand why Bob is so insistent on a low price. 
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  If Bob continues to be unreasonable, I'll be ready to accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I can't go below $130.  This still represents a great value for you considering the product's quality.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I've moved down from my initial $150 offer to $130, showing flexibility. This is still above my minimum but demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain value focus:**  I'm reiterating the product's quality to justify the price. 
* **Open to compromise:**  I've used language like ""find a compromise"" to encourage further discussion. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:**  If Bob rejects my offer again, I'll need to carefully consider my options.
* **Adjust my strategy:**  I'll be prepared to either lower my price further or stick to my $130 offer and see if Bob changes his mind. 
* **Be ready to sell to John:**  If negotiation becomes unproductive, I'll be prepared to accept John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $120. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* **No further negotiation:**  There's no room for further negotiation without losing money. 
* **Avoiding uncertainty:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection.

**Next Steps:**

Since I've accepted Bob's offer, the negotiation is complete. I'll proceed with the sale and finalize the transaction with Bob."
