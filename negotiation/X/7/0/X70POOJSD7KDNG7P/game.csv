"Bob, I appreciate you taking interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I can't go below $130.  This still represents a great value for you considering the product's quality.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,
