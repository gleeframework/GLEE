Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, his counteroffers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap quickly enough to warrant risking the sure $800,000 from John."
