"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  While $725,000 is still below what I'd consider, I'm seeing if we can find a solution. Would you be willing to meet at $812,500? This keeps us moving but acknowledges the value of the product.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, $812,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about we try $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,6,
