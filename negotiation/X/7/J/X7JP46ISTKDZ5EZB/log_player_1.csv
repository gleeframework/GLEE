"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we're still a bit far apart on price.  While I think $130 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $75.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for coming up a bit.  I'm still looking to get closer to $100 for this.  Would you be willing to go to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $80? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to get this great product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $150.  It's better to cut your losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
