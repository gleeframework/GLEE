"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its potential value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While $17,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we settle at $15,500? This would be a final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that this is your final offer, but I can't quite meet that price. If you're willing to come down to $13,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Let me know.",13000.0,Bob,6,
