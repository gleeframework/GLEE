Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its potential value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? "", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While $17,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $12,500?

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that this is your final offer, but I can't quite meet that price. If you're willing to come down to $13,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, he's consistently well below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach $15,000.  John offers a guaranteed $15,000, eliminating further negotiation and potential loss. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale."
