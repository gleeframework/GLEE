"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
Starting high is a common negotiation tactic.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll aim for a high price and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I can always lower the price in the next round.  I'll also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is my bottom line, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my bottom line, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal. I'll accept his offer, as it's better than selling to John for $80."
