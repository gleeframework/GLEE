"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. $12000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit far from my desired price. Would you be willing to consider $13500? It's a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
