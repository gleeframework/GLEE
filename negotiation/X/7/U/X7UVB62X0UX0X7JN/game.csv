"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1800000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1500000 is your maximum budget, but I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  I'm prepared to offer $1600000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think $1600000 is a bit low for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go slightly lower than that. I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1650000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1550000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $1625000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle.
