"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product's unique features and potential for your business are worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a very fair price considering the value you'll gain. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
