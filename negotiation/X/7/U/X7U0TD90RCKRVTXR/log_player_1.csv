Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value. I'm confident you'll find it beneficial to your operations. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000). This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, which can appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the benefits the product can bring to Bob's operations, potentially increasing his willingness to pay.
* **Open-Ended:** I'm ending the message with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, I see a chance to earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob. The risk is that we might not reach an agreement, but the potential reward is a higher selling price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product's unique features and potential for your business are worth more than that.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm firmly stating my minimum price but framing it as a ""fair"" price. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining my bottom line.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and its potential benefit to Bob's business. This reinforces the idea that the price reflects the product's worth.
* **Seeking a Solution:** I'm ending the message with a call to action, emphasizing a desire to find a solution that benefits both parties. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate further."
