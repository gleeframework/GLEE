Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $6,000 is quite low, but I understand you have a budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While I believe this product would be valuable for me, $13,000 is still too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. How about $11,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a stretch for me.  I can offer you $7,500 for the product. I think that represents a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Explanation: Bob is not budging much on price.  It's unlikely we'll reach a deal that's significantly better than our guaranteed $12,000 from John.  It's time to cut our losses and move on."
