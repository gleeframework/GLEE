"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $6,000 is quite low, but I understand you have a budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While I believe this product would be valuable for me, $13,000 is still too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. How about $11,000? This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a stretch for me.  I can offer you $7,500 for the product. I think that represents a fair compromise. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,6,
