**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Alice is offering the product for $12,000, while John is selling it for $15,000. 
* **You're saving money.** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $3,000 compared to buying from John.

Even though Alice is getting a better deal than her initial value of $8,000, you are still saving money."
