"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",11500.0,Alice,5,
