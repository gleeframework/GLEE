"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. I believe this price is still fair, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it allows me to reach a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,250,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and ensure a successful deal. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but $1,300,000 is my absolute final offer.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
