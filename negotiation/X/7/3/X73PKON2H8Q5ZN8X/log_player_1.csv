Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

The optimal strategy aims to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value incentivizes him while netting you a significant gain.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this product. I know its value to you is considerable, and I believe a price of $1,450,000 is a win-win for both of us. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I'll be moving forward with another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Value-Oriented:** The message is clear and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, making it highly likely he'll accept. 
* **Deadline:** Creating urgency encourages a prompt decision.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (aggressive, passive, etc.), you can adjust your approach accordingly."
