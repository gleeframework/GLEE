"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still beneficial for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but not ideal:** While $9,500 is less than $10,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** You can reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price with her, or you can accept her offer and try to negotiate a lower price with her.  But there is no guarantee that either of these strategies will be successful.
* **Minimizing loss:** Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to stick to your budget and explore other options without losing money. 

You can continue the negotiation with Alice or move on to John, keeping in mind your budget and the fact that you may be able to find a better deal elsewhere."
