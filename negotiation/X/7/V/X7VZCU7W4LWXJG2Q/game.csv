"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $140 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $135? I think that's a fair compromise.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. How about we try $142? I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value and quality.",142.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still sticking to my limit of $135.  Would you be willing to meet me there? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",135.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your limit, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $139? I think that's a fair compromise.",139.0,Alice,7,
