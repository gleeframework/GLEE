Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you make a good profit.
* **It's less than the product's worth to Bob:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and incentivizes him to accept. 

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below our desired price. We can do better by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. We want to maximize our profit without risking losing the sale entirely.  

Let's see if we can negotiate a price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. While it's not our ideal price, it's still significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  We also don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate. 

Let's accept Bob's offer and secure the sale!"
