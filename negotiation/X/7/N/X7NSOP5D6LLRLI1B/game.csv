"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it. It's a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which still reflects the value of the product. I believe this price is fair, and I hope we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering my budget limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9500 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which I believe is a fair compromise. It's a significant reduction from my previous offer and a good value for you.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $10000, which I believe is a fair compromise, reflecting both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
