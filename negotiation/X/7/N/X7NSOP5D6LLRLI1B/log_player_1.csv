{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is too low, and I think I can get more.  I'm going to try and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which still reflects the value of the product. I believe this price is fair, and I hope we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering my budget limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my target, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price.  I think I can still push for something closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. It's a significant reduction from my previous offer and a good value for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $10000, which I believe is a fair compromise, reflecting both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as what John is willing to pay. Since I'm trying to maximize my earnings, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
