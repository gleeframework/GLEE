"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer.  While $9500 is still a bit lower than I'd like,  I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and we're almost there. How about we meet in the middle at $9750? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
