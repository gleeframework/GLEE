You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below both our minimum and the product's actual value to him. We're not desperate yet, and we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can push him higher in the next round."

Round 5

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers, but we're still significantly below our minimum. We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and it's time to apply more pressure. We'll hold firm for now and see if he's willing to make a more substantial jump."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to close this deal, but the price needs to reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept $1,050,000.  This is a very fair offer, and I won't go any lower."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're entering the later stages of the negotiation and need to signal we're getting close to our limit.  By dropping our price slightly, but firmly stating it's our final offer, we hope to incentivize Bob to counter with a significant jump closer to our desired outcome."
