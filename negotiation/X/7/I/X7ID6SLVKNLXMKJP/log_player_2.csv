"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm confident that you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. $850,000 is above your budget, and you can likely get a better deal with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $825,000 is getting closer to your budget, you still have some room to negotiate. There's no harm in trying to get a better price, especially since you have 7 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
