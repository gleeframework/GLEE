Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  This is a time-sensitive offer as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High but Negotiable:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. This allows her to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
