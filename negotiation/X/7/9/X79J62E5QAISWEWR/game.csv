"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still allows you to profit.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd like to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part and allows you to make a reasonable profit.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
