Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,250. It's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and she's consistently been unwilling to go below $13,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get her below $13,000, and I have a guaranteed option with John for $10,000. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
