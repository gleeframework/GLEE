"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm willing to budge a little bit.  How about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,250. It's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
