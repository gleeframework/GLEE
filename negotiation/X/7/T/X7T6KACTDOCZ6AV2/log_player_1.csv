I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,250.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
