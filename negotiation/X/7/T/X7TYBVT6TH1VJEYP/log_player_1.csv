Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

This offer starts high, knowing it's unlikely to be accepted immediately.  Here's why:

* **Starting High:** It sets a high bar for the negotiation, giving you more room to come down in price.
* **Leaving Room:** Even at $1,800,000, you're still above your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Appealing to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 

This approach sets the stage for a negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level while still protecting your minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of your product, I believe we can find a price closer to its true value. How about $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, but there's still room for improvement. By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Signal your willingness to negotiate:** It shows Bob you're serious about getting a good price.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** It keeps the pressure on Bob to find a compromise.
* **Potentially get closer to your desired price:** In the next round, you can counter with a price closer to your original offer, or even settle somewhere in between.

Selling to John immediately would secure a profit, but it risks missing out on a potentially higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,650,000. It's still a fair price considering the unique value of this product, and it gives you a significant savings compared to my initial offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer demonstrates a willingness to meet Bob halfway by lowering the price from your initial $1,800,000.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message again emphasizes the product's unique value to make the price more appealing.
* **Significant Savings:** Framing the price as a ""significant savings"" compared to the initial offer makes it more attractive to Bob.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a price that's above your minimum, maximizing your chances of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. Considering the value of the product and my budget, how about $1600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is very close to your previous offer of $1,650,000.  Accepting his offer makes sense for the following reasons:

* **Small Difference:** The difference between his offer and your last counteroffer is only $50,000.  This is a relatively small amount compared to the overall price of the product.
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, where neither of you are willing to budge further.  This could result in a longer negotiation process and potentially a lower final price.
* **Securing the Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's well above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

While you could potentially negotiate further and try to get a higher price, the risk of a stalemate and the opportunity cost of delaying the sale outweigh the potential benefits of a slightly higher price."
