"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also leaves space for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, as there's still room for me to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,000 is still below my minimum price, but it's getting closer.  I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9,250? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,100 is still below my minimum, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I don't risk losing out to John's higher offer, and it's still a decent profit."
