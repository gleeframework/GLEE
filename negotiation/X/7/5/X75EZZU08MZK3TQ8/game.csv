"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal you're providing. However, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I'd like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
