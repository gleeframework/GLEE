Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $10,000 to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. It's also higher than my minimum acceptable price, giving me some room to lower the price if needed. 

This approach allows for a negotiation that has a high chance of success while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal you're providing. However, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I'd like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is still a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer of $14,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle. How about $13,200 for the product? I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, $13,200 is a good compromise and still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful transaction and avoids risking losing the sale altogether."
