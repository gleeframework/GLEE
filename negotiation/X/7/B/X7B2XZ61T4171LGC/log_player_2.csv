# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $120. This means there's room for negotiation. You should try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me. However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to buy it for $130.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
