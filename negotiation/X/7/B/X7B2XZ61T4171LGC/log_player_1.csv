Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for a counteroffer that could benefit both of you.
* **It shows you're serious:**  Offering a specific price demonstrates you're interested in a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me. However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to buy it for $130.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum of $120 and is within the range of potential negotiation. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal."
