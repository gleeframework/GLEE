Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I can see the value of the product is worth more to you than that. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground.  To be transparent, I'm very close to pursuing another option at a lower price point.  If you're able to come down to $950,000, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 950000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to exploring other options, and I don't want to lose the deal. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
