{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is far above his budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay the maximum he's comfortable with - $800,000. This is a significant price reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to Bob. It's a starting point for negotiation, and Bob is hoping that Alice will see the value in accepting this offer, considering it's still above her own ""cost"" of $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob is determined to save as much money as possible.  He's willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer slightly from $800,000 to $850,000. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's offer.  He's hoping this will be enough to entice Alice to accept, as it's a good deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The negotiation has gone back and forth, but Alice's latest offer of $950,000 is still too high for Bob. At this point, Bob has reached his limit. He's willing to pay $800,000 for the product, and anything more is pushing his budget.  Since he has a guaranteed option with John, he chooses to buy the product from John at $800,000. While it might be tempting to continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will come down further, and Bob is comfortable with John's offer."
