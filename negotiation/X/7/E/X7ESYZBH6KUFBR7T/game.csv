"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8,250. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and your offer of $7,800.  However, I'm not willing to go much lower than my previous offer. Let's split the difference and settle at $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would save us both the time and energy of further negotiation. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
