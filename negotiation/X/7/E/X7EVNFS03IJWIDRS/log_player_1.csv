Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal due to its unique features and benefits.  I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price. By starting at $15,000, she aims to capture some of the value Bob places on the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $15,000 offer isn't ridiculously high, leaving space for Bob to potentially negotiate down. Even if Bob negotiates, Alice is in a strong position with her fallback option of John.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message focuses on value and encourages a response from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. Alice could adjust her price and message based on her assessment of Bob's negotiation style and her own risk tolerance."
