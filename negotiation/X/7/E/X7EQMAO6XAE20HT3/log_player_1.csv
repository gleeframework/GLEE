Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product you're selling, but I'm only able to offer $15000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate. I believe the product has a higher value and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more than $15,000.  How about $17,500? This still leaves room for negotiation but is closer to the value I'm hoping to achieve.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 17500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and his offer is closer to my desired price point. However, I'm still not convinced he can't go higher. I'm willing to take one more round to see if I can push him to $17,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $17,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16,750? It's a fair price that reflects both our perspectives. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 16750}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $16,500, which is only $250 less than my last offer. I've already taken five rounds and we're getting closer to a deal. Accepting his offer seems like the best move at this point.  It's a good price and I don't want to risk him backing out completely or me running out of rounds before we reach a deal."
