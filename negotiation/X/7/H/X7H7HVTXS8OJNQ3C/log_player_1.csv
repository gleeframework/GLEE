{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering a price of $120. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still ensuring I get a decent profit. It's likely Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than $100 but less than my original asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.  I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John."
