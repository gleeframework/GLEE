"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I can offer it to you for $14,500. It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're really close now, Bob! I can see you're making a genuine effort to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that.
