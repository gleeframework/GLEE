Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $95 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and inviting, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** This price gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! You've made a successful sale.
* **If Bob rejects:**  Wait for Bob's counteroffer and assess your options:
    * **Counter with a lower price:**  If Bob's counteroffer is reasonable, consider lowering your price to secure the sale.
    * **Hold firm or make a counter-counteroffer:**  If Bob's counteroffer is too low, you can either hold firm at $95 or counter with a slightly lower price, depending on how motivated you are to sell to Bob.
    * **Sell to John:** If the negotiation stalls or you're not comfortable with Bob's counteroffers, you can always opt to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $80 is below your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, so Bob might be willing to go slightly higher in a counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:**  You have a guaranteed sale with John for $100, so you can afford to be a bit more patient and see if you can get closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider offering a price slightly lower than your initial offer ($95) but still above Bob's offer of $80. This shows flexibility while still holding your ground. 
* **Monitor the negotiation:**  Keep track of the offers and counteroffers to see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price or if it's time to sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is a little too low for me. How about $85?  That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between your initial offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($80). It shows you're willing to be flexible.
* **Positive Language:** The message uses positive language (""fair compromise"") to encourage Bob to see this as a good option.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still above your minimum acceptable price of $100, giving you some room to potentially go lower if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:**  Assess whether Bob accepts this offer or makes another counteroffer. 
* **Be prepared to negotiate further:** You may need to adjust your price again, but keep in mind your minimum acceptable price and the option to sell to John for $100."
