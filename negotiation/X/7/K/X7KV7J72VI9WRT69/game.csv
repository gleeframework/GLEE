,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,100,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's try $1,025,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure this deal works for me as well.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
