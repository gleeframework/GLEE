"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's in my best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my firm stance on the price point and hopefully encourages Alice to compromise. My target price is $1,200,000, but I'm willing to test the waters with a lower initial offer to see her reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000, though it is closer. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. I will focus on getting the price closer to $1,200,000 so that I can choose to accept or reject in the coming rounds depending on the value of the product to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,250,000.  This is a significant step closer to my target price of $1,200,000 and shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating. I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Alice to consider, especially since she rejected my previous low offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can push her even lower. There's a possibility she might get more desperate to sell the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $1,300,000.  This is a smaller increment than before, demonstrating that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway. This offer is still below my maximum budget, but it's a significant enough jump to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate."
