"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us room for negotiation and maximizes my potential earnings.  I'm confident I can secure a good price within the 10 rounds, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is too far below my minimum value of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to give away a significant portion of my profit.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that's mutually agreeable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise and potentially reach a deal. I'm confident that this price is fair, given the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $1,400,000. I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can reach a better deal within the remaining rounds. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,350,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm still confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a serious offer and accept, as we're running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum. We're running out of rounds, and the risk of losing the deal to Bob completely is increasing. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the entire profit and having to sell to John at my minimum."
