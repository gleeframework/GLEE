"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $150 by me. Considering its worth to you, I believe we can come to an agreement. Would you be interested in discussing this further? If so, let's aim for a fair price that reflects both its value to you and my investment. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $140 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she's willing to negotiate lower. If not, you're still in a good position to buy from John."
