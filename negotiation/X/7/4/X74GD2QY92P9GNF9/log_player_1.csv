Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price higher than your minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind you have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between your offer and his, suggesting room for negotiation. 
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of John's offer at $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and features."", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** You're making a significant step down from your initial offer to show flexibility, but not too much to undervalue the product.
* **Setting Boundaries:** By stating it's your ""best offer,"" you're subtly putting pressure on Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's quality and features reinforces its worth and justifies the price.
* **Backup Plan:** You're still above your minimum acceptable price and have John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Minimal Gain by Waiting:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. John's offer guarantees $15,000, but squeezing an extra $1,000 from Bob might not be worth the risk of him walking away.

It's better to take a slightly smaller profit now than risk losing the sale and having to settle for your backup option."
