"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $14,000 is under your $15,000 limit, you can try to get a better price. Alice is likely willing to negotiate further down since her product is only worth $12,000 to her."
