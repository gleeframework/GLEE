Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
