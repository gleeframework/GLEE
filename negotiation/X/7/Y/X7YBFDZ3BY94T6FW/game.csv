"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a bit above the market value, considering I've done some research and seen similar products selling for lower prices.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  I've done extensive research on this product and its potential, and I believe your initial assessment undervalues its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while still being a fair deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. It seems we're getting closer.  To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to accept $1,080,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,030,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the market value and the potential benefits I'll get from owning the product.",1030000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position and respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's make this simple.  I'm willing to accept $1,060,000 â€“  my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. If you're unable to agree, I'll need to explore other options.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,030,000. I'm starting to think that I might be better off exploring other options, but I'm willing to give you one last chance. If you're willing to meet me at $1,030,000, I'll consider it a fair deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1030000.0,Bob,8,
