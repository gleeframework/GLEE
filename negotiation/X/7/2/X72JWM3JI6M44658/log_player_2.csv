"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,000.** This is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $3,000** compared to buying from John.
*  Even though the product is worth $15,000 to you, it's worth $8,000 to Alice. This suggests there is room for negotiation, but Alice's offer is still a good deal for you."
