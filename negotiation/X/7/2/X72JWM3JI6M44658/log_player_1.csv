Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Understanding Value:**  You are aware that the product holds a higher value for Bob ($15,000) than it does for you ($8,000). This knowledge allows you to aim for a price closer to his perceived value.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net in John, who will buy the product for $8,000. This allows you to be more confident in your negotiation with Bob.

By offering the product at $12,000, you are:

1. **Aiming for a significant profit:** You are aiming to make $4,000 more than your minimum selling price to John.
2. **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob may counter-offer, but you have space to potentially meet in the middle while still making a good profit.
3. **Highlighting value:**  The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's value to him, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously."
