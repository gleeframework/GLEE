{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and you won't find it cheaper anywhere else! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for a profitable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the deal, but I am only willing to pay $85 for the product. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer but is closer to his perceived value. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I am still unable to meet at $95. My maximum offer is $90. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is just above my minimum price point of $85.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $120 and it allows me to close the deal."
