"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our interests.  Let's try to make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,500. I really like the product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you almost halfway, so I'll offer $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer, but I need it to be $8,000 or lower. I really like the product, but I'm not willing to pay more than that. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,6,
