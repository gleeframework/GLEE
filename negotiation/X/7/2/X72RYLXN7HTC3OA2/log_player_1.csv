{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on the deal's benefits for Bob. 

I'm confident this offer will spark a negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for such a low price. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target. This way, I can maintain leverage in the negotiation and potentially achieve a better outcome."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our interests.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,500. I really like the product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. Accepting it would mean leaving money on the table. 

I'm confident in my product's value and my negotiation skills. I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement that keeps the deal profitable for me."

This counteroffer is designed to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation positive and constructive."
