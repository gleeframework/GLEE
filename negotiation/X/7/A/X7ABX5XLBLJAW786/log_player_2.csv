"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?"",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation tactics to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While starting low, we don't want to insult Alice with an extremely low offer. $850,000 is a significant jump down from her initial offer, but it shows we're serious while aiming for a good deal.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason, even a simple one like ""meeting in the middle,"" can make your counteroffer seem more palatable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low. The product is worth much more to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This gives you a substantial discount while still allowing me to get a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  She's anchoring her offers around a perceived ""split the difference"" point.  We need to show her we're willing to walk away if the price isn't right, pushing her closer to our ideal range."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind.  Would you consider $925,000? I feel that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** We're increasing our offer to signal to Alice that we're serious about buying, but not at any price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're aiming below the ""split the difference"" point Alice seems focused on.  This keeps the negotiation moving in our favor while leaving room for a final compromise closer to $900,000.
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  We continue to be polite and respectful,  which helps foster a positive negotiation environment and increases the likelihood of a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's compromise at $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you while allowing me to receive a reasonable return.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is persistently sticking to the ""split the difference"" strategy.  While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, $975,000 is already a good deal, significantly below our $1,500,000 fallback option.  

Continuing to negotiate risks alienating Alice or reaching a point where the price difference is negligible. Accepting now secures the product at a very favorable price."
