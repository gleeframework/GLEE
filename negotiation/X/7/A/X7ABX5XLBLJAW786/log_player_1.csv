``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, leaving room for potential concessions if Bob counteroffers.  It's also important to highlight the value to Bob, which might make him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly less than the value of the product to Bob. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low. The product is worth much more to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This gives you a substantial discount while still allowing me to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind.  Would you consider $925,000? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can push for a higher price and still secure a deal with Bob. I'll counteroffer again,  aiming to close the gap further."
