"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low. The product is worth much more to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This gives you a substantial discount while still allowing me to get a fair price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind.  Would you consider $925,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's compromise at $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you while allowing me to receive a reasonable return.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
