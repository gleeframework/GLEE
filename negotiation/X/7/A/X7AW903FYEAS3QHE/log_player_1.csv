"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $115. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $120 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price and it's likely Bob won't go higher. It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing him and potentially having to settle for a lower price with John later."
