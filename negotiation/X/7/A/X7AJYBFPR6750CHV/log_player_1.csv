Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product. I think it would be particularly useful for someone with your needs. I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially gain more.
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number. By mentioning Bob's ""needs,"" I'm trying to subtly anchor the value proposition in his mind, even if the exact value is subjective. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational, signaling I'm open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate how much he values the product and how flexible he might be.
2. **Maximize potential profit:** While I have a backup offer, it's always better to explore if I can get a price closer to my initial ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I want to explore if I can get a slightly better deal. Since he's already showing interest and willingness to negotiate, I'll make a counteroffer that's still above my minimum but shows some flexibility on my end."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Target Price:** The $13,000 price point is a good balance:  it's a $1,000 profit for me over my minimum and a $1,000 discount for Bob from my initial ask. 
* **Clear Justification:** I'm directly addressing his concern about the price being ""steep"" and proposing a solution that benefits both of us. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maintain momentum:** Keep the negotiation moving forward by offering a reasonable compromise.
2. **Secure a profitable deal:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, my goal remains to secure the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we try $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's latest offer of $11,500 is now below my absolute minimum of $12,000. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer further, or the negotiation reaching an impasse.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum price.

While I could try to push Bob a bit further, the potential gain is small compared to the risk of losing both offers. Selling to John is the most rational choice at this point to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
