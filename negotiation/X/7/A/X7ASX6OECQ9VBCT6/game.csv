"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  It's a win-win for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $11,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $12,500 is my final offer - it's a very fair price considering what you're getting.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,6,
