{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500. This is above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Buying from John:**  While John's price is your limit, there's a chance you can negotiate with Alice and get a better deal.
* **Strategy:** Reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to see if you can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in your product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Alice is willing to sell for $8,000.  A counteroffer of $8,500 is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being significantly lower than her initial offer. 
* **Strategy:**  By making a counteroffer that's closer to her minimum acceptable price, we aim to encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, and I understand your budget concerns.  While $8,500 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your stance, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's make this happen.  It's a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price.

* **Positive Tone:**  The message uses a positive tone to encourage Alice to accept the offer and close the deal.
* **Strategy:**  We're trying to find a compromise point that's acceptable to both sides, while still keeping the price below your maximum budget."
