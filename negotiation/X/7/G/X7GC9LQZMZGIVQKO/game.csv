"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While the product seems great, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
