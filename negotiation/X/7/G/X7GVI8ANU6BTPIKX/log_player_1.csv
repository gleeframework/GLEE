Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.
