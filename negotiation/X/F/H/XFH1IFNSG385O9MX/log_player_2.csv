"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise while still aiming for a substantial savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better price. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's still room to negotiate and potentially get the product for less than that.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $11,000? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily decreasing his offer, showing Alice that he is serious about getting a good deal.  He is aiming for a price that is close to Alice's minimum but still within his budget.  This counteroffer continues to demonstrate Bob's willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,250. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has gotten a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is approaching his maximum willingness to pay.  While he could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will get stubborn and refuse further concessions.  $11,250 is a good deal, and accepting the offer minimizes the risk of losing the product entirely."
