Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

I can offer it to you for $1,225,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm willing to go no lower than this price.

This is a good time to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $275,000 less than John's price and $75,000 less than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is clearly trying to get as close to her value of $1,200,000 as possible.  Further haggling might only yield small incremental savings.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing too hard could make Alice walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
