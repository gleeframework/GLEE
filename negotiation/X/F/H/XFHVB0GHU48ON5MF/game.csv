"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $1,225,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm willing to go no lower than this price.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
