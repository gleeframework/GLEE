"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm sure you'll find that a fair price considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I can't go any lower than $135. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, which would be $132.50. Can you consider that?",132.5,Bob,6,
