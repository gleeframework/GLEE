Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests.  I'm willing to make this transaction particularly smooth for you with a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a premium over his perceived value ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a strong opening offer:
    * It's significantly lower than my guaranteed sale price.
    * It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
    * It creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.
* **Positive Framing:** I highlight the product's value to Bob and emphasize a smooth transaction, subtly implying he's getting a good deal."
