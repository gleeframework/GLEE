"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
 ""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price. While it might seem aggressive, it establishes a strong negotiating position.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer helps gauge Alice's flexibility. Her reaction will give us valuable information about how much she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** This leaves ample room to move upwards in subsequent rounds while staying well below our $800,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While that price is a little lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice's counteroffer is a significant decrease, it's still well above our $800,000 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move down suggests there's likely room for further negotiation.
* **John is an Alternative:** We have the safety net of buying from John at $800,000 if we can't reach a satisfactory deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle, somewhere around $800,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 800000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** This offer clearly states our maximum price while maintaining a polite and collaborative tone.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By implying we might buy from John, we create a sense of urgency for Alice to accept this offer. 
* **No More Concessions:**  We are signaling to Alice that this is our final offer, and we are not willing to go any higher."
