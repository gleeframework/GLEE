"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would need to see it priced closer to $9000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of 12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $11000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to 11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between 12500 and 11000. How about we try 12250?",12250.0,Alice,5,
