(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to you. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with the lowest possible price that I'm willing to pay. This is a strong opening position, as it clearly establishes my limits.  Since Alice is motivated to sell (her product is worth more to her than this offer), it's likely she'll be willing to negotiate from here."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm not yet ready to buy from John because I believe there's still room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate. I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but I'm still significantly below her asking price. I'm aiming to find a price that's fair to both of us, while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but I'm still not ready to accept.  I'm going to see if I can get her down to $1,200,000 before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to show that I'm serious about buying the product.  $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I believe Alice might be willing to accept it. It's still below what the product is worth to her, and it's within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that she might get frustrated and walk away. I'm also running out of rounds.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product for a price that's within my budget and still a good deal considering its value to Alice."
