"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to leave some room for negotiation while still securing a good price. I'm also mindful of the fact that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to secure a deal, I won't settle for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, acknowledging Bob's low offer. However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my valuation. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get him to agree to a price that's closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm also trying to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. If he's not willing to budge much further, I might be better off accepting his offer or selling to John. However, I believe I can still get a better price than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'm not yet convinced that he's willing to pay closer to my valuation, but I'm still willing to continue negotiating for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000} 
```

I'm making a small counteroffer, hoping to meet Bob halfway. We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and I'm still optimistic that we can reach a price that works for both of us. However, if he rejects this offer, I'm getting closer to considering John's offer."
