"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I can do $120, which is the lowest I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $90, but I can try to meet you halfway. How about we aim for $110?",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for sticking with this.  I'm willing to budge a little bit. How about $100 even? That feels like a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $130, which is as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be interested in?",130.0,Alice,7,
