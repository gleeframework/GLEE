Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** $19,000 is a strong opening offer, significantly above Bob's perceived value. While it might seem high, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.
* **Leaving John as Leverage:** You don't need to mention John directly, but knowing you have a backup buyer gives you confidence in setting a higher price.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might outright reject $19,000. However, it's a risk worth taking to potentially secure a much higher profit than your baseline of $15,000."
