Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  However, I'm not being unreasonable, and I'm offering a clear value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair to me."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, it's becoming clear that we're too far apart in our valuations.  To avoid further haggling and ensure a sale at my minimum price, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
