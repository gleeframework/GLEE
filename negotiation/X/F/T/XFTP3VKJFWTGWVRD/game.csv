"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $90 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a fair price, considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are getting close.  I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we split the difference and call it $80?",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I can offer it to you for $82. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",82.0,Alice,7,
