Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.** This gives you room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob.** This incentivizes him to accept the offer and avoid a potential counteroffer. 

I've chosen to use a friendly tone in the message to build rapport and encourage a positive response from Bob."
