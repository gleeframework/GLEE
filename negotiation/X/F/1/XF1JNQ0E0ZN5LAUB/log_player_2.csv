"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer or buy from John immediately.  We haven't gathered any information about Alice's ""bottom line"" yet. Rejecting the offer allows us to start the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. Starting with a lower price allows room for compromise while still leaving us with potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our initial counteroffer. We can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  $750,000 is still a bit too high, so we'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our counteroffer slightly to show we're willing to compromise. This should put us in a good position for Alice to either accept our offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to our desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $700,000, which is significantly better than her initial offer and within our budget.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or we might run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal, and we have saved $100,000 compared to John's price."
