,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you say?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? It's a fair price, and we can both be happy.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there.  $8,000 is my absolute limit. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,4,
