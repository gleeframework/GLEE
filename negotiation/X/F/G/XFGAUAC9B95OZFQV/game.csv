"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I see the value in this product,  $19,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product. I understand your budget constraints, however, $12,000 is significantly below its true worth.  Could you consider $16,500? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $14,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. ",14000.0,Bob,4,
