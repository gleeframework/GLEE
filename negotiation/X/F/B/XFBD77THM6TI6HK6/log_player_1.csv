Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16,000. Can you consider it?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my asking price.  $16,000 is still a bit low, but I want to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and ending up with the lower price from John."
