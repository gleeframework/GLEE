"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's work together to find a price that benefits both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have a budget constraint.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $1,200,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers to you, while being fair to me. Let's work towards an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. Let's go with $1,350,000. This gives us both some room to maneuver and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. How about $1,320,000?",1320000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both making concessions. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,335,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and is close to my target.  Let's close this deal,  I'm confident we can both be happy with this agreement.",1335000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,335,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,335,000. How about $1,316,500?",1316500.0,Bob,8,
