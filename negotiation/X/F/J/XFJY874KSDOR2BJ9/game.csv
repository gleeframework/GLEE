"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product is $8000, and I'm willing to make a further concession to get it to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $10000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000.",11500.0,Alice,5,
