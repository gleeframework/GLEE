"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $140? I think it's a fair price considering my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,4,
