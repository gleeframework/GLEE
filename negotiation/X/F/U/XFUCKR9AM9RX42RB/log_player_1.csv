"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still reasonable. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'd like to see if I can get more from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see what counteroffer he makes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and I'm happy to close the deal."
