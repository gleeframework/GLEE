"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $11,200?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11,000? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
