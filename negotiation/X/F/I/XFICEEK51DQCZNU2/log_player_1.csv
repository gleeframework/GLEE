Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

It's important to note that I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price.  I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John who will pay my minimum. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,150,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to what I believe the product is worth. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering his willingness to pay $1,100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is only $25,000 below my last counter-offer.  At this point, it seems like we are close to a deal.  Further negotiation might take more time and isn't likely to yield a significantly higher price. It's best to accept this offer and secure the sale."
