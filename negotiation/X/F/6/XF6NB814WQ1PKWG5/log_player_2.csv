It's always better to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 
I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to come down a bit. If she rejects this, I'll adjust my offer in the next round based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a good price for me.  It's only $25,000 more than my initial counteroffer, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up buying from John for the full $800,000."
