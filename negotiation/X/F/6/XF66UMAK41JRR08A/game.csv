"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit, and $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I think the product's value to you is clear, and I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,250. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",10250.0,Alice,5,
