Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $850,000 for it, considering your minimum value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. Accepting $850,000 would be leaving a significant portion of potential profit on the table. I'm willing to counter in Round 3 and see if we can reach a more agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. Could you meet me halfway at $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, but I can only go up to $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a good deal, but his offer of $875,000 is now a reasonable compromise. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and provides a good profit. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and secures the sale."
