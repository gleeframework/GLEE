"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You want to pay as little as possible, and $950,000 is still quite a bit more than Alice's minimum. 
* **Counteroffers are possible.**  There are 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate and try to get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a backup.**  While buying from John is a safe option, you might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $850,000 for it, considering your minimum value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. Could you meet me halfway at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down, $900,000 is still significantly above your target.
* **There's room for more negotiation.** You have several more rounds, so you can continue to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safe fallback.** If negotiations with Alice fall apart, you can still buy from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, but I can only go up to $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
