"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $850,000 for it, considering your minimum value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. Could you meet me halfway at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, but I can only go up to $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
