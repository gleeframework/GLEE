"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs and expectations perfectly. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth $80. Would you like to make this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $80 for the product. Alice is offering it for $80, which is your maximum price.  Since John is also selling the product for $80, you have no incentive to accept Alice's offer. You can reject it and buy from John, knowing you'll get the same product for the same price."
