"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $90 is a good one, but I was thinking of something a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get this sale done.",95.0,Alice,3,
