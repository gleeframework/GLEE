"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,350,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. I can do $1,320,000, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,320,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000. This is a fair price that's close to your offer, and it would allow us both to close this deal. Let's see if we can agree on this final price.",1310000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,310,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. I can do $1,315,000, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1315000.0,Alice,7,
