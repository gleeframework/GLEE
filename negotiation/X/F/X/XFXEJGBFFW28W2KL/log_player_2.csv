"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Alice's offer of $900,000 is better but there is still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $800,000.  A counteroffer of $850,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation while still being a significant saving compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is higher than your previous counteroffer of $850,000, and while still cheaper than John's price, it's not a good deal. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is moving closer to your target. A counteroffer of $875,000 is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price below John's offer. This shows you are serious about buying from Alice but are not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your previous counteroffer and is getting closer to John's price. There's a risk that continuing the negotiation will lead to a higher price from Alice, or a stalemate.  Since you can get the product from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's better to secure the deal with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
