# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price.

Bob should reject the offer. While $9,000 is a better price than the initial offer, he can likely still get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. This is my lowest price, and I'm confident that you'll find the product's value to be worth it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.
