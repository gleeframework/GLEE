"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $10,000 isn't enough for me to part with the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still not able to meet at $11,000. I propose $9,500 as a counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while providing you with a reasonable return for your product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
