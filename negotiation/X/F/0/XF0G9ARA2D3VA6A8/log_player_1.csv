Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it at $150 (John's price), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting us a higher profit than the $100 difference between our minimum and his valuation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $140 tempts Bob with a significant ""discount"" while leaving us a comfortable margin above our minimum.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** If Bob rejects this offer, we're secure knowing John will buy it at our desired minimum."
