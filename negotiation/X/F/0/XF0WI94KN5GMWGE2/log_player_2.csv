"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and while I'm confident I can get $1,000,000 from another buyer, I'd prefer to work with you.  This price is fair considering the value you'll gain, and it allows me to secure a good deal as well.  Let me know your thoughts.
