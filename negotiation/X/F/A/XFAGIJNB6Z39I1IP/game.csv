"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and I pay $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
