"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly unique and justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true potential of what we're discussing.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but  $1,700,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $1,100,000? That's a sizable offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  However, the  $1,100,000 offer is still significantly below what I believe is fair.  Let's settle this right now. I'm prepared to accept $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than reasonable considering the value this product represents.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
