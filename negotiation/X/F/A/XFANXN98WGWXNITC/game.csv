"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see where you're coming from. Let's try to bridge the gap.  How about we settle on $94? It's a good middle ground, and I'm sure you'll find the product is worth every penny.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $92? I'm willing to stretch a bit, but I really need to stay within my budget of $80.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $92 is still a bit low for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $93?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",93.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really struggling to go up to $93. How about we try $91? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I really need to stay within my budget.",91.0,Bob,8,
