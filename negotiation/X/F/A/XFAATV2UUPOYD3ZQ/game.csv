"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000.  This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
