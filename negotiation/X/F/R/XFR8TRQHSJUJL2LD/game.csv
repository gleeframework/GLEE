"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. ",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
