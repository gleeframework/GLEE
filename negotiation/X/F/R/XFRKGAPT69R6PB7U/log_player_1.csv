Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John isn't a direct competitor) might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than your backup offer from John while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
