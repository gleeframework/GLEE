I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but I believe it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is genuinely interested. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum price. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still having a fallback option."
