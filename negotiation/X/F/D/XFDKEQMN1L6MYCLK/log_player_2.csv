Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $100 and Alice is now offering $87.50.  This is a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what you'd pay John."
