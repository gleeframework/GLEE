"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $15000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers.",13500.0,Bob,4,
