"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable with $8,750.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm still not comfortable with $8,750.  How about we try $8,900?  That's only $100 more than your last offer, and it's closer to where I need to be.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. $8,900 is getting closer. I'm still aiming to save a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $8,850? That's only $50 away from your offer.",8850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $8,850 is getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $8,875.  Let's just close this deal.",8875.0,Alice,7,
