Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""listing it publicly,"" you subtly imply there might be other interested buyers, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and your minimum, it allows for potential counter-offers and still nets you a good profit. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer, so you're not desperate to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
