"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. How about $6,000?  I'm serious about buying, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $6,750? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $6,750 is closer to Bob's budget, there's still room for further negotiation. Bob has 7 rounds left and should aim to get the price as low as possible. By rejecting, Bob can try to further lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  How about $6,250? This is a good compromise and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 6250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,250. However, I'm willing to make another concession. How about $6,500? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $6,500. Bob has already rejected this price once and has only 5 rounds left to reach an agreement. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will not budge and he will end up paying the full $8,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer at $6,500 ensures a significant saving compared to John's price and allows Bob to purchase the product."
