"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $950,000. This is a unique and exclusive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than her actual value of the product ($800,000), it's lower than the price you'd pay from John ($1,000,000).  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000."
