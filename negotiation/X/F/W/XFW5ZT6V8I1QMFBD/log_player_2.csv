"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds significant value for your business as well. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential, and it allows you to acquire it at a cost lower than what you'd likely spend developing it yourself.  Let me know your thoughts!
