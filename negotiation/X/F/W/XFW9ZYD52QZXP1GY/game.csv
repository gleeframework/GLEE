"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I can offer it to you for $11,250, but I'll throw in a small additional service that's worth $250. This way, you'll get the product and a bonus service for the price you're willing to pay.
