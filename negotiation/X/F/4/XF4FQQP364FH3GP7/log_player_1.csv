Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $100.

Offering the product at $99 gives Bob a chance to buy it at a price he might find attractive (as it's just below your backup offer) while still maximizing your potential profit. If Bob rejects this offer, you can confidently sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
