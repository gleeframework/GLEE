Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, knowing it's more than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range where he might be willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make the offer appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I have John as a backup buyer, allowing me to end the negotiation with Bob and get my desired price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $12,500 is significantly less than my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, as he's shown interest in the product. 
* **Time is not a factor:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but I have time to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. 

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  How about $13,250? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** $13,250 is a middle ground between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to keep the conversation friendly and encouraging.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a compromise that shows I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Next Steps:** I'm asking Bob to consider the offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,250, which would be $12,875. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer, $12,875 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Possible higher offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob is clearly interested in the product. I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a deal below my minimum.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $12,875.  However, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about we split the difference one last time?  I'm willing to drop my price to $13,062.50. That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to your budget than my previous offer.  Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13062.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final compromise, aiming to meet Bob halfway between my previous offer ($13,250) and his current offer ($12,875).
* **Clear Signal:** It sends a clear signal that I'm nearing my limit and am serious about closing the deal.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and compromise to make the offer more appealing to Bob.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000, even though it's a slight increase.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  This negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will lead to a better price.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $15,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.
* **Time is a factor:**  It's time to move on and secure my desired price.

I'm confident that selling to John is the best option for me at this point."
