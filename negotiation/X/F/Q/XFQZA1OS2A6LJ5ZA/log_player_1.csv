``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, but it's also higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This creates room for negotiation, and I can adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $9,750. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm glad we're getting closer, $9,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $10,125? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $9,812.50. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,812.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,812.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. At this point, it's better for me to sell the product to John for $15,000 and avoid any further negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with another buyer in the future."
