# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm interested in buying the product, but I'd like to save some money. Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a good discount from the true worth of $1,500,000, but I can do better. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better deal.
