Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$175** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $150 as possible while still giving Bob a chance to negotiate. 
* By starting high, I have room to lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $150 and even below what the product is worth to him ($80).  Accepting his offer would be a huge loss.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get a price closer to my desired range.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between Bob's offer and my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a compromise price. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* The message is still friendly and encouraging, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* By counter-offering with $120, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to negotiation but not willing to give away the product for a ridiculously low price.
* Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer.
* I'll keep John's offer of $150 in mind as a fallback option if the negotiation becomes too frustrating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $75 is higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. 

**Strategy:**

I'll continue the negotiation by making another counteroffer.  It's clear that Bob is unlikely to accept a price close to my minimum, but I'll try to push for a price closer to $100. If he rejects again, I'll likely sell to John for $150, as the negotiation seems to be going nowhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100** is a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to undervalue the product.
* The message is still friendly and encouraging, reminding Bob that I'm open to reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* By counter-offering at $100, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. 
* If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll likely accept John's offer of $150. It's clear that Bob is unlikely to come closer to my minimum value, and continuing the negotiation might only waste my time."
