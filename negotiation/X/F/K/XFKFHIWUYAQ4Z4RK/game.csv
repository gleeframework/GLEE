,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $130? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can afford it.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $125? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $122.50? I think that's the best we can both agree on.",122.5,Bob,6,
