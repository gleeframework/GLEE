"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good middle ground. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to counteroffer at $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
