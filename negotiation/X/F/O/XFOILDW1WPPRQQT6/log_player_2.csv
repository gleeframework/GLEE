Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within a reasonable range for both parties. It's a good compromise, allowing you to purchase the product for a price significantly lower than John's, but still ensuring Alice gets a profit. Further negotiation might not yield a much better price, and continuing could risk losing the deal to John."
