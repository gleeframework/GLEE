"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it!  I'm starting the price at $150, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, which is the price I can get from another seller. Can you meet me at that price or lower?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $125 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to both walk away happy. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $122 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $122 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $127 as a final compromise. This is the absolute lowest I can go. What do you say?",127.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $127 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $123 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",123.0,Bob,8,
