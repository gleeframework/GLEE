"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,000,000. This is a strong starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit. I believe this offer is attractive to Bob because he values the product at $1,200,000.  

We'll see if Bob accepts, or if he counters with a lower price. If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than my initial offer. I believe I can potentially secure a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round. 

Selling to John for $800,000 is my absolute bottom line, but I'm not ready to accept that price yet, as there's still potential for a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $950,000 with a price of $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still closer to my initial offer and leaves some room for profit. 

By meeting him halfway, I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept the offer without having to go through more rounds of negotiation.  It's also a good tactic to show that I'm serious about making a deal while maintaining my bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is now lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  However, I'm not willing to accept his offer just yet.  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, considering his initial valuation of the product at $1,200,000. 

There are still 6 rounds remaining, and I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $800,000 is my last resort, and I'm not ready to accept that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $925,000 with a price of $950,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 

I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept. He's already shown a willingness to meet me halfway, and this offer maintains a good profit margin for me while staying within the realm of reasonable negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. With only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's only $30,000 lower than my previous counteroffer and is a significant amount higher than John's offer of $800,000.  

With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good profit and avoid the potential of having to sell to John at a much lower price."
