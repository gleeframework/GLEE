"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with my highest desired price, as it's the value the product has for me.  Bob might reject it, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $9,500.  This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. Hopefully, he'll find this acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum desired price.  It's risky to keep negotiating, as I might not get a better offer from Bob and I might lose time. Accepting his offer will allow me to secure a decent price within a reasonable timeframe."
