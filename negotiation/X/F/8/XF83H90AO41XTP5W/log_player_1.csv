I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000 for the product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair deal considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle.
