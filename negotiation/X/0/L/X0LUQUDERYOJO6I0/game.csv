"I appreciate you being open to negotiations. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
