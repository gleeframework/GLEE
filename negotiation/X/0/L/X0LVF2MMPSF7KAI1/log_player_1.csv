Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is leverage. You know John will buy the product for its full value to you ($1,500,000), giving you a strong fallback position.  This allows you to push Bob closer to his maximum valuation.  However, being too greedy could make Bob walk away.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm looking for a price of $990,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 990000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but not unreasonable:** $990,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a substantial deal.
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even though John is your fallback, not a competitor) adds pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **Clear and confident language:**  The tone conveys the product's value and your expectation of a strong offer.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a more extended negotiation, you might start higher and be prepared to adjust based on Bob's responses."
