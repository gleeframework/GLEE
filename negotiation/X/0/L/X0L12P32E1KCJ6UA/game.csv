"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,500,000. I understand the product's worth to you, but my budget allows for a maximum of $1,000,000. I hope we can find a middle ground.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget limitations. However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise while recognizing the product's true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget constraints. I am unable to meet you at $2,000,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,750,000. This is the highest I can go while still considering the product's value to me.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
