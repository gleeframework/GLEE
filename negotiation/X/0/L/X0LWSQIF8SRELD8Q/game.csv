"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is substantial. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could potentially go up to $12,000, but that's my limit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $15,000. How about $15,500? This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
