Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $100 gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $70 is less than my minimum of $80. I cannot accept an offer that would result in a loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $80 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $70 is just a little too low for me. How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within my range:**  $85 is still above my minimum of $80, so I'm not losing money.
* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my initial price, but not going down to Bob's offer.
* **Positive and reasonable tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and emphasizing a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. How about $78? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $78 is less than my minimum of $80.  
* **John's offer is a better deal:** Selling to John for $80 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation.
* **Limited upside:** While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee I'll be able to get him to agree to a price I'm comfortable with. 

Since John's offer is a secure and better deal, selling to him minimizes risk and ensures a reasonable profit."
