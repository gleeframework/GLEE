{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary, and also signals my seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's closer to my budget.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,050,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still trying to get a better price than her last offer. It's also close enough to John's price that if Alice rejects, I can easily switch to him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and only slightly higher than John's price. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a few more rounds with smaller price reductions. It's more efficient to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
