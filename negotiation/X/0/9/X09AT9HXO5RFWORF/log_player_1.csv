"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $8,000. I'll counteroffer and see if I can find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a price closer to my value. I think $8,500 is a fair compromise and hopefully will get Bob to accept."
