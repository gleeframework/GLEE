"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and allows for room to potentially lower the price if Bob's counteroffer seems reasonable. I'm confident in the value of the product and am willing to push for the highest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping that this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still holding out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to get more, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle with John for the same price. I'm confident that I can make up for any lost profit in future transactions."
