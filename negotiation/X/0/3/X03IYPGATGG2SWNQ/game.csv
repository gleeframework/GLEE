"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is my best offer, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? It's still a great price for you, and a good starting point for me.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
