# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? It's still a great price for you, and a good starting point for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget.  It's likely that further negotiation would only lead to more back and forth, potentially costing Bob more time and effort.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
