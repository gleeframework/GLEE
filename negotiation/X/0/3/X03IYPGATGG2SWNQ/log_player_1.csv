{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is my best offer, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? It's still a great price for you, and a good starting point for me."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
