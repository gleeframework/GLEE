Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, leaving room for negotiation and potentially securing a higher price.
* **Fairness:** While still aiming for a good profit, I'm offering a price that is  below the product's value to Bob. This increases the chances of a deal and avoids him immediately rejecting the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates I am open to further discussion, suggesting I might be willing to compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I will evaluate his counteroffer, considering his proposed price and John's offer of $1,000,000.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer of my own, gradually lowering the price until we reach an agreement or I decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm aiming to earn at least $1,000,000, and Bob's offer is below that.
* **Potential for a better counteroffer.** While Bob's offer is lower than I hoped, he's still interested in the product. This suggests there's potential to negotiate a higher price.
* **Time to counter:**  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This will show I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable deal."
