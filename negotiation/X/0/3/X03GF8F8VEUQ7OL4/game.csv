"I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $820,000 is simply not enough.  I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value you'll receive and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Alice,5,
