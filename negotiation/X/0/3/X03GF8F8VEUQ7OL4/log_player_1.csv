Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of time and Bob is not showing much willingness to negotiate further. It's getting closer to my minimum but there are only a couple of rounds left. It's better to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $800,000 than risk getting a lower price with Bob."
