"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $140. I appreciate your honesty, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $150. If you're not able to come down to that price, I'm going to have to explore other options.",150.0,Bob,4,
