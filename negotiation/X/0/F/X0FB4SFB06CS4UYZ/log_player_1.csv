Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John provides a fallback at $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, potentially leading to a price higher than $120.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($150) might make Bob more receptive. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
