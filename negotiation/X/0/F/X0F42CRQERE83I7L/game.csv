"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $15000. Would you consider lowering the price to $10000? I believe this might be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. After reconsidering the market value and our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13000. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Given the value it holds for me, I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm now offering the product to you for $12500, but I'm willing to throw in some additional benefits, such as a free warranty and support package, which would normally cost $1000. This brings the total value to $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my needs and offering additional benefits. While I appreciate the gesture, I must stick to my budget constraints. I am willing to pay $12000 for the product, including all the benefits you've mentioned. I hope this proposal works for you.",12000.0,Bob,6,
