"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $120, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I can do $110, which is a very competitive price considering the product's value. It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110, which would be $105. Would you be willing to accept that price?",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $105. I can do $115, which is a very reasonable price considering the product's value. It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, Alice. I've already gone above my initial budget, and I'm not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to do $90, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Please reconsider and meet me at this price.",90.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can do $105, which is still a good deal for you. It's a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,9,
