"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 doesn't quite cover my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This would be a fair compromise, giving you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair return. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but $1,087,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find some middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,093,750.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to close this deal. What do you think?",1093750.0,Alice,7,
