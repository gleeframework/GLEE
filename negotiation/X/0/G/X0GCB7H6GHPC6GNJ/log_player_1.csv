**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly signaling that he has other options and is willing to walk away from the deal. While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the sale entirely and settling for John's offer of $1,000,000 is too great. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,350,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the potential loss of a sale."
