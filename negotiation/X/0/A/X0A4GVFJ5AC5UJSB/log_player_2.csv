"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,100,000,  given its potential worth to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have John as a fallback option at $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal you're looking for a better price and might be able to secure a deal closer to, or even below, $1,000,000."
