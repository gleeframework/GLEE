"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.  What do you think about a price of $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,1,
