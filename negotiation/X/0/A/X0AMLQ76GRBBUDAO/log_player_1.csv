Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This is a high starting price, reflecting the minimum value I have for the product. It's designed to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay. I'm hoping to get a good return on my investment, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still securing a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price.  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk of losing him as a buyer.  It's better to secure a good price now than risk getting stuck with John's lower offer."
