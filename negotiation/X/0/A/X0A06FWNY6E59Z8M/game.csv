"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1000000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see it's a good price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1000000 to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll sell the product to you for $1080000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
