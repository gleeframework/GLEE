"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To make this work, I could come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially stretch my budget to $1,250,000.  That's a significant investment on my end, but I believe in the product's potential. Let me know if that works for you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
