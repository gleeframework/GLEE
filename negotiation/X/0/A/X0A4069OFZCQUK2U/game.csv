"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to discuss.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market, however,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is my final offer for now.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to its value,  I can't part with it for less than $1,275,000. This is a very competitive price for something of this quality and potential.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the high price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000, so I'll offer $1,262,500. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",1262500.0,Bob,6,
