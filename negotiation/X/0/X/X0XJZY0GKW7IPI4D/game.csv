"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $115 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $110. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'll meet you at $112.50. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",112.5,Alice,5,
