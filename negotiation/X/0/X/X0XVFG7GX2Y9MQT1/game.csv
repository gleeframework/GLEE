"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects the product's true worth while still offering you significant value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. Would you be willing to consider a slight adjustment to $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
