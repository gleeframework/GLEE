Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to counter with $13,500. It's a bit lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, we're nearing the end of the rounds.  At this point, I'm willing to accept $11,000 to secure the sale. It's not my ideal price, but it's significantly better than selling to John for $10,000."
