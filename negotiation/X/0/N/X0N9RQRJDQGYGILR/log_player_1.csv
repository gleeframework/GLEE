Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
