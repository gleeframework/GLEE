"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and it leaves room for us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still allows for a good profit for me, while leaving some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a price I believe is reasonable for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet in the middle at $1,087,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
