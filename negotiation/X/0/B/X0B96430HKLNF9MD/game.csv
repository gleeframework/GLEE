"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value of this product is substantial, and my initial offer reflects that.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't accept a price as low as $800,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the product's value, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its worth to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
