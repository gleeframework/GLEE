Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $100.,175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While I agree it's a great item, $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. This is a great compromise, considering it's worth $100 to you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $130 is still a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm going to offer you a price of $115. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $150. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the product's value, my absolute maximum I can spend is $95.  If that works, I'm ready to close the deal!",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $95, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and my original offer of $130. I'll offer you the product for $112.50. This is my final compromise.",112.5,Alice,7,
