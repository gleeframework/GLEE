Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit above my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it leaves room for us to both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm willing to go a bit lower. I'm offering $8200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for him to go higher. It's risky to accept his offer at this point, as I only have 6 rounds left and might not have the opportunity to counter later."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,600.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 8600}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, we're at a point where Bob is not willing to go significantly higher and we're down to only 4 rounds. There's a chance Bob would come up to my price, but it's risky to continue negotiating. I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
