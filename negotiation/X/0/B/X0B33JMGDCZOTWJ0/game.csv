"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is tempting, I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair compromise and a great deal for you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise.",107.5,Bob,4,
