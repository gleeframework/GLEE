"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,
