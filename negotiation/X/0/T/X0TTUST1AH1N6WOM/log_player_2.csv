"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate a better price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get the sale done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming lower. We'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $8,250? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is consistently meeting us in the middle, which is a good sign. However, we still have some room to negotiate before hitting our walk-away point of $8,000 (Alice's value). Let's try for one more decrease."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. How about we settle this at $8,000 even? That's a fair offer, and it would allow us to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

We're pushing it a bit here, offering Alice her exact valuation. There's a chance she might accept to avoid further negotiation, but we need to be prepared to either concede slightly or walk away if she rejects this offer."
