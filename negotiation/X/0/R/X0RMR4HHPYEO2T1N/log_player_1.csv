Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations high. This leaves room for potential negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice is not desperate, allowing her to aim higher with Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price without revealing Alice's minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a professional and non-desperate tone."
