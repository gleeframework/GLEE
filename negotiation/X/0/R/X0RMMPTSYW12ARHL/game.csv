"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
