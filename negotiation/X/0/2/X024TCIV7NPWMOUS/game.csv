"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the deal. I can do $12,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $12,000 is really the highest I can go.  Would you be open to that?",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I've already mentioned to you that I have another buyer interested in the product for $12,000, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might lose out on a better deal. I can see that you're willing to meet me at $12,000, so I'll meet you there. I'll sell the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,7,
