"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,000.  It's getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is the highest I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
