"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the potential it holds for you, I am extending this exclusive opportunity to purchase it at a special price of $11,500. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the best value while also allowing us to share in the mutual benefits of this transaction. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $11,500 is less than $12,000.
* **It's within your budget:** You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, accepting her offer is the most rational choice in this scenario."
