Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob values it at $1,000,000. This presents a chance to earn a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for Alice ($125,000 over her minimum) while still offering Bob a significant discount ($75,000) compared to his perceived value. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to act quickly.  Using the phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of appeal. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a much higher reward."
