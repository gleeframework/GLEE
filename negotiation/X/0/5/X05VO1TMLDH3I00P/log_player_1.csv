Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price and potentially pique his interest.
* **Direct but Open:** The message is direct about the price but leaves room for Bob's response and potential negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Information:** While you have a guaranteed buyer, understanding the broader market value of your product could influence your strategy."
