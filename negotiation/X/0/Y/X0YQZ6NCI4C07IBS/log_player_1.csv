{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances a desire to maximize profit with the need to be competitive.  It's a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above Bob's perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is lower than the minimum I am willing to accept.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $87 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  John is offering me my minimum, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially since he has indicated he won't go higher.  I'll take John's offer to guarantee a good sale."
