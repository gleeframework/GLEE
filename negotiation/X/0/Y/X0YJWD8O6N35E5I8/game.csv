"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I can do $11000. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $13000? That's the lowest I can go.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11500?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $12500? That's as low as I can go.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I really appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $12250, which is my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",12250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to sell the product for $12250. I think we've reached an impasse. I'm going to have to consider other options.",12500.0,Alice,9,
