Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1150000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You still have room to negotiate as you can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I can offer it to you for $1150000, but I'm not budging from that price. This is my final counteroffer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has stated that $1,150,000 is her final offer.  You have already made your final offer of $1,100,000, which she has rejected.  Continuing to negotiate will likely lead to a stalemate.  It's best to accept the offer from John for $1,000,000 as it saves you $150,000."
