"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it, given my budget constraints.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1150000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1100000.  This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product from John for $1000000 if we can't reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I can offer it to you for $1150000, but I'm not budging from that price. This is my final counteroffer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
