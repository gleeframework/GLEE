Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth, but I'm open to discussion. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value.  I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'd be willing to go up to $950000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired minimum. I'll counter again, but I'll be mindful of the time constraint.  I want to get as close to $1 million as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'll offer $1,000,000.  This is my final offer before I consider selling to John.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not willing to go above $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob aren't likely to yield a significantly better price.  I've already made concessions, and time is running out.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees my minimum desired value and avoids further risk of losing the deal completely."
