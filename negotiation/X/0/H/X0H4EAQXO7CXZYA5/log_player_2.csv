"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high. It's much closer to her valuation than mine, leaving little room for me to benefit. I should counter-offer with a price closer to my budget, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $8,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still above my maximum budget. I'll hold firm and see if I can negotiate her down closer to $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and I'm not willing to pay significantly more than John's price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
