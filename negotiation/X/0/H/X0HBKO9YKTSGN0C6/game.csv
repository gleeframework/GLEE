"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
