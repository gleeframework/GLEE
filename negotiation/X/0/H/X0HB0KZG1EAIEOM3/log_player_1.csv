Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and positive, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I mention the product being ""amazing"" and a ""great fit,"" which subtly implies value without making specific claims.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider whether it's worth my time to continue negotiating or if I should simply sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's room for a counteroffer that might be closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $100. I'll need to be mindful of Bob's budget constraints, but also ensure I'm not selling the product for less than what it's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value proposition by saying ""I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.""
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I emphasize the ""fair price"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and making it more likely he'll accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, we're done. If he rejects, I'll have to carefully consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $100."
