# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While she claims the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, you know you can get it for $1,000,000 from John. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much.  She might come back with a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $800,000.

**Strategy:**

It's likely in your best interest to see if Alice will lower her price before resorting to buying from John."
