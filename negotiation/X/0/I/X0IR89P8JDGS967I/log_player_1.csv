"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and the ""great deal"" it represents for Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message implies I'm open to discussing the price, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to maximize my profit while still securing a deal.  Starting high allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm also prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price of $120. If the negotiation stalls or becomes too time-consuming, I can always sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that leaves me with a significant loss. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal than $80. If the negotiation continues to stall, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to agree. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but suggesting a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a ""great deal"" even at $95.
* **Open to agreement:** I'm emphasizing that $95 allows for ""room to agree,"" implying I'm still open to further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By lowering the price slightly and highlighting the value proposition, I'm trying to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on. I'm still aiming for a profit, but I'm also aware that I need to be realistic and flexible to close the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is my maximum budget for this product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it still falls short of my desired profit margin. I'm not willing to settle for a price that leaves me with a significantly lower profit.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I still have 6 rounds left and believe I can secure a better deal. I'm confident that I can either convince Bob to come up on his price or sell to John for $120 if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway by suggesting a price that's exactly in the middle of our current offers. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity and making it less likely he'll feel pressured to accept a lower price.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm explicitly stating my intention to ""close the deal,"" creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a deal that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but also recognizes Bob's financial limitations. By proposing a compromise, I'm hoping to find a sweet spot where we can both agree and avoid further negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I will reassess my options and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $87.50. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin. I have 4 rounds remaining and believe there is still potential for a better deal.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. My goal is to secure a price closer to $90 or higher. If the negotiation stalls or I feel I'm unlikely to get a better offer, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $89. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. Let's close this now. "", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway by suggesting a price that's closer to his offer, showing that I'm serious about closing a deal. 
* **Fair Price:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity and making it less likely he'll feel pressured to accept a lower price. 
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the importance of ""closing this now"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a deal that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but also recognizes Bob's financial limitations. By proposing a compromise, I'm hoping to find a sweet spot where we can both agree and avoid further negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I will reassess my options and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to pay $86 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $86 is still too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, it's unlikely I'll be able to secure a price that meets my minimum acceptable profit margin in the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation that might not result in a better deal. 

I've reached a point where the potential gains from continuing the negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing time and ultimately settling for a price that's less than what I can get from John."
