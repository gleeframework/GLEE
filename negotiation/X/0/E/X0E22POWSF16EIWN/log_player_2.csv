"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is reasonable, considering its value to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.** You're looking to pay no more than $1,500,000, and her offer is $1,400,000.
* **You have room for negotiation.** There's a potential for Alice to come down in price since she values the product at $1,200,000.

By rejecting the offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $1,300,000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. How about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and her offer is $1,350,000.
* **You're saving money compared to John's price.** John is selling the product for $1,500,000, while Alice is offering it for $1,350,000.

While you could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John and is still within your acceptable price range."
