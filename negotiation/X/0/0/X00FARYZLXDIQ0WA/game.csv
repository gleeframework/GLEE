"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds similar value for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000, which reflects its unique capabilities. Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth, both to me and to you, based on your own assessment. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our positions.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still below what this product is worth.  We're getting closer, and I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm ready to offer you the product for $1,025,000. This price reflects a compromise on both our sides and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's finalize this deal and make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,012,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1012500.0,Bob,6,
