"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $950,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. Can we agree on that price?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is still below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to go down to $940,000. This is a fair compromise and will still give you a great value. Let's close this deal!",940000.0,Alice,5,
