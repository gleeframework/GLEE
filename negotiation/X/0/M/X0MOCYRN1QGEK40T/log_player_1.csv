Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $119. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum:** You know John will buy the product for $120, ensuring you won't make less than that.
* **Maximizing profit with Bob:** You want to get as close to $120 as possible from Bob. Offering $119 leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially accept while maximizing your potential profit.
* **Psychology:**  The slightly discounted price might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even though it's just below your guaranteed sale price. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate, or he might decline outright."
