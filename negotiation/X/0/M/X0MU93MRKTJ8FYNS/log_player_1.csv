Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his initial rejection, but it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I think this shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth a premium.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I would prefer to get closer to $950,000, accepting his offer is a good compromise. Selling to John would only give me $800,000, so it's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a higher price."
