Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower offer ($10,000) allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a price higher than your minimum ($8,000).
* **Secure a Deal:** There's a risk Bob might reject a very high offer. By starting at $10,000, you increase the chances of acceptance while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy balances risk and reward for the best possible outcome."
