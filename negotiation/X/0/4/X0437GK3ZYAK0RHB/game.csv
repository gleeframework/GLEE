"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. That's my maximum budget for this purchase.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. That's the best I can do.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, and I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's settle on $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to avoid selling to John at a lower price.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to get concerned that I might have to walk away and buy from John.",9000.0,Bob,6,
