"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is lower than what you mentioned.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $12000 for it. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the value of our product and your interest, how about we settle at $13500? This is a fair compromise that respects both the product's worth and your budget.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think we can do better. How about $12500 again? I'm willing to stick with this price, but I need to be sure it's the best I can get.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. Would $13250 be acceptable to you? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but still below the product's perceived value to you.",13250.0,Alice,7,
