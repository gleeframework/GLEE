"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I would like to offer the product to you for $125. I hope this meets within your budget and yours as well.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $120.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I am willing to sell the product to you for $120. This is my final offer, as it aligns closely with the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for myself. I hope this meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",120.0,Alice,5,
