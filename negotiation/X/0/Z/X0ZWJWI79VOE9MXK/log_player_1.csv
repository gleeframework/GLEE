"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **It's less than half of Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer attractive to him and increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **It leaves room for potential counteroffers:**  You can still negotiate upwards if Bob offers a lower price. 

By starting strong, you set the tone for the negotiation and give yourself a good chance to secure a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below the value I've set for the product ($1,200,000).  It's better to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low.  Considering the value this product offers you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a substantial profit margin.
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:**  Reminding him of the product's worth to him strengthens my position.
* **Setting a clear expectation:**  This offer creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
