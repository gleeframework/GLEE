Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring if a better price can be negotiated with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with his maximum budget, hoping to get the product for the price he is willing to pay.  There's a significant gap between Alice's value and Bob's, so a lower starting point is crucial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. There's still room for compromise, and buying from John is always a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but still remains within his budget. It's a good strategy to show a gradual increase, suggesting a genuine desire for the product but not being overly eager."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point and his maximum budget. There are still 5 rounds left, so Bob should keep negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price. It's important to remember that John's offer is always a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, but this time by a larger margin. He is demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but still wants to make sure he's getting a good deal. With 4 rounds remaining, he needs to start closing the gap with Alice's price.  If Alice rejects, he might consider accepting the next offer from Alice, or go to John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $11,000 is still above his ideal price, but with only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation leading to a better deal is outweighed by the risk of not reaching an agreement at all.  He can either accept the offer and buy the product, or risk missing out entirely and having to buy from John at $8,000, potentially losing out on a better product."
