"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get elsewhere. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm offering you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away with a win.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us and represents a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
