"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is my best price, but I think it's a great deal for you too!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I can offer it to you for $13,000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a good compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
