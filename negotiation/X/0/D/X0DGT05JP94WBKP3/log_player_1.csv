"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair, acknowledging Bob's perspective, which could make him more receptive.
* **Leaving Room:** This price gives us 5 rounds to reach a compromise if Bob counter-offers. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects the offer and makes a counteroffer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter:**  Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it would mean a large financial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation as we have 8 rounds left. I can likely get a better price than Bob's offer.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John now would secure a good price, but I want to see if I can maximize my profit through further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, while still leaving room for compromise. I'll need to carefully assess the remaining rounds and Bob's potential willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value for Both:** I'm emphasizing that a price of $1,400,000 is beneficial for both of us, ensuring that the deal is mutually advantageous.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 7 rounds left, I still have room for further negotiations if Bob counter-offers again.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to slowly work towards my minimum acceptable price while keeping the negotiations open. I'm aiming for a deal that's as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but I'm also mindful of the risks of a stalemate and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** With 6 rounds remaining, I still have time to try and get a better deal. There's a strong possibility that Bob will increase his offer further, especially if he sees the risk of losing the deal. 
* **John's Offer:** While $1,500,000 from John is tempting, I'm not desperate. It's better to try and squeeze a little more out of Bob, even if it means the negotiation might go down to the wire.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for compromise. I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and Bob's potential willingness to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  However, $1,250,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest one. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, hoping to sway him towards a higher price. 
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing this as an opportunity for both of us to benefit, making the deal more appealing.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 5 rounds left, I'm strategically setting the stage for a potential deal in the next few rounds.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to push Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price without pushing him away. I'll carefully observe his reactions and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I'll consider decreasing my counteroffer incrementally, but I won't go below $1,300,000, as that's close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but  $1,325,000 is the highest I can go right now.  This price still gives you a good profit and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,350,000 at this point.
* **Negotiation Room:** We have 4 rounds remaining, and there's still potential for Bob to increase his offer. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** While $1,500,000 from John is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer, but I'll try to push him just a little higher. I'll need to carefully assess the remaining rounds and his willingness to negotiate to determine the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and your budget limitations. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it gets us closer to finalizing this deal. With only a few rounds left, let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** This counteroffer is a small concession from my previous offer, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Final Rounds:** Emphasizing the limited number of rounds left creates a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Fairness:** I reiterate the fairness of the price, reinforcing the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to push Bob just a little further, hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider John's offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal with Bob."
