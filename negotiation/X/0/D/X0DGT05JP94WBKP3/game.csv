"Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  However, $1,250,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position and your budget limitations. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it gets us closer to finalizing this deal. With only a few rounds left, let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
