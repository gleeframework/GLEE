Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. This will give me the best chance of maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects, I can then assess whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a little to reach an agreement. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
