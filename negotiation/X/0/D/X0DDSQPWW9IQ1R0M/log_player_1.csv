Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $11,500 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly pressure Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  You could offer a different price depending on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
