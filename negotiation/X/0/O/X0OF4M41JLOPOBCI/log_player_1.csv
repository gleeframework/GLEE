I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the minimum value ($1,000,000) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can then negotiate further, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $875,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject and try to negotiate a bit higher."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $912,500.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I could do $893,750.  That's right in the middle of our last offers.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $893,750

While Bob is getting closer, it's clear we're unlikely to reach a price I'm happy with. It's time to move on to John to guarantee my minimum value."
