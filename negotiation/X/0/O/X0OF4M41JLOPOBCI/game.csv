"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $912,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
