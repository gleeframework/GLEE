"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and benefits of the product to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $110 is higher than Bob's perceived value, it's not so high that he'll immediately reject the offer. This gives us room to negotiate over the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, so I need to reject Bob's offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's not far off my minimum. This suggests there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Exploring other options:**  I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $105? It's still a good value for a product like this, and we can close this deal quickly. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $110 to $105, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting a quick close. This might encourage Bob to accept my offer.
* **Remaining above my minimum:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'm still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been considering your offers and I think $100 would be a fair price for both of us. I believe this aligns well with the value of the product and keeps within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further upside:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations.
* **Time constraints:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of time and ending up with a worse deal or having to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Fairness:**  Bob's offer seems fair, considering the value of the product for both of us.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this situation, as it guarantees me my minimum price and avoids potential risks of further negotiation."
