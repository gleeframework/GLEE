"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
