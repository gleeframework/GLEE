"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,800,000 is far above your budget of $800,000. It's not even close to the value you place on the product ($800,000).  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the value you'll gain from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can push for a lower price.  I still have several rounds remaining, and there's a chance Alice may be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my initial offer, but $1,500,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000 for the product, which represents a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $1,000,000 offer is still quite a ways from where I see the value. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000 as a final compromise. This offer reflects the significant value this product offers and represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above my budget of $800,000. While she claims it's a ""final compromise,"" I'm not willing to accept it yet. I still have a few rounds left to negotiate and see if I can push for a lower price.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget or at least get her to accept my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your position, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we work together."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
