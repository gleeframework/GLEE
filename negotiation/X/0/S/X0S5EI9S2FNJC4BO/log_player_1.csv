Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies that the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you invite him to engage in a dialogue and potentially counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secured buyer (John) at $12,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
