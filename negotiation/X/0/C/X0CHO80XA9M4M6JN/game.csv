"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's continue this discussion and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,000,000? This would be a significant saving for me while still giving you a good return on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer and propose $1,025,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $1,010,000.  This offer reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal now.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
