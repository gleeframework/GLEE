"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Would you like to make it yours at this exclusive price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it at $120, there's no benefit in accepting her offer. Bob can get the product for the same price from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob keeps the option open to potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
