Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm confident this product is worth more.

I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Bob's counteroffers are getting closer, but I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that meets my minimum price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
