"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation to see if a better price can be reached before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial ask.
* **Showing Interest:**  Bob emphasizes his interest in the product to keep the negotiation going.
* **Reasonable Counter:** While $12,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's a more realistic starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's target.  Bob is willing to negotiate further to see if he can get a better deal. There's still room to move closer to Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow me to purchase the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Bob acknowledges Alice's compromise but maintains his position of wanting a lower price.
* **Meet in the Middle:** The counteroffer of $14,000 is a halfway point between Alice's offer and Bob's previous counteroffer. 
* **Positive Framing:** Bob frames the offer as a good deal for both parties, emphasizing the win-win potential of the agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000?  This is my final offer, and it's a great price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, but it's still $5,000 higher than his maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a gap between their positions, and Bob wants to see if he can close the gap further.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While Alice claims this is her final offer, there's still a chance she might come down further if Bob holds firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Bob demonstrates persistence and a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget.
* **Small Increment:** The counteroffer of $13,500 is a relatively small increase from Bob's previous offer, signaling a desire to find common ground.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** Bob emphasizes the need for a mutually beneficial outcome, reminding Alice that a deal is possible if they both show flexibility."
