"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow me to purchase the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000?  This is my final offer, and it's a great price for both of us. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,
