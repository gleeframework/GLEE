"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is above my budget. Given my research and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints. I'm confident this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price of $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm willing to negotiate, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. This demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise while still reflecting the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the value to me and your willingness to negotiate, I'm offering $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $980,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while hopefully meeting your budget.",980000.0,Alice,5,
