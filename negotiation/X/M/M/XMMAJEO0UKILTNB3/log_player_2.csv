"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $1,100,000 is above his budget, and he can always get the product from John for $800,000. He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price of $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.

Alice's offer:
