Alice's offer is far too high. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and offers exceptional value. Could you meet me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  I can get it from John for less.  I'll try to negotiate with Alice, but I'm ready to walk away if she doesn't come down in price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you think it's top-of-the-line, but I'm still only comfortable with $11,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm serious about wanting to buy this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $12,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still too high for me, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
