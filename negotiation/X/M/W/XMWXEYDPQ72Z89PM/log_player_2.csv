"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's original price, but it's still above your maximum value of $1,200,000.  This should open the negotiation and hopefully get Alice to meet you somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum value, it's still a bit too high.  There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's offer and is still below your maximum value.  This could be a good compromise point, as you're getting a better price than Alice's last offer, but you're also getting a product you value at $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down a little, but her last offer is still higher than what you are willing to pay. It's time to cut your losses and move on to John, who is willing to sell the product for your maximum price."
