"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with my ideal price of $1,200,000.  This is the price that John is willing to pay, so I'm leaving myself no room for loss if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but not too much.  $1,100,000 is still a good price for me, and it gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob. There's still a chance he might be willing to come up higher, and I don't want to miss out on potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer again to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping that it will convince Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'm still confident I can sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement.  I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, and he's shown a reluctance to increase his offer.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
