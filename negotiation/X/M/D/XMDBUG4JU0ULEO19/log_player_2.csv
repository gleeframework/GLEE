(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He is aiming to start the negotiation with a lower price.  $12,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, which might encourage her to counter with a more agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than the $15,000 he can get from John. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has demonstrated some flexibility. There's still room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but still wants to save money. This offer is a compromise, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't go above his limit.  It also leaves room for Alice to counter with a price that's still profitable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is now the same as the price John is offering.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there is no guarantee that he can get a lower price from Alice. Accepting this offer ensures he gets the product at his maximum budget without risking further negotiation rounds."
