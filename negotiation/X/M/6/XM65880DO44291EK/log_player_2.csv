"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's better to see if you can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $20,000. This establishes your serious intent to buy while also giving room for negotiation.  This aggressive approach might pressure Alice into accepting, but if not, it allows for further negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,500 is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price point.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation.  Buying from John is still a backup option, but it's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by dropping her price to $17,500. I'm increasing my offer to $14,000, which is a reasonable compromise and shows I'm serious about making a deal. This leaves room for a potential final negotiation to reach a price around my desired $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has dropped her price again, showing willingness to compromise. I'm increasing my offer to $15,000, making it a final push before potentially buying from John. This is a small increase from my previous offer, indicating I'm getting close to my limit. This move might pressure Alice into accepting or making a final counteroffer closer to my desired price."
