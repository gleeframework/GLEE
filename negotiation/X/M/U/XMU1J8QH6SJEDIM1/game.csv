"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the discount you're offering. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This reflects a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $862,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the discount you're offering. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",862500.0,Bob,4,
