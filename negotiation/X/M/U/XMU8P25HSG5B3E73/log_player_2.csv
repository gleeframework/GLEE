"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible. While $75 is a good price, there's potential to negotiate further and get it even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for counteroffers and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $60 is a reasonable move. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected. This allows for some wiggle room in the negotiation while still aiming for a substantial saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but it's still above my target price.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, especially with several rounds remaining.  I'm not willing to settle for $70 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  I'm increasing my counteroffer to $65, which is a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $68 is very close to my target price. It's worth accepting as it saves a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise or even withdraw the offer completely.  It's better to secure the deal at this price rather than risk losing the opportunity to buy it at all."
