Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This creates room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, justifying the higher price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is friendly and uses phrases like ""I believe"" and ""What do you think?"" This signals that you're open to discussing the price further if Bob shows resistance. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario, you maximize your profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You can gauge his interest and potentially meet somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000. 
* **Bob Rejects:**  No loss for you, as you can proceed with selling to John at your desired minimum price."
