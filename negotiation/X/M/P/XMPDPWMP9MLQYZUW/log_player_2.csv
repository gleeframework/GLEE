Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He is willing to pay no more than $120, so $155 is still too high. He should try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $155 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's split the difference and see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
