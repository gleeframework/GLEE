"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price closer to your $100 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm still aiming to stay under $100, though. Would you be willing to do $110? That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $115, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is already a compromise for me, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get her down to your target price. However, you're approaching the point where buying from John might be a better option if you don't see a chance to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming to stay under $110.  How about we split the difference and do $112.50? That's a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $112.50. I'm willing to meet you at $118, but that's as low as I can go. This product is worth more than that to me, and I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you've already gone through six rounds of negotiation. With only three rounds left, the likelihood of Alice going lower than $118 is low.  It's more efficient to buy the product from John for $100, which is within your budget and guarantees a purchase."
