{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll recognize its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going over, ensuring you maximize your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $800,000. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
