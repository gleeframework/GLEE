Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000. This information is not useful for setting an initial price beyond understanding he might be hesitant at prices significantly higher than that.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, effectively setting your minimum selling price.
* **Aim High:** Starting with a higher offer ($19,000) allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to lower the price while still staying above your minimum.  

**Important:** It's unlikely Bob will accept this initial offer. However, it sets the stage for a negotiation where you can gradually lower the price (if needed) while gauging Bob's interest."
