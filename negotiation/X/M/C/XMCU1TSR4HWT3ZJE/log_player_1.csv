Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my target price, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. While Bob might not accept this initially, it sets a clear starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a compromise, slightly lower than my initial price but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my goal of getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $108 is still a bit less than I'd like, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of the deal."
