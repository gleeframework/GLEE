"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It also gives Bob some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping he sees value in the product and is willing to pay close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $140.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price for me.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $130 is a good price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up selling to John for $100."
