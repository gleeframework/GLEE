{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100. With only 3 rounds remaining, the chance of negotiating a lower price is diminishing.  It's more efficient and cost-effective for Bob to buy the product from John at his set price of $100. This ensures he gets the product and saves time, potentially missing out on other opportunities while continuing to negotiate with Alice."
