Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $90 is too low for me. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $102.50?  It's still a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I think that's a more reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  $95 is still too low for me. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground, but I'm also aware of the risk of going too many rounds and potentially missing out on the sale to John. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but $95 is still too low for me. How about $100?  This is my final offer, and I think it's fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
