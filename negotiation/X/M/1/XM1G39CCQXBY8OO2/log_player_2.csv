"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You know you can get the product for $150 from John. Alice has offered the same price, so there's no benefit to negotiating further.  You might be able to get a better deal from Alice, but there's no guarantee, and it would take more time. Buying from John is the safest and most efficient option."
