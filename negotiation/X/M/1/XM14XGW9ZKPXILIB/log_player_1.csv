I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate since the product is worth the same to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $750,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."

Bob's offer is my minimum desired price, so accepting it is the best course of action. It guarantees me the full value of the product without any risk."
