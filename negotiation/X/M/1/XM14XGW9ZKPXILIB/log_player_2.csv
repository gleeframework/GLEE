"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate.**  By rejecting, you open the door for a counteroffer and potential savings. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If negotiations fail, you have a guaranteed alternative at your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting lower:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to get a better deal. 
* **Reasonable offer:** $750,000 is still within my budget and a fair starting point for negotiations.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will give me an idea of how flexible Alice is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is coming down in price, but not enough.**  While $850,000 is closer to my target, it's still $50,000 more than I want to pay.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Alice is showing some flexibility, indicating there's room for further compromise. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.** However, I want to see if I can push Alice further before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This is my maximum price. I'm prepared to pay $800,000, but I'm not willing to go higher. 
* **Testing Alice's limits:** By offering my maximum, I'm putting the ball in Alice's court. If she's truly motivated to sell, she'll accept. 
* **If rejected, I'll buy from John:**  If Alice rejects, I'll move on to John without further negotiation, as there's no point in going lower."
