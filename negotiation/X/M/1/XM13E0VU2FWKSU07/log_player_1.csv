Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm offering $18,000.  This is a compromise, but still a good profit for me.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I hoped for, it's a good deal for me and saves me the hassle of continuing to negotiate. It's also a better deal than selling to John for $15,000."
