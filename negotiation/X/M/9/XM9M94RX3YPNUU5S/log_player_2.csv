"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our product to you. Given its exceptional value and benefits, we believe it's worth $950,000 to secure it for you today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than what John is offering, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($800,000).  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must respectfully decline the counteroffer. Our product has a significant value that justifies a higher price. I am willing to negotiate further, so let's aim for a compromise that respects both our interests. How about considering $900,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price and what the product is worth to Alice. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your consideration. After evaluating our costs and the value proposition, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at $890,000 for the product. This price reflects the product's true worth while allowing for a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $890,000.** This is lower than Bob's previous counteroffer of $875,000. 
* **Buying from John would cost $1,000,000.** This is significantly higher than Alice's offer. 
* **Alice is likely to reject any further counteroffers.** She's already come down from her initial price of $900,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action for Bob. He can secure the product for a price that's within his budget and saves him $110,000 compared to buying from John."
