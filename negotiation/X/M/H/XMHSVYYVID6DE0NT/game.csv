"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to be flexible, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,500. Can you think about it and see if you can meet me at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,875? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would be a great deal for you.",10875.0,Alice,5,
