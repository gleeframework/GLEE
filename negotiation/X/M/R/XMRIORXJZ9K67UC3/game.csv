"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $875,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value and our respective positions.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I can offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into finding a buyer.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product, while also reflecting a price point that aligns with my budget.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I can offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Alice,7,
