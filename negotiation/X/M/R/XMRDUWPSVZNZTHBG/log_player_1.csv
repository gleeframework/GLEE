Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $119. I know you'll find it valuable, and this is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $120 (its worth to me) and guarantee a sale to John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($120) creates a sense of urgency and makes the offer more enticing to Bob. It's unlikely he'll find a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a ""take it or leave it"" scenario in our prompt, setting the price at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob attempts to negotiate down a dollar or two. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a profitable sale if he declines."
