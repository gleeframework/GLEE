"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I am willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully and while it's closer to my budget, I still feel there might be room for further negotiation. I am willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already met you halfway and offered you a price of $1100000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is as low as I can go.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
