Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find quite valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it at $100, I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down a little, potentially settling around $120-$125. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have a fallback option with John at $100, so we don't want to go below that.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the deal."
