"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the product is valuable, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, $500,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $900,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit steep. How about we try $650,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $650,000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $1,000,000? This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
