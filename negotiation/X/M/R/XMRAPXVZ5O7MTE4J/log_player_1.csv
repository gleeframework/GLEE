Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice doesn't know this. It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $10,000 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has the safety net of John who will buy the product for $12,000. This allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's ""unique value"" to justify the price without revealing Alice's bottom line."
