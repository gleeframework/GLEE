Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), I aim high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 allows for some negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's value and encourages him to accept.
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
