Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $1,500,000 aims to capture some of the potential value above Bob's perceived worth.
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message implies it's significant by using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential.""

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance, you might choose a different strategy."
