Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $11,000 is quite a bit below the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  $12,000 is quite close to my bottom line, and I'm hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal: $12,500.  This offer takes into account your budget constraints while recognizing the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  $12,500 is a reasonable compromise â€“ we save $2,500 from John's price and Alice gets a price above her perceived value.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results."
