"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a discounted price, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than the $15,000 you'd pay John.  Even though the product is worth $15,000 to you, getting it for $12,000 represents a substantial saving.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most advantageous decision."
