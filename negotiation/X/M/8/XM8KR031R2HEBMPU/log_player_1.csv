"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a valuable asset that would be a great addition to your portfolio. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening the negotiation with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This establishes a strong starting point and gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a mutually beneficial opportunity, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By offering a higher price, I anticipate a counteroffer from Bob, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob acknowledges the product's value, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Exploring options:** I'm not ready to sell to John for $1,000,000 yet. I want to see if I can secure a higher price through continued negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I acknowledge your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. I believe this reflects the true value of the product for both of us. Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired outcome but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to both of us, suggesting a win-win scenario. 
* **Bridging the Gap:** By stating my willingness to ""bridge the gap,"" I'm signaling flexibility and an openness to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm maintaining a price point that's still above my absolute minimum ($1,000,000) to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am able to increase my offer to $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my desired price:** Although Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my ideal outcome. I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can secure a higher price.
* **Seeking a better deal:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to push for more. I see this as an opportunity to potentially earn more by rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations.
* **Time is on my side:** I still have plenty of rounds left, and I haven't reached my minimum acceptable price. This gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal. 

**I am not ready to sell to John yet. I believe there is still potential to achieve a higher price with Bob.**"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,075,000. This price point reflects the product's unique value and the potential for mutual benefit. I believe we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter-offer:** I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, but it's still within a reasonable range. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting the product's value and the potential for a positive outcome for both of us. This helps build a more collaborative negotiation atmosphere.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  I continue to use language that emphasizes the possibility of finding a common ground.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't settle for less than I'm willing to accept.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'm not giving up on a better deal and preserving my position."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective and I am willing to meet you halfway. I propose an offer of $1062500 for the product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is a factor:** We are nearing the midpoint of the negotiation rounds. It's important to consider that we have limited time to reach an agreement. 
* **Risk of losing a better deal:** If I keep rejecting offers, I risk Bob walking away, or worse, the other buyer, John, might withdraw his offer.
* **Potential for future gains:** While this offer isn't ideal, it is a solid starting point. If I accept, I can always reinvest the earnings and potentially make even more money in the future.

**By accepting this offer, I can secure a good deal with Bob and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether.**"
