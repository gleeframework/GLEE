Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $80. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you!

This is the best possible outcome for Bob. Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and waiting any longer risks her withdrawing the offer completely.  Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's offer."
