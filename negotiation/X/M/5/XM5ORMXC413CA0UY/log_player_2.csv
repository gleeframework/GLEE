Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can do $10,250. It's the best I can do, and I think you'll find it's worth every dollar.

It's clear Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000.  At this point, John's offer is the best deal."
