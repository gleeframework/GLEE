"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I think it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might incentivize her to lower the price further, getting you a better deal."
