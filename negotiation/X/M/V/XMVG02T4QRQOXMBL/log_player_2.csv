"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a good deal, Bob can still try to get a better price. He has room to negotiate since he's willing to pay up to $100, and the product is only worth $80 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows him to explore if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $92. How about we meet in the middle at $88? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is good:**  $88 is a good price for Bob. It's within his budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John.
* **No need to risk it:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will walk away, or that John might increase his price.  It's better to take the deal while it's still favorable."
