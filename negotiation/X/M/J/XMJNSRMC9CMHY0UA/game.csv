"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
