"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate the opportunity but $1500000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is what the product is worth to me and the price I could get it from another seller.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount, but I have to consider my own costs and margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1400000 for this product. Can you consider meeting me at $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1350000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to go up to $1250000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1350000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1300000 for this product. Can you meet me at $1300000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1250000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the price I can get it from another seller.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
