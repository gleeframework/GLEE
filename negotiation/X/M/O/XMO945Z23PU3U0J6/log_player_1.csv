Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Balance:** $115 gives Bob a good deal while ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob counteroffers. 

This approach balances maximizing my profit with ensuring a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $105? That's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** While $105 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value of $100. 
* **Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. He's already shown interest in the product and acknowledged its value to him.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** A counteroffer will allow me to test Bob's true willingness to pay and potentially secure a higher price. 

I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum value, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a well-crafted counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for me.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob, emphasizing the  ""great price"" aspect to incentivize him.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The tone is still friendly and encouraging further dialogue. I'm not closing the door to further negotiation, but I'm firmly setting my minimum acceptable price. 

This counteroffer strategically positions me to potentially secure a mutually beneficial deal while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
