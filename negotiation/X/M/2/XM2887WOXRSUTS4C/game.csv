"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to my company, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to move forward with the purchase.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still committed to getting a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about $1,100,000?  This price acknowledges the product's potential for your company while remaining within a reasonable range for me.  Let's find a middle ground and move this deal forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to get a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is the highest I can go. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value to my company.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite cover the value and costs associated with this product.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $1,050,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my company's budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $975,000 is the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay above $975,000. Let's try $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to achieve a successful outcome. I hope we can reach an agreement in the next round.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $980,000 just isn't enough to cover the value and expenses associated with this product.  Let's split the difference and agree on $990,000. This way we both get a fair deal, and I can move forward with the transaction.  This is my final offer, let's make it happen.",990000.0,Alice,9,
