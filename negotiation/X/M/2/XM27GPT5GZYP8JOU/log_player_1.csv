"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for me.  It's important to set the bar high to maximize potential earnings.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if he's willing to negotiate or if he's going to counter with a much lower offer."

I'm counteroffering with $875,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still allows me to make a good profit. It's a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, which hopefully will encourage him to close the deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still a good deal for both of us. It shows that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also not willing to give away too much. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I believe there's still room for a better deal. We're getting down to the wire, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll be sending a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 840000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $840,000.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still higher than my minimum price.  I'm hoping that by showing flexibility, I can finally get Bob to accept the offer.  With only a few rounds left, I need to find a balance between earning as much as possible and closing the deal."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 830000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm going down to $830,000, which is only $10,000 above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will finally convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John for $800,000."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but with only one round left and Bob's offer still below my minimum, I have to choose to sell to John. I've done my best to negotiate with Bob, but we couldn't reach a deal. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoid risking losing everything by holding out for a better offer."
