"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle around $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
