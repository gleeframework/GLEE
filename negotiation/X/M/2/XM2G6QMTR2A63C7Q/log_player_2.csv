Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you in the middle, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be conservative with your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $760,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $792,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $792,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $792,500

""product_price"": 780000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're very close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about $795,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is clearly trying to squeeze out the best possible price.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely we'll get much lower than $795,000.  Accepting this offer secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
