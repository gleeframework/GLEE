"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $150. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's a bit high for me to pay more than that.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $175 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value it offers. Can you consider my offer?",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for less than $190. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $185. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $185 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $180 for the product, and I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider my offer?",180.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for less than $190. I'm willing to make one more compromise and meet you at $182. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",182.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise again, but $182 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $178 for the product, and I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider my offer?",178.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $178 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for less than $190. I'm willing to make one more compromise and meet you at $187. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",187.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but $187 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I can't get it for a better price. I'm willing to pay $175 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $100.",175.0,Bob,10,
