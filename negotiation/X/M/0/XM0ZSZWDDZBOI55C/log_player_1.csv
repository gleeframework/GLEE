"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a fair starting point, considering my minimum value is $150.  I'm hopeful Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to settle for the minimum just yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial offer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I could continue negotiating, the time is running out, and it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. It's better to sell to John for $150 and avoid risking further losses."
