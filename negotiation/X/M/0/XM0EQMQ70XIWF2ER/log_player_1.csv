Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your company. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $1,200,000 is higher than Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, giving you room to negotiate downwards if needed. 

This approach aims to secure a deal with Bob while ensuring you get a price closer to your desired value. If Bob rejects, you can always adjust your offer or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is the maximum I can afford for the product, considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I understand his budget constraints, accepting his offer would result in a huge loss for me. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. This gives me the opportunity to try and reach a more acceptable price.  If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my original offer.  This price reflects the value the product will bring to your business and gives us both a good outcome.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $1,100,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob's business, reinforcing the potential benefit of accepting my counteroffer. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is the maximum I can stretch to, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  

If negotiations ultimately fail, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I receive my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to an agreement.  I believe this is a good opportunity for both of us, let's see if we can make it work."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between our last offers, showing a commitment to finding a solution.
* **Still above my minimum:** $1,025,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, allowing for some room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob. 

By offering a price that is closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum, I hope to reach an agreement that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my target of $1,000,000. I'm offering $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $975,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I've shown flexibility throughout the negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

Given that this is Bob's final offer, I believe it's in my best interest to move on.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I receive my desired value and avoid a potentially long and unproductive negotiation with Bob."
