{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,200,000 as my initial offer. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and explains the reasoning behind the price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By starting with a slightly higher price, I create room for negotiation while still leaving myself a good profit margin. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent counteroffers, but hopefully, the initial offer will make him consider my proposal. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an initial offer. Based on Bob's response, I may adjust my strategy and counteroffers accordingly.
* John's offer of $1,500,000 serves as a safety net, allowing me to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if his counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  

While I want to maximize my profit, it's also important to maintain some flexibility. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting his offer, I show Bob that I'm serious about getting a better price. My counteroffer in the next round will be higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer, giving him room to negotiate while still maintaining my profit margin."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've lowered my price to $1,100,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and express my willingness to compromise. I highlight the discount compared to my initial offer, emphasizing that it's still a profitable deal for both of us.
* **Strategy:** By lowering the price and offering a clear rationale, I'm aiming to incentivize Bob to accept while maintaining a healthy profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a little more.  Since I have a safety net with John's offer, I can afford to be a bit more firm in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to come up to $1,050,000.  However, that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your value and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,125,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and emphasize my willingness to compromise, demonstrating flexibility. I position my counteroffer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Strategy:**  By offering a price halfway between our previous offers, I'm aiming to signal that I'm serious about finding a solution while still keeping the price higher than Bob's perceived value. This could encourage Bob to accept the offer or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,125,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not convinced that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a more favorable outcome.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal with John.  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob, my priority is to maximize my profit, and John's offer provides a much better financial outcome."
