"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to come up to $1,050,000.  However, that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your value and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,125,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
