You can do better than $90.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get a lower price."

I'm offering $85. It's a fair price that's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still too high. I will counter offer again."

I'm going up slightly from my previous offer to $87, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm still working towards a price that's comfortable for me."

Alice is not willing to budge much, and I'm getting frustrated with the back and forth. It's better to cut my losses and buy from John for $100. It's only $10 more than my initial counter offer, and at this point, I'm willing to pay a bit more for certainty."
