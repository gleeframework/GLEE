Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring you secure a significant profit above your minimum.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This offer is closer to your maximum within the ZOPA, maximizing your potential gain.
* **Confident Tone:**  You're not desperate, and your message reflects the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While you've set a high price, the message implies you're open to discussing terms, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening move. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate or even reject your initial offer. You have the leverage of another buyer, but a successful negotiation often involves finding a middle ground that benefits both parties."
