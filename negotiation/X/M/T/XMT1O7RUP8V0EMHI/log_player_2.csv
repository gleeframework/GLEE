Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $12000 is a tempting price, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of the product. How about we split the difference and settle on $15000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.
