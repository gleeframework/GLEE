Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $17,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob's counteroffer is $12,000. This is the maximum amount he's willing to pay and what he can get from John. He's hoping Alice will accept, but if she doesn't, he's prepared to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his target price. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get a better price, especially since John is offering a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's offering $13,000, which is a compromise between his maximum price of $12,000 and Alice's last offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable offer that could potentially persuade Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to his budget, he's still hoping for a better deal. There are still rounds left, and he can always buy from John if he doesn't get the price he wants from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob is again trying to find a middle ground. He's offering $13,500, which is a compromise between his last offer of $13,000 and Alice's last offer of $14,000. He's hoping to find a price both parties can agree on, but is still prepared to walk away and buy from John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $14,500 is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his target price. There are still rounds left, and he's not desperate yet. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as he could potentially get a better deal, especially since John is offering a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

Bob is getting close to his limit but is still trying to negotiate. He's offering $13,750, which is a compromise between his last offer of $13,500 and Alice's last offer of $14,500. This is a good compromise that could potentially persuade Alice to accept. He's confident he can get the product at a lower price than Alice's current offer, but he's also aware that he needs to be flexible to close the deal."
