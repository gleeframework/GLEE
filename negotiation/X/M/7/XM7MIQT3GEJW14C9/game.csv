"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, and understand your perspective on the price. Considering the product's unique features and long-term value, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I've been giving your offer serious thought and I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,350,000 is a little too low for me to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I think that reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $1,320,000. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the product's value.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
