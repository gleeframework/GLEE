Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is still a great price for such a fantastic product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $95 as my offer for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105 for this product. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with $100 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise considering the value you're providing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is still a little below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm getting closer. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll try one more counteroffer before considering his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a solution. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $100 still isn't quite there for me. How about $102? It's a small difference, but it gets me closer to my target. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $101 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the quality and value it provides. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $101
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I'm very close to my minimum acceptable price, but Bob is only willing to go up to $101. I've had 8 rounds of negotiation, and while I'm close, I'm running out of time. To avoid risking losing out completely, I'm going to take John's offer of $120.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's a much better deal than selling to Bob for $101."
