"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is still a great price for such a fantastic product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105 for this product. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let's make this deal happen!",105.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a solution. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $100 still isn't quite there for me. How about $102? It's a small difference, but it gets me closer to my target. Let's close this deal!",102.0,Alice,7,
