"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good idea to accept Alice's offer since you're willing to pay $10,000 maximum. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has moved closer to your price, $11,000 is still more than you're willing to pay. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You are still closer to John's price, so there's room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500.  It's fair considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9500, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still more than you're willing to pay.  You've already stated that you're comfortable with $10,000.  Since John is selling the product for $10,000, it's better to buy it from him than to continue negotiating with Alice.  There's a good chance Alice will keep dropping her price, but it's not worth the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer."
