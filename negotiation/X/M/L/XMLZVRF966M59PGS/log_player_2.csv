You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $15,000, which is more than Alice's offer. I can save $1,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John.
