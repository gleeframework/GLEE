"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a decent profit while still staying within my budget. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
