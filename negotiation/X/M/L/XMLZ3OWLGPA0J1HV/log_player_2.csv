Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.

While $14,000 is better than $18,000, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."

While $13,500 is a better offer than before, it is still above my limit of $8,000. I will buy the product from John for a lower price."
