Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement you've made so far. To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If that's workable, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has made it clear this is his ceiling. Accepting the $800,000 offer is a significant profit over my minimum and a good business decision."
