Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get closer to my desired value.  I'm aware that Bob values the product lower, but this sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm going to counter with a lower price, but not too low, to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $160.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is close to my minimum of $150, and I'm confident I won't get a better deal from him.  It's time to close the deal."
