Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility on price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a fallback option with John ($100), so you're not desperate to make a deal with Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, we started high for a reason. There's still a chance to negotiate a slightly higher price, even if it's not the full $150. We'll counter-offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $125?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing flexibility by moving towards his price.
* **Middle Ground:**  $125 represents a fair compromise, splitting the difference between our initial offer and his counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Value:** We're still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum, maximizing potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my desired spending limit while acknowledging the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $110 is still a profitable price for us, exceeding our minimum by $10. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Bob seems set on a price close to his budget.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time. Accepting now secures the sale and allows us to move on."
