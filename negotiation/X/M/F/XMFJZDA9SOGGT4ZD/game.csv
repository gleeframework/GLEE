"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price and offer it to you for $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $8,750? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us closer to the middle ground.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm closer to meeting you halfway, $8,750 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $9,000. If that works for you, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
