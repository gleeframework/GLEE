{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a clear expectation of a higher price than his initial assessment.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I will counter Bob's offer and try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than what he initially offered.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while ensuring I still get a price that's closer to my minimum goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1050000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I will counter his offer again to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway. I appreciate that. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still lower than my previous counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise, and keeps the negotiation moving towards a possible agreement.  If this offer fails, I'll need to reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. Further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better result for me. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
