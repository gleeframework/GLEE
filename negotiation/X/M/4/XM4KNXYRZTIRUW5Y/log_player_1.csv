This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum but allows room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll see how low he's willing to go before I consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's still closer to my desired price than John's offer.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to adjust your offer. Given my financial situation, I would like to propose purchasing the product for $1,075,000. This amount still provides a good balance between our interests and I believe it could be mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's only $25,000 away.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John isn't worth it. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
