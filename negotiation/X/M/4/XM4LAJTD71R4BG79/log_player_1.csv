Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $13,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not ready to accept $11,000, as it's below my minimum price of $10,000.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $12,000?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I think $11,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really can't go any higher than that. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a bit more. While I appreciate Bob's persistence, $11,000 is not a good enough price for me yet. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price, which is $10,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your $11,000 offer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but I really need to be closer to that price. Can you consider going down to $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is offering $11,250, which is higher than John's offer of $10,000. Accepting this offer will get me closer to my desired price and is a better outcome than selling to John."
