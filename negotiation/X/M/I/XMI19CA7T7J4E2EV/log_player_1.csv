Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I could be persuaded to go down to $130.  This item is really worth it, and I think you'll be happy with it."",

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While we could potentially push Bob further, his offer of $110 is still a reasonable profit above our minimum ($100).  It's better to take this solid offer now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
