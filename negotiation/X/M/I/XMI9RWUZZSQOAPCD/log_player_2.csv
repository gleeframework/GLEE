"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, Bob can likely do better. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. He's offering a significant discount from her initial price, but he's also showing that he's willing to negotiate. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while also pushing Alice closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $115 is closer to his desired price, he can still do better. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. He can likely get closer to his $105 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to meet Alice halfway.  He's showing a willingness to compromise, while still pushing for a price that's closer to his ideal. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward, and it could lead to a deal that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $112.50. It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to $100 as possible. While $112.50 is getting closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's also likely considering that he can get the product from John for $100, so he's not in a rush to accept just yet. He'll likely make a counteroffer to try and get the price lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $112.50, but I'm still a little too high for me. Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to pay $111.25.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 111.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically using his knowledge of John's offer as leverage. He's willing to pay a bit more than John's price, but he's still trying to squeeze out the last bit of savings. He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's also not afraid to walk away if the price isn't right. This counteroffer is a strong move that could push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112.00. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $112 is the absolute lowest she'll go. Bob is now only $12 away from his goal of $100.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice has shown a stubborn streak. While Bob could continue to counteroffer, the risk of Alice rejecting his offers and losing precious time is high.  Since John is offering the product for $100, it's a safer and more efficient choice for Bob to buy the product from John."
