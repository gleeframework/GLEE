"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm open to offers, but I'm looking to get at least $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $90? I think that's a fair price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $95?  That's a pretty good price for this product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
