"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price is fair and allows for a comfortable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This recognizes its worth while still offering you a great deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and ensures we both get a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
