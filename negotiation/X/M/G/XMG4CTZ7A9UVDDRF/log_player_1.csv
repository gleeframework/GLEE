"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but also shows my initial value for the product. I'm aiming to maximize profit, but I'm also mindful of the possibility of selling to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that is significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $12,000. This is the point at which I'd be indifferent between selling to Bob or John. If he rejects, I'll have to weigh my chances of getting a better offer from him against selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$10,500 is a decent price considering the negotiation process and the fact that John is willing to pay $12,000. There's a chance I could get a slightly better offer from Bob in future rounds, but it's not guaranteed and I risk losing the deal entirely. It's best to accept this offer and secure a sale."
