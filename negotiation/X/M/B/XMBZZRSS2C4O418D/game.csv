"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. My next offer is $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and what you're willing to pay.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,100,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my next offer is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
