Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $115, which is a bit above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a higher price, while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is above my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $110. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $108 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm confident that I can get a better price.  We are getting close to the end of the rounds and there is still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $109.  I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 109} 
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $109. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be the final price we agree on, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $107.  While it's slightly below my initial goal, it's still a good deal and ensures a profit.  We are nearing the end of the rounds and further negotiation may lead to a lower price or a deal falling through. It's better to secure a good profit now rather than risk a worse outcome."
