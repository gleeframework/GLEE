"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but I have a clear upper limit of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $750,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but $825,000 is still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating to try and get a better price. There's still room to work with before I have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair offer, considering the value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'll offer you the product for $815000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and we're only $15,000 apart.  At this point, it's probably not worth risking a further rejection. I'm happy to secure the product for $815,000, which is well below my maximum budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John."
