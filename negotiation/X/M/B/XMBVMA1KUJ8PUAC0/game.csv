"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $1000000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $750000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair offer, considering the value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'll offer you the product for $815000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
