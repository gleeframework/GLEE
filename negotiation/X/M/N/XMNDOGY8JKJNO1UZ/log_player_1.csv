"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $60. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It's worth more than $60 to me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $70?  That's a fair jump from my previous offer and would make this a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable selling for $70. It's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair compromise, and it would still be a great value for you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm ready to close this deal if we can agree on a price. How about $75? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Since I've only got a few rounds left, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $100. This ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids further negotiations that might not be fruitful."
