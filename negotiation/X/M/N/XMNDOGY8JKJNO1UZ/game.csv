,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $70?  That's a fair jump from my previous offer and would make this a great deal for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair compromise, and it would still be a great value for you.  Let's make this deal happen!",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm ready to close this deal if we can agree on a price. How about $75? That's the highest I can go.",75.0,Bob,6,
