"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential value to you. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about we settle at $950,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this easy: $1,000,000 even, and we have a deal.  This is my final offer.  I'm confident you'll get even more value than that out of it.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
