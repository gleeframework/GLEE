"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500.  That's still a fair price for the product, and it gives you a good opportunity to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a lower price than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He should aim to get closer to his ideal price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Let's split the difference - $10,000.  That would give us both a good deal, and we can finally finalize this.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $8,000. While he could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000, guaranteeing the lowest possible price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks prolonging the process and potentially not reaching a satisfactory agreement."
