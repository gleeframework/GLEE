# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value I place on the product and the value you place on it. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good deal.  While it's still more than John's price, there's a chance Alice might not budge further, and rejecting could lead to a longer negotiation.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product without risking a prolonged negotiation and potentially missing out on a good opportunity."
