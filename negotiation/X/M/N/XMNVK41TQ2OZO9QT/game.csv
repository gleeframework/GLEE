"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value I place on the product and the value you place on it. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
