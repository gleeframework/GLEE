Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to get a bit more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. It's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer.  Hopefully, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to what I want, and it's better than selling to John for $80. I'll accept his offer."
