"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $11,000 is still more than the product is worth to him ($12,000). It makes sense to reject and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible.  Since he's willing to pay up to $12,000, he should start with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's minimum price ($10,000) to see if she's willing to negotiate. This offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. He's still better off than buying from John, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price, but he wants to be reasonable and show that he's willing to compromise.  This offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer, and it's closer to the middle ground between their desired prices. This could encourage Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still a significant amount over what he'd like to pay. He should continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.  He's still better off than buying from John, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price, but he's still trying to save as much money as possible. This offer is a compromise, slightly higher than his last offer, but still lower than Alice's current price. It's a reasonable move that shows Bob is willing to negotiate, but also signals that he's approaching his limit.  This could potentially encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,900 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $12,000. While it would be ideal to get a lower price, it's getting risky to keep rejecting and counter-offering. 

* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a chance Alice might get frustrated and refuse to negotiate further.
* **Time pressure:**  They're nearing the end of the 10 rounds, and it's likely they won't get a better offer from Alice.

Accepting the offer at this point ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
