"Hi Alice, thanks for offering. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $13,000 is still above my budget. Could you consider $9,500? I believe that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm trying to stay under $10,000. How about $10,000 even?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,6,
