"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's valuation as possible, while still leaving some room for negotiation.  A counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and may encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's target price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  There are still several rounds left and Bob could potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying below his target price of $10,500. This approach aims to show Alice that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but is not willing to overpay. The higher offer might also encourage Alice to accept, especially if she sees the potential for a quick deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for a price that is higher than Bob's target price.  There are still 5 rounds left, so Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.  It is possible that Alice may be more willing to lower her price as the rounds progress and the possibility of not selling the product increases."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his offer to $11,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet her halfway.  The offer is still below Alice's last offer, but it is getting closer to her desired price. This approach could encourage Alice to accept the offer or at least make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,800 is still above Bob's target price and only 3 rounds remain. The likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds is low.  Considering that John is willing to sell for $12,000, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John to avoid further negotiations and secure the product within his budget."
