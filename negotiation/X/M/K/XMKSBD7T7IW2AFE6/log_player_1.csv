Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, giving you a good profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation and a potential deal that benefits both parties.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** This price opens the conversation and provides a starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $12,000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is more than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a price between $9,000 and $12,000 to try and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,500 for the product. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one. How about $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is not my ideal price, it's a good compromise that's only $250 away from my counteroffer and a significant improvement over selling to John. It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to more back-and-forth, and I'm happy to secure a deal that's close to my target."
