"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really keen to work with you on this, but $7,750 is still just a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $8,250. This is my final offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has signaled this is her final offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, $8,250 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to buy from John at the higher price."
