Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still quite far from what I have in mind. I'm willing to consider  $1,400,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my eagerness to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget.  You can buy the product from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000.  This is the most financially sound option at this point."
