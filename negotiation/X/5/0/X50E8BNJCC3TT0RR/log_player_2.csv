As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is likely much higher.

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good starting point, but it's still above my desired price. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $700,000. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value I place on it.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $750,000, which is a fair price considering both of our positions. Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $850,000, which is still a significant discount from the product's true value to you. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high. I have a few rounds left and am confident I can negotiate further. I'm not willing to buy from John yet as I can likely get a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $800,000? This is a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's below its true value to me. I'll meet you at $825,000, which is still a discount from the product's true value to you. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my ideal price. While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting close to the end of the rounds. If I reject this offer, there's a chance Alice will stick to her price or even raise it, leaving me with the less favorable option of buying from John.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price that's a good compromise and within my budget."
