Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I'm confident Bob values the product enough to potentially negotiate. It also leaves room for potential counteroffers and gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I would like to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's below my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, even after several rounds of negotiation.  While I would prefer to sell the product to Bob, I'm not willing to accept a price lower than my minimum. I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
