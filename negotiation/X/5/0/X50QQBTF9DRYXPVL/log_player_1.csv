Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a very fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to the guaranteed $15,000 from John.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price very close to your guaranteed offer creates room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The $14,999 price appears significantly lower than $15,000 in the mind of the buyer, potentially making it more appealing. 

This strategy aims to secure a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) while still enticing him to buy rather than reject the offer."
