Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. It's a unique item that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know the product's value to Bob ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), I want to start high to maximize potential profit.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  The $14,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control and potentially leading to a sale above my minimum.
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John at my desired minimum. This knowledge allows me to be more confident in my initial high offer."
