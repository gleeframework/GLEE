You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Even though you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. This saves you $300,000.
* **You still get a good deal:**  You value the product at $1,500,000, and you can get it for $1,200,000, which is a good deal."
