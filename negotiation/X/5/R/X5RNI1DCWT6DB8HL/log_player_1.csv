Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value, you leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay. He might:
    * Accept immediately, indicating he values it even higher.
    * Counter-offer, giving you a better understanding of his price range.
    * Reject outright, at which point you have the safety net of John's offer. 
* **""Pre-Listing"" Tactic:**  Creating a sense of exclusivity and urgency can sometimes encourage buyers to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
