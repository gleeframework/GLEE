"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $900,000. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely negotiate a better price than $900,000. While it's already a good deal, aiming lower is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer helps establish a baseline for negotiation.  It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it leaves room for us to gradually increase our offer while aiming for a price well below her starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is a good sign.  We're still aiming to pay closer to $700,000, so it's worth another counter-offer. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 775000} 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount.  It's a substantial jump from our previous offer, signaling that we're getting closer to a price we're willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $837,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close, but every bit counts! Alice is sticking to a pattern of halving the difference.  It's worth another counter-offer to see if we can nudge the price down a bit further before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I could make this work for $800,000.  It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to finalize the deal today if you're agreeable."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**  This offer splits the difference again, keeping the negotiation moving, but now we're getting to a price that's a very good deal for us. By expressing a willingness to close quickly, we're adding a bit of incentive for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly committed to this back-and-forth pattern of splitting the difference. While we could likely push for another round or two, the potential savings are minimal at this point.  $825,000 is already a fantastic price, well below our initial goals and significantly less than John's offer. It's time to secure a win and accept the deal!"
