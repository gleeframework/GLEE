"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential return will be well worth it. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is there any flexibility in your pricing?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1200000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  How about $1350000? This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it still offers you a substantial opportunity.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the concession, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1275000? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. I understand your position, but $1275000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential this product offers.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000, but I can do $1290000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the potential of the product.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
