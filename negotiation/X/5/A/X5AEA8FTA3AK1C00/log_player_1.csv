Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential return will be well worth it. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is there any flexibility in your pricing? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  How about $1,350,000? This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it still offers you a substantial opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the concession, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1275000? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,275,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. I understand your position, but $1,275,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential this product offers."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000, but I can do $1290000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,290,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, and it shows that Bob is serious about acquiring the product. It's better to secure the deal now than to risk further negotiations and potentially lose the sale."
