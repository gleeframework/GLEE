Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. What are your thoughts?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500. How about we settle on $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is slightly below your target price of $15,000.** This means you'll be saving some money compared to buying from John.
* **Alice stated this is her final offer.**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **You have 5 rounds remaining.** This gives you some room to potentially make a counteroffer if you really want to try and get a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal is higher.

**Considering the factors above, accepting Alice's offer is the most reasonable option to secure the product while still achieving a decent saving.**"
