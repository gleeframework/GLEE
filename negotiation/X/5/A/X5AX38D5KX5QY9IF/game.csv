"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $19,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, $19,000 is still outside my budget. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $9,500 is still a significant gap from where I see this product's value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which I believe is a fair offer reflecting the benefits you'll gain.",17000.0,Alice,5,
