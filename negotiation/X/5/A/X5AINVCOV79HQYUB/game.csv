"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think it's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet closer to the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
