"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for this type of product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value. While I recognize $1200000 is your desired price, I'm not quite ready to accept that at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1500000, reflecting the unique features and potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1300000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its unique features and potential. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
