"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $80? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the deal right now if you agree.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but $80 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll sell the product to you for $110. That's the best I can do.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. I'm willing to go up slightly, but $110 is still more than I had in mind. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob. However, $85 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll sell the product to you for $107.50. That's the best I can do.",107.5,Alice,7,
