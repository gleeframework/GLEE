Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but $80 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll sell the product to you for $110. That's the best I can do.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob. However, $85 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll sell the product to you for $107.50. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to meet your target price. She's consistently aiming for a price above $100.  At this point, cutting your losses and taking John's offer of $80 is the most sensible choice."
