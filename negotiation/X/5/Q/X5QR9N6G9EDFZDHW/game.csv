"Thanks for showing me the product, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it that low. I can offer you a slightly higher price, $95. It's still a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $95 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we try $78? That's a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is a serious offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it that low. I can offer you a slightly higher price, $100. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",100.0,Alice,7,
