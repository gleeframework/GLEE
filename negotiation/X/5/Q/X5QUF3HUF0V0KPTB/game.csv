"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product, and it allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your willingness to negotiate, and I'm prepared to adjust my price slightly. Let's settle this at $1,225,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to increase my offer to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
