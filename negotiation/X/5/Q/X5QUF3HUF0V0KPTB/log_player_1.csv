Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product, and it allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.
