"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation.  Selling to John right now would be a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1090000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to John's price, I'm still hesitant to sell to him. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially since he is willing to keep negotiating.  The risk of selling to John for a lower price outweighs the slight chance of a successful counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price. While I understand your position, $1,090,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,110,000. This price acknowledges your needs while allowing me to reach a reasonable outcome.  It's time to be realistic about the value of this product, and I believe this offer reflects that."", ""product_price"": 1110000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now lower than John's price. The negotiation has reached a stalemate, and continuing is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  Selling to John ensures I secure a guaranteed income, even if it's lower than my initial goal. The risk of further negotiation and potential rejection is too high at this point."
