"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This price still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price. While I understand your position, $1090000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1110000. This price acknowledges your needs while allowing me to reach a reasonable outcome.  It's time to be realistic about the value of this product, and I believe this offer reflects that.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
