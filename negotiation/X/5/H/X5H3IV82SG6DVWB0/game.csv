"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price, considering its value, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  $8,250 is closer, but it's still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $8,750. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I'm not going any higher than that. Can you accept this price?",8500.0,Bob,8,
