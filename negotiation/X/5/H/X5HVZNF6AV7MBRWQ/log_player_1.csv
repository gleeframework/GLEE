}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $900,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a 50% discount. I'll counter with a price closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your desire to find a fair price, the value of this product is substantial and non-negotiable to that degree.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still below my acceptable range. I'll counter offer again to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects a significant reduction on my end."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose a slight concession: I'll pay the full $1,200,000, but I'd like you to throw in some additional support or services to sweeten the deal. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I appreciate Bob's attempt to find a creative solution, adding additional support or services isn't something I'm prepared to do.  My focus is on the value of the product itself, and I'm standing firm on my last offer.  I need to see him move closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for additional value.  However, I believe my final offer of $1,350,000 represents a fair price for the product's inherent worth. I'm firm on this number. If you're unable to meet it, I may need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

This response aims to:

* **Reiterate firmness:** I'm making it clear that the previous offer of $1,350,000 is non-negotiable.
* **Introduce a sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly implies that I might sell to John if Bob doesn't agree. This could push him to accept my final offer."
