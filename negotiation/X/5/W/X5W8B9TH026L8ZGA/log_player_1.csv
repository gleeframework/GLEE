I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  We're getting close to my desired price, but the negotiation with Bob is taking too long and it's becoming clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk losing more time and money trying to negotiate with Bob."
