"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a great deal to you, and I'm prepared to offer it at a competitive price. I'm asking $1,750,000.  It's a significant value proposition, and I believe it aligns with your estimated worth. Let's discuss further.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the value this product offers.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,575,000?  I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",1575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,575,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,350,000? I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget constraints.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $1,350,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm prepared to go down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute bottom line.  This price reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this point. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, so how about $1,725,000? I think this is a fair compromise that balances your value proposition with my budget constraints.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
