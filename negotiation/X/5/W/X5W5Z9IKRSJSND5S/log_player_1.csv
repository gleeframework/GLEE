Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need at least $800,000 to make this worthwhile.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation space:** This gives us a potential negotiation space of $700,000. 
* **Compromise:** Offering $1,200,000 is a good compromise, significantly more than my minimum and still well within Bob's budget.

This offer gives me a strong chance of getting a better price than selling to John, while still being attractive to Bob."
