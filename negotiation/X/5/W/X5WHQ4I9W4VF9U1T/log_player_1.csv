Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and see if it's close enough to my target, or if I need to negotiate further.  If things drag on, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low.  While I'm not happy with the initial rejection, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still well above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation.  I hope Bob will see that this is a fair price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob is not budging, and his offers are far too low. I'm not willing to continue this negotiation any further. I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and move on."
