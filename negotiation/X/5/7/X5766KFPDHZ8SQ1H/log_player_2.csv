"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is a bit high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $700,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  However, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,000,000. This still reflects a considerable discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but that price remains outside my budget.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need us to find a more realistic middle ground. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about finding a solution, and I appreciate that. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a substantial difference for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. How about $950,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go below $950,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it's in your best interest to take that deal and save the $150,000."
