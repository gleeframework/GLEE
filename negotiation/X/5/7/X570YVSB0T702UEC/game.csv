"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Could we work something closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price range. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
