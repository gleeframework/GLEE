"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $115 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $125, so I'll offer $120. Would you be willing to accept that price?",120.0,Bob,6,
