"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I can justify right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  If you're serious about selling, let's see if we can find a compromise there.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. How about we meet at $14,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
