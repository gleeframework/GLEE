"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

While $13,000 is a better offer than Alice's original price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target of $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. How about we meet at $14,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice is unwilling to budge much further, and Bob is getting closer to his limit. It's now more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $10,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially paying more."
