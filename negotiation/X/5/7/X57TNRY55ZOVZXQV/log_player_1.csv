{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $11,500 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures that you are still making a profit, and it gives you room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, which could make Bob walk away, but it's also not too low, which could make you feel like you're giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than your minimum.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Make a counteroffer:** You can try to meet somewhere in the middle, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer.
* **See if Bob is willing to negotiate further:** Bob's initial rejection might just be a tactic to get a lower price. A counteroffer can gauge his true interest.
* **Keep the option to sell to John open:**  You still have the $12,000 safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still holding on to a decent profit margin.
* **Mid-point:** $10,500 is a reasonable midpoint between your last offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain value:** The price is still above Bob's maximum value, giving you leverage if he wants to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Could you do $9,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still a bit lower than you'd like. Rejecting the offer allows you to:

* **Negotiate further:** You can make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap.
* **Gauge Bob's true limits:** By rejecting this offer, you're testing his willingness to go higher.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  Having the $12,000 backup keeps you in a strong negotiating position.

If Bob is truly interested, you have a good chance of closing the deal at a price closer to your minimum, which is still profitable for you."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,500 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to go a little lower to make this work.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from your previous offer, demonstrating your desire to close the deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $10,000 is a good compromise point, halfway between your last offer and Bob's latest offer.
* **Maintain Profitability:**  $10,000 is still above your minimum, ensuring you make a profit while maximizing your chances of reaching an agreement. 

This counteroffer is designed to incentivize Bob to accept, as it's a reasonable compromise that benefits both parties."
