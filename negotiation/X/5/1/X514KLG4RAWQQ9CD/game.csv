,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go up to $875,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $912,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $890,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. My revised offer is $915,000. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept and still make a profit, considering the product's value to you.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay a fair price.  But $915,000 is still too high. Let's split the difference - $902,500. This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal today.",902500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one last concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $902,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $915,000 and $902,500, which would be $908,750. This is the lowest price I can accept and still make a profit, considering the product's value to you.",908750.0,Alice,9,
