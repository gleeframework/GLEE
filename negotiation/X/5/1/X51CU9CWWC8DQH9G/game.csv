"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $16,000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However,  $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
