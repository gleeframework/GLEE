"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but not so high as to be immediately rejected.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromises in future rounds.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for better negotiation:** I have 8 rounds remaining and can likely get a better price by continuing negotiations.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I have the backup option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $16,000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $18,000 but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Motivating Bob:**  The message emphasizes that $16,000 is a fair price for both parties. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I am still in a strong negotiating position, as I have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However,  $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, I believe I can still get a better deal.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I can try to push for a higher price.
* **Backup option:** I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Final offer:**  I'm making it clear that $15,000 is my absolute bottom line, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Strong position:** I'm still in a strong position, as I can sell to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't accept."
