Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a compromise between your minimum desired price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000).  It gives Bob a reasonable discount while still allowing you to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your minimum desired price.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to your minimum desired price than his previous offer, and it's still a reasonable deal for him.  Accepting his offer ensures you sell the product and avoid the risk of continuing negotiations that might ultimately lead to a lower price or a sale to John at your minimum price."
