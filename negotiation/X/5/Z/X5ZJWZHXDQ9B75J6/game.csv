"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $8,250. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
