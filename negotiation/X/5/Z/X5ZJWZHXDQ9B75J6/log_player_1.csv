Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my $8,000 target. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $8,250. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000.  I'd rather not risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a sale, so I'll accept his offer."
