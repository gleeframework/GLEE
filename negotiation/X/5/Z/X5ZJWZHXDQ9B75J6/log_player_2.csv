"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. It's likely to be rejected, but it establishes Bob's lower price point and opens the negotiation. It also shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal.  There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $8,250. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price of $8,000. This counteroffer is only $250 above his maximum. It shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal."
