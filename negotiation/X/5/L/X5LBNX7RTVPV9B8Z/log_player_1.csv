Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth every penny! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by presenting the highest price you're willing to accept. This will hopefully encourage Bob to counteroffer, giving you a chance to bargain and find a price that works for both of you.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be ready to respond to his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential of selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiating, I won't accept anything below my floor.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
