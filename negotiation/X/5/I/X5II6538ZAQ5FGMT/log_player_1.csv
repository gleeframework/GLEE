Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to me. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $1,500,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $1,500,000. Let's see if he accepts or makes a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I don't think $900,000 is a good deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send Bob a new offer that's higher than his previous one, but lower than the minimum value I'm willing to accept:
