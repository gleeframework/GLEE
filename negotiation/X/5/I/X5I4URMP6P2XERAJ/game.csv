"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my minimum.  How about $12,000?  That's still a great price for such a valuable product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
