Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging tone can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is set to leave room for some back and forth, allowing for potential counteroffers.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  This offer also implicitly emphasizes the value of the product by reminding Bob of the opportunity cost of not accepting (he might miss out on a good deal)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price before considering selling to John.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain some negotiating leverage and potentially get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $1,100,000. The value of this product justifies a slightly higher price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Reasoning:**  I'm explaining to Bob why I'm rejecting his offer,  using the ""value"" argument to justify a higher price.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better price.
* **Focus on Benefits:**  I'm highlighting the ""benefits"" Bob will receive from owning the product to further incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to increase my offer beyond $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  I'm concerned that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a lengthy process and potentially lower my final price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a substantial profit.
* **Time and Effort:** Selling to John saves me the time and energy involved in continued negotiation with Bob."
