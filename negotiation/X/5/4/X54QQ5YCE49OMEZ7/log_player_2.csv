It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and go with John. Here's why:

* **Stalled Progress:**  Alice is conceding very small amounts with each round. It's unlikely she'll reach a price close to your $10,600 offer.
* **Time Limit:**  You're down to the final rounds. Continuing with Alice risks a failed negotiation, forcing you to accept John's $15,000 price anyway.
* **Known Alternative:** John offers a guaranteed price of $15,000. While not ideal, it's better to secure that price now than risk ending up with nothing."
