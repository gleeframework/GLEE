"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price ($800,000).**  
* **There are still 9 rounds left.** I have time to negotiate and potentially get a higher price. 
* **Selling to John right now would be a loss.**  While it's a guaranteed deal, it's not worth losing potential profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  I believe this price still represents a great value for you, given the potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

* **We're getting closer, but there's still room for negotiation.**  I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** There are only two rounds left. 
* **Bob's offer is still below my desired minimum price of $800,000.**  I don't have enough time to continue negotiating and risk getting a lower offer or losing the deal completely.
