"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be a game-changer for your business.  Considering its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1200000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  I believe this price still represents a great value for you, given the potential of this product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1075000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1025000, which represents a significant investment on my end.  This offer shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1025000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to stay above $1040000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference and go with $1032500. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1032500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  While $1032500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to go up to $1020000,  which is a very fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and both walk away happy.",1020000.0,Bob,8,
