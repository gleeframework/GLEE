Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  It's a great deal for something you'll gain significant value from."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting high allows me to potentially get the best possible price from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, there's a good chance we can settle on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm not pressured to go below $10,000 because I have John as a guaranteed buyer. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price."
