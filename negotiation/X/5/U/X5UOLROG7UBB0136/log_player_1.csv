"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price. Accepting ensures a sure sale and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
