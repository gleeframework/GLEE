"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $9,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  How about we split the difference at $9,400 and call it a deal?",9400.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $9,400, which would be $9,600. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",9600.0,Alice,7,
