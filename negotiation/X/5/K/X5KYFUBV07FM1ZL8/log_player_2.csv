Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90. I can offer it to you for $100, but that's as close as I can get to meeting you in the middle.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price close enough to your $80 walk-away point within the remaining rounds. You've already reached Round 7, and she's still at $100.  It's time to secure the product at your target price from John."
