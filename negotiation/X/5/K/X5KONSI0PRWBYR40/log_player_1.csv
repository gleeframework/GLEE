"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold strategy, but I believe it sets a strong baseline and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the remaining rounds.  It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's too early to give in. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000.  This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for profit. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $8,000, as we're running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $6,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I'm starting to run out of time, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping we can reach a compromise, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $8,500. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize that I'm serious about selling the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $8,000, as we're down to five rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $8,000. We have four rounds left, and I'm hoping to close the deal at a price that reflects the value of the product. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. However, if he rejects my next counteroffer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm lowering my price to $8,200. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize that I'm serious about selling the product. We only have three rounds left, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. If he rejects this offer, I'll probably sell to John for $8,000 to avoid losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to two rounds left, and Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I've made significant compromises, but I'm not sure if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. Rather than risk losing the deal completely with another rejected counteroffer, I'm going to sell to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't end up with nothing."
