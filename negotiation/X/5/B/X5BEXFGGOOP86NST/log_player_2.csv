"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is within his budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $90 for the product. This is still a reasonable price for Alice, as it's above her value of $80. However, it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's target, it's still slightly above Alice's estimated value for the product. Since Bob has 7 rounds left and has shown Alice he's willing to negotiate, there's still potential for a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering $92, which is a slight increase from his previous offer of $90. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying below Alice's current offer of $95. It also signals to Alice that Bob is serious about closing the deal but is not willing to go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $98 is still higher than Bob's target price and even higher than his last counteroffer. While Bob has fewer rounds left, he's shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice is clearly willing to compromise. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 94}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering $94, a middle ground between his last offer of $92 and Alice's current offer of $98. This shows Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway while still trying to keep the price below $95. With only 4 rounds left, this is a crucial step to potentially reach a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation is getting tight. Alice's offer of $99 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $120. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will accept his next counteroffer. It's a high risk with limited time. Buying from John for $120 guarantees Bob gets the product, although it's the most expensive option. With the time constraint and uncertainty, it's a more practical decision to secure the product now rather than risk losing it to a failed negotiation."
