"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, $900,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I know the product is worth $800,000 to him, so there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to get closer to $800,000 with further negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm offering $825,000. It's a slight increase from Bob's last offer and a little lower than my previous counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's tempting to accept, as it's getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further. I'm still not ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 810000}
```

I'm offering $810,000. It's a compromise again, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping this is enough to close the deal and avoid selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. With only two rounds left, it's unlikely Bob will offer more than $795,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I'm running out of time and John's offer guarantees me my minimum price."
