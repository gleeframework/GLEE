Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $14,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value, making Bob less likely to counter with a lowball offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving the door open for counter-offers.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he doesn't know John is willing to pay that. This gives Alice some bargaining power.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of selling it for $14,000 is worth the calculated risk."
