"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that $60 is low, but $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to negotiating, but $90 is still too low for me.  Let's meet at $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the value.",100.0,Alice,5,
