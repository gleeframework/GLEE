"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me leverage. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** While I haven't disclosed details about the product, I'm emphasizing its ""fantastic opportunity"" and ""worth every penny"" to pique Bob's interest. 

This strategy sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation where I can adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I believe I can secure a better deal with continued negotiation.  Selling to John would only net me my minimum, but I feel there's room for a more profitable outcome with Bob. 

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** I'm firm on my minimum acceptable price, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000, which is still a significant profit for me but also shows flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential for a good deal.
* **Building Common Ground:**  I'm using language like ""let's find common ground"" to encourage further negotiation.

This strategy aims to push Bob closer to my minimum while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1100000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum.  Selling to John would guarantee me $1,200,000, which is a safer option.  However, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a more favorable price.

I will counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find common ground. However, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000, which is right in the middle of our previous offers. This shows a willingness to compromise while still exceeding my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Finality:** I'm using language like ""finalise this deal"" to suggest that this is a good opportunity for both of us to close the deal.

This strategy aims to pressure Bob into accepting the offer while still staying above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and guarantees me a profit.  While I would prefer to earn more, the negotiation has reached a point where further rounds might not yield a significantly higher price.  There's also the risk that Bob might become unwilling to negotiate further or walk away entirely. 

Accepting his offer secures a safe and acceptable deal, preventing potential loss and minimizing the risk of missing out on this opportunity."
