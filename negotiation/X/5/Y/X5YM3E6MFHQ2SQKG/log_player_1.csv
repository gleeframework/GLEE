"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more to me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high sets a strong initial position and allows for potential negotiation room. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the product's higher value to me emphasizes the potential win for Bob.
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  Framing it as a win-win situation makes Bob more receptive to negotiating. 
* **Flexibility:**  While $2,000,000 is ambitious, I'm prepared to negotiate and have a backup option in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John is a safe alternative:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired value. 
* **Negotiation room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a better price, but I'm not risking dropping too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,200,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,700,000. This would still provide a good profit margin for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Fair Price:**  I'm framing it as a fair price, emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John offers a safe alternative:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired value. 
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I want to maximize my chances of getting closer to my target price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to $1,500,000, aiming to find a compromise with Bob without jeopardizing my financial goals.  I'm prepared to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,400,000 still falls short of my minimum. Given the product's value and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, but I'm not giving in too much.
* **Target Price:** I'm getting closer to my desired price while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I frame it as a fair outcome for both of us, encouraging Bob to consider it.

**Next Steps:**

I'm prepared to accept Bob's offer if he raises his price a bit, but I'm also ready to sell to John if this round doesn't lead to an agreement.  I'm strategically moving closer to my desired price while maintaining the possibility of a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can't agree on this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Rounds:** We've reached Round 6, and further negotiation with Bob might not yield a better outcome. 
* **John offers a safe alternative:** Selling to John guarantees my desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Final Decision:**

The time is running out, and I want to ensure I get my minimum desired price.  Selling to John is the safest and most reliable option at this point."
