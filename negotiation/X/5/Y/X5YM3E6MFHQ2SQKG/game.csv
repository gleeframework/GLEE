"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more to me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,200,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,700,000. This would still provide a good profit margin for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,400,000 still falls short of my minimum. Given the product's value and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can't agree on this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
