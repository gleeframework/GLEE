"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $1,500,000 is a strong starting point, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I'm confident this revised offer reflects a fair deal for both of us.
