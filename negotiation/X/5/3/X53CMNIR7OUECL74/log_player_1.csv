Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $13,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $15,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $13,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning listing it ""publicly,"" I create a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to find a price point where Bob feels like he's getting a deal while still maximizing my potential profit."
