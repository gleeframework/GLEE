"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay $10,000 for the product from John, and Alice's offer is also $10,000, there's no advantage to buying from Alice.  You might as well buy from John."
