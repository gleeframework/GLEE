Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** He's willing to pay $150, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Bob knows exactly what you're asking for.

This strategy allows you to potentially earn a good profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:** $120 is better than $100, but you can likely do better.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay more than $100, so you can potentially get closer to your desired price of $130.
* **You can increase your chances of a better outcome:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you demonstrate that you're not desperate for a sale and could potentially push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go as low as $122? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:** $122 is only $3 below your initial offer of $125. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While you could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further. It's likely you've reached a point where the price difference is minimal.
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John for $100 would mean losing $22 compared to accepting Bob's offer.  

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum and provides a relatively quick and low-risk outcome."
