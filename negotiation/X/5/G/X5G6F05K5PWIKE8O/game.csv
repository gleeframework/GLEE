"Alice, your product is of interest to me, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I can see us reaching a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $1,275,000.  I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're nearing a deal.  $1,275,000 isn't ideal for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 if it clinches the deal today.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $1,285,000.  That's a significant compromise from my last offer, and I truly believe this is a price we can both be happy with.",1285000.0,Bob,6,
