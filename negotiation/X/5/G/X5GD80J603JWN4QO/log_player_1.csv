Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, but it also shows that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that far down. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price from $175 to $125. This shows a willingness to negotiate but still keeps the price above what I know Bob is willing to pay. Hopefully, this will lead to a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $115 is still lower than what I initially hoped for, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price than John's offer.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, potentially ending up with no deal at all."
