"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I've considered its value to you and believe a price of $1,200,000 would be fair to both of us. This price allows for a healthy profit margin for you, while still ensuring I achieve a significant return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping we could come to a better agreement. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value to me, but it's a bit more reasonable for my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product.  To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment, while still providing you with a valuable asset at a reasonable cost.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To make this work for both of us, I'm proposing a final price of $1,075,000. This represents a compromise from my previous offer, and it's a price that I believe reflects the true value of this product. This allows me to cover my costs and still secure a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,030,000 for the product. This price is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
