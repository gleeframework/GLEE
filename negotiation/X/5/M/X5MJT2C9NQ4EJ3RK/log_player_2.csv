Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000, saving you $1,250 compared to Alice's final offer."
