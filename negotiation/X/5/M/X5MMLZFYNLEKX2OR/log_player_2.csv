Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $1,000,000? This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice has met John's price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate as it's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and we know John is offering a sure thing."
