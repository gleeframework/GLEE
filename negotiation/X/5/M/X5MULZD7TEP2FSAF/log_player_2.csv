"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We're aiming for below $1,200,000 and Alice's opening offer is too high. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer gives us more room to negotiate upwards while still aiming to stay below our $1,200,000 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our maximum budget. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and we risk losing the deal. Accepting now secures the product at the best possible price."
