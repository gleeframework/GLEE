Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it's not so high that it's unreasonable. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but thinks the price is too high.  If Bob rejects, you can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000."
