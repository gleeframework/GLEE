"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm thinking of a price of $180 for it. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $130. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. If that works for you, we can close the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $145 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob! I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $152?",152.0,Alice,7,
