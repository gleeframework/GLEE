Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and I'll be ready to negotiate from there.  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further or if I should go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,300,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's still above my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap. I want to see if I can push him a bit closer to my initial offer. I'm confident that a counteroffer will keep the negotiation going and potentially lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $1,300,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
