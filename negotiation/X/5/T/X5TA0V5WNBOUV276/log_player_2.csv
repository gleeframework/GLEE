**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $9,500, while John wants $10,000.
* **You still save money:**  Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, you're getting it for $9,500, which is still less than your maximum budget of $10,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money while still acquiring the product."
