{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $14,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes fairness to build rapport and encourage negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a slightly higher price, I aim to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  There's room for negotiation without risking losing the deal immediately.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate how willing he is to negotiate and potentially pay more.

If Bob rejects, I will observe his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the option of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While he is willing to negotiate, his offer is still too low.  I need to maintain my position and try to get a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I will consider the following:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I won't go below $15,000.
* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:** His initial rejection and counteroffer suggest he might be open to a higher price, but I need to gauge his limits.
* **The option of selling to John:**  If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go below $13,000.  This price still gives you a good value and leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $13,000. This is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal, but firmly state my minimum price. I emphasize that $13,000 is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain my position:**  It shows that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Bob's willingness to compromise:**  If he rejects this offer, it will give me a better understanding of his true price limit.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  By offering a compromise, I show I'm serious about making a deal, but not at the expense of my own financial interests. 

I am still open to further negotiation, but I will be careful not to go below my minimum acceptable price. If Bob continues to offer prices that are too low, I will not hesitate to accept John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still a bit too low. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially considering I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I will consider:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I won't go below $15,000.
* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:**  His gradual increase in offer suggests he might be willing to go a little higher. 
* **The option of selling to John:**  If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome, I will accept John's offer of $15,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I aim to keep the negotiation open and explore the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement closer to my desired price."

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $13,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial offer and significantly lower than John's offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain my position:** This counteroffer shows that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my desired range.
* **Gauge Bob's willingness to compromise:** His response will reveal how much higher he's willing to go.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** By offering a compromise, I demonstrate my seriousness in reaching an agreement while ensuring a fair deal for myself.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, it's clear that we are too far apart in our desired prices.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a successful outcome, and I don't want to risk losing time and potentially missing out on a better deal.

**Decision:**

Therefore, I've decided to accept John's offer of $15,000.  This is the best option for me at this point, as it guarantees me my minimum desired price and saves me from further negotiations that may not be fruitful."
