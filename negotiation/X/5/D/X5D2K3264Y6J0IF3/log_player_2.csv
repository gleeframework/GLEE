Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a considerable offer, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get the price even lower. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my budget, but still a bit above my maximum acceptable price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I hope we can meet on this price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
