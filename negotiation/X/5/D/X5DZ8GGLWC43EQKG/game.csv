"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1200000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must inform you that $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product's unique features and value. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $950000.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not convinced that $1025000 is the right price for this product. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product's unique features and value. I'm counteroffering at $1075000.

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to make one last attempt to negotiate, but I'm afraid I've already made significant concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1075000. I'm starting to feel that we're at an impasse, and I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm going to make one final offer, and I'm willing to meet you at $1075000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,9,
