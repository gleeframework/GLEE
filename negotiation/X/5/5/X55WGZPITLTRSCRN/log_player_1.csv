Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $900,000 is less than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, allowing you to potentially negotiate a higher price. 
* **Is within Bob's acceptable range:**  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, $900,000 is a price he might be willing to pay. 
* **Keeps the deal alive:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell the product to John for $1,000,000, ensuring you don't lose out on the opportunity to make a profit.

Let's see if Bob bites!"
