"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is still too high for my budget. How about we settle around $725,000?  That feels like a reasonable compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're right, Alice, we are getting close! I'm willing to budge a bit more as well. How about $750,000?  That's a fair offer considering the value and our previous discussions.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. I can offer it to you for $775,000, but I need you to meet me at that price. It's the lowest I can go.",775000.0,Alice,7,
