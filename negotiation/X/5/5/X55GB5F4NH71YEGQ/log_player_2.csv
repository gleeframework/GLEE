"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my target.  I want to appear interested in the product, but not desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $7,500. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $7,500 is still higher than John's price.  I'll reject and counter, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. How about $6,750?"",
""product_price"": 6750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm splitting the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $6,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200. Let's see if we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is slowly coming down, but I'm still above John's price. I need to push a little harder to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm ready to make a deal today, but I need you to come down a little more.  Would you consider $6,900?"",
""product_price"": 6900
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm nudging my offer up slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming to stay under $7,000.  Adding a sense of urgency might help push the negotiation forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $7,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $7,000. This is a good deal, saving me $1,000 from John's price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and I don't want to risk her walking away from the negotiation."
