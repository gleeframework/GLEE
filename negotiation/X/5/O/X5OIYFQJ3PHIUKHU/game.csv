"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still a good price for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",8000.0,Alice,3,
