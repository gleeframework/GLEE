"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $950000, which is still a significant discount from the product's true value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and the extras I'm offering.",950000.0,Alice,5,
