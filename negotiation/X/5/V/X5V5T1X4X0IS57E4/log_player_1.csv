{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal. While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $10,500 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,200?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. We're not in a desperate situation yet, so it's worth pushing a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a solution. How about we settle at $11,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're now getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation. Offering $11,000 makes it clear we're willing to compromise but also sets a firm boundary. By stating it's our final offer, we add a sense of urgency for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly trying to get the best possible deal, and $10,900 is a reasonable compromise.  While we could hold out for $11,000, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
