{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so the offer must be significantly higher to be worthwhile.

This offer aims to secure a substantial profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept."
