Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($150) at $145 creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.  It's a price that's likely to be tempting while still yielding a higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested but finds $145 a bit too high."
