"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to buy the product for $10500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to offer the product to you for $10800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference - how about $10600?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget.  What do you say?",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $10600 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $10700.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10700.0,Alice,5,
