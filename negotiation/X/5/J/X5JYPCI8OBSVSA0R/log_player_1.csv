Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first since I believe you would find great value in it. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a higher price ($19,000) allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Bob is likely to negotiate, and the initial high price gives you space to come down if needed. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By framing the offer as a special opportunity for Bob, you might nudge him towards accepting a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims for the best possible outcome, but there's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. You have a strong fallback option with John, ensuring you don't lose out entirely."
