"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings you will be worth it. This is a unique offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay $1,500,000. So, consider this a chance to secure the product at a lower price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
