"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, considering it's significantly more than the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. It acknowledges Alice's offer while still leaving significant room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit above her perceived value of the product. There's room for further negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

We're splitting the difference here to try and find a mutually agreeable price point quickly.  This keeps the negotiation moving and maintains a price point significantly below John's offer."
