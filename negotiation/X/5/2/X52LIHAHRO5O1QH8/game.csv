"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $130? It's still a good price for you, and I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $130 is still a bit steep for me. How about $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $115 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about $118?",118.0,Bob,6,
