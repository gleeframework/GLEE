"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to settle at $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll offer you a revised price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my original asking price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
