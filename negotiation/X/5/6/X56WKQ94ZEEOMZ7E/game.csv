"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $102 is the lowest I can go. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",102.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a serious lowball offer of $85. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider buying from John.",85.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $85. It's below my minimum price and doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $110 is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me here, I'll consider it.",110.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I've made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'll offer $90, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll buy the product from John for $100.",90.0,Bob,10,
