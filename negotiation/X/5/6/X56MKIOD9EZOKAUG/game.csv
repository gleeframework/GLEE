"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. Is this something you'd be interested in?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $92.50. This is my final offer for now.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on buying this product, so how about $87.50? It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you at $90, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $88.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can meet you at $89, but I'm not sure how much lower I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",89.0,Alice,7,
