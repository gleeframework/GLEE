Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $119 leaves room for potential negotiation (if Bob counter-offers) while still being very close to your guaranteed price. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is straightforward and focuses on the product and the price. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't want to engage in multiple rounds of back-and-forth negotiation with Bob. If you had more time and wanted to potentially get even more than $119, you could start with a higher price and see how Bob responds."
