Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $110 is still more than $80, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $110 is more than your minimum of $120, so you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for some back-and-forth to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm really interested in your product, but I'm on a budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still not quite there.  At this point,  I'm  not willing to negotiate further.  John is offering me my minimum, and it's clear that Bob isn't going to meet my price expectations. Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John."
