"Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm really interested in your product, but I'm on a budget.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",100.0,Bob,4,
