Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is a price that allows us to make a significant profit while still potentially being attractive to Bob. It's a price that suggests some room for negotiation but also conveys the value of the product.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net with John, who is willing to pay our minimum acceptable price. This allows us to be a bit bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
