"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've stated, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're close to a deal, but $11,800 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,200.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit. Let's finalize this now.",12200.0,Alice,5,
