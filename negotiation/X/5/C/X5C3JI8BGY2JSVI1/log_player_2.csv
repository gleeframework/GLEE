"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a lower offer that benefits me more, but is still reasonably above Alice's perceived value of the product. This leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still closer to her desired price. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that the product has value, Alice, but I have a budget in mind. Could we make it work for $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to her price, showing willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a lower point than her current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further. $8,250 is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice says it's her final offer, but there's still some room for negotiation.  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer before considering John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000 even?  That's a price I can feel good about."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer serves a few purposes:

* **Meeting in the middle:** It directly addresses her ""final offer"" by proposing a compromise that seems fair. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** $8,000 is a clean, round number that feels more significant and might be more appealing than dealing in $250 increments.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By implying this is a price I can ""feel good about,"" it subtly suggests this might be my last offer before considering alternatives."
