,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $60 is quite low for the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $70? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $70.  Would you be willing to do $85? That's my final offer.",85.0,Alice,5,
