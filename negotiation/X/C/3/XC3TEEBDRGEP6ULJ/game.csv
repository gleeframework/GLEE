,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion. While I appreciate your offer, $10,375 is still slightly lower than what I need.  How about we meet in the middle again and go with $10,562.50?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",10562.5,Alice,5,
