"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low considering the significant value this product holds.
