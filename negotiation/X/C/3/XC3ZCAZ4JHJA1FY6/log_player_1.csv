Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing us closer to our ideal outcome.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob has no knowledge of John's offer. If Bob knew about John, he would have no incentive to pay more than $1,200,000.
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, with a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, we're not losing money if he declines."
