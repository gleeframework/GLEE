"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  It's important to start strong and see where Bob's willingness to pay lies."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for that just yet.  There are 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get a higher price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get a profit.  My goal is to find a price that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  We have several rounds remaining, and I believe we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,300,000.  Bob seems unwilling to budge much, and I want to show some flexibility to keep the negotiation moving forward.  I'm still holding out for a price that's a bit higher than his last offer, but I'm recognizing that we need to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to try for a slightly higher price.  With just 4 rounds left, I need to be careful, but I don't want to settle for too little.  I'll see if we can find a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1280000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,280,000. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I need to make a move.  I'm confident that Bob is serious about buying the product, and this offer is a good compromise. It's a substantial increase from his last offer, but still below my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting down to the wire, and there are only two rounds remaining.  Bob hasn't shown a willingness to go much higher, and I'm not sure I can get a better price in the next round.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm going to sell to John. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 than risk getting nothing in the final two rounds."
