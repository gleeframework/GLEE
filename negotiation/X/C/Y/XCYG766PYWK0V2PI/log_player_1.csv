Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could meet you halfway between our offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to offer $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to my price, the increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely I'll be able to bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable, and I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
