,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16000? That would be fair to both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $16000 is a fair price for the product. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
