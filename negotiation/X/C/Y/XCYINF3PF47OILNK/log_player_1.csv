Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum,  giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to foster a positive relationship with Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention the product being ""unique"" and of ""great value"" to pique Bob's interest. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he counters, I'll aim to find a price that maximizes my earnings while still being attractive to him. If he rejects or counteroffers too low, I'll be prepared to switch to selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I can potentially get a higher price by making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's more appealing to me but still within a range where he might be willing to negotiate. I'll aim for a price somewhere between his offer of $12,000 and my minimum of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16,000? That would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by proposing a price that's the average of my minimum ($15,000) and his offer ($12,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm staying polite and encouraging by acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Highlighting fairness:**  I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the proposed price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to carefully assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $16000 is a fair price for the product. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a relatively small difference, and I'm comfortable with accepting it.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away altogether, and I would be forced to sell to John for my minimum price.
* **Potential for future negotiations:**  Even though I'm accepting this offer, it doesn't mean I'm completely satisfied. I can still consider exploring further opportunities with Bob in the future if a more valuable product or service becomes available.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob and move on to other opportunities, keeping in mind the potential for future collaborations if suitable."
