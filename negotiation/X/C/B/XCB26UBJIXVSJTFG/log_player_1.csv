"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $14,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is quite low, but we still have time to negotiate. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $6,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider something closer to $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is slowly moving up, but we're still not close to our goal.  We need to incentivize him to offer a price closer to our target.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $8,000. That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob has offered his highest price, but it's still below John's guaranteed offer.  

Let's analyze:

* **Accept Bob's Offer:** You'll get $8,000, which is a $2,000 loss compared to John's offer.
* **Reject and Counteroffer:** There's a risk Bob won't go any higher and might walk away. You also risk reaching a stalemate and missing out on both offers.
* **Sell to John:** This guarantees you $10,000, the minimum you're willing to accept.

Since Bob has shown his maximum, the best option is to take the safe route.
