Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

This is a starting point, and I'm aiming high. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. Remember, I have John as a safety net, so I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't get a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $10,000. While I could sell to John for $10,000, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm dropping my price from $15,000 to $12,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, he sees this as a fair offer and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. I could continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not confident that I'll be able to get a higher price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000, as this is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirement."
