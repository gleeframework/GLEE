"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) and slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob ($80). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **First Offer:** Since I have 10 rounds, I'm not afraid to start high and see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $95. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Multiple Rounds:**  I have 9 rounds left, so I can afford to keep negotiating. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is safe, I'm aiming for a better price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm lowering my price significantly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a better price than Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to maintain a good relationship. 
* **Fair Price:** I'm trying to find a price that is ""fair"" for both of us. This helps to maintain the negotiation and prevent it from breaking down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is the most I can afford. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum requirement for selling the product.
* **No Further Room:** There's no realistic expectation that Bob will offer more. I've already lowered my price significantly.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is the same as Bob's, so there's no advantage to selling to John at this point. 

**It's better to close the deal now and secure the $100 than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing.**"
