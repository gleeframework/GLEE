,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $105 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $100. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was a bit high, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer $102.50. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
