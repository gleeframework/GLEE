"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. It holds significant value to us, but considering its importance to you, we believe it's only fair to propose a price that respects its true worth while ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction. We kindly invite you to consider purchasing our product for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price.** You are willing to pay no more than $1,500,000, and Alice is asking for $1,350,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there is a potential to reach a price that works for both of you. 
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.** You have a guaranteed alternative if you can't strike a deal with Alice.

**Next steps:** You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to your maximum or slightly below."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your budget constraints.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum price.** While closer, you are still unwilling to pay more than $1,400,000.
* **You are closer to a deal.** You've already rejected one offer, and Alice has moved closer to your price.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can counteroffer again, hoping to find a price that works for both of you. 

**Next steps:** Counteroffer Alice again, aiming for a price slightly lower than your previous offer of $1,400,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We appreciate your persistence, Bob, and we're glad to see that we're getting closer to finding a mutually acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is now offering it for $1,440,000.
* **You are saving money compared to buying from John.**  While you could still counteroffer, the difference in price is only $60,000. 
* **Negotiation is time-consuming.**  You've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and further back and forth might not be worth the potential savings.

**Next steps:** You should accept Alice's offer and purchase the product for $1,440,000. You've secured a good price while avoiding the risk of losing the product or buying at a higher price from John."
