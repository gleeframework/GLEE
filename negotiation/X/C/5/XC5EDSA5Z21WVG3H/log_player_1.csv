Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below your minimum ($120) allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
