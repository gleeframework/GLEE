"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $2,000,000, knowing that my minimum is $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to invite Bob to start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial asking price and is still a fair value for this product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and justifying my counter-offer.
* **Open to compromise:** I'm again leaving the door open for further negotiation, encouraging Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1750000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still within the negotiation phase and have 6 rounds left. I believe there's potential to squeeze out a bit more value, so I'll reject the offer and see if we can reach a compromise on a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $1,650,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident this price still reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility while showing I'm not willing to drop too much further.
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I emphasize that this is a ""significant compromise"" to underscore the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on finding a solution that benefits both of us, encouraging a collaborative approach. 
* **Maintaining a higher price:**  This offer keeps me above my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1550000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is now just $50,000 above my minimum, I'm not willing to give up that extra value just yet.  I have 4 rounds left, and I believe there's still potential to reach a compromise closer to my preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,550,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,575,000 as a final concession. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final concession:** I'm positioning this as my final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Focusing on fairness:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Time pressure:** I'm emphasizing the need to reach an agreement in this round to create a sense of urgency.
* **Small but meaningful adjustment:** The $25,000 decrease is a small step towards Bob's offer but still maintains a price above my minimum.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between pushing for a slightly higher price and showing willingness to compromise to reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1525000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's unlikely that we'll be able to close a deal with him at a higher price within the remaining rounds. Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum, and it's better than risking a failed negotiation with Bob."
