"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob (""great deal"") to make him more inclined to accept. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm leaving a significant gap between my initial offer and my minimum acceptable price, so we have room to negotiate in the following rounds.

**Important Note:** This is just my first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's better than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Counteroffer with a slight concession:**  I'm making a counteroffer at $10,000, which shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to drastically lower my price. This maintains my position and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Still not selling to John:** It's too early to sell to John. We have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can reach a more favorable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is closer to what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining the pressure:** I'm still above Bob's offer, but I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize my price point.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""close the deal"" to nudge Bob towards accepting. 

**Strategy:**

I'm gradually moving towards a price that's closer to my target, but not too fast. I want to create a sense of urgency without making Bob feel pressured into accepting a price that's too high for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is getting closer:** His offer is higher than his previous one and closer to my target.
* **Counteroffer to stay above my minimum:** I'm countering with $10,250, which is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm still interested in a deal with Bob.
* **Avoid selling to John yet:** We have several rounds remaining, and I believe we can still reach a more favorable price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm gradually narrowing the price gap and moving towards a compromise. I'm trying to maintain a balance between pushing for a higher price and maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence.  $10,250 is a fair price given the value I'm offering.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time and offer it for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'd hate to see this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I'm making my final concession by dropping to $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasis on value and opportunity:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and the risk of losing the deal.
* **Urgency and closing:** I'm using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""slip away"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm putting the ball in Bob's court with a final offer. If he doesn't accept, I'll move on to John in the next round. It's a calculated risk, but I believe this offer is attractive enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's counteroffers are not significantly increasing.
* **Value gap:** There is still a significant gap between my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). 
* **John's offer is significantly higher:** Selling to John will guarantee a much higher profit than accepting Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:**

While I'm still open to reaching an agreement with Bob, the risks of continuing to negotiate are too high.  John's offer guarantees a much better outcome for me. It's time to secure the deal and move on."
