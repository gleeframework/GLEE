"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. Considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, we're getting close, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  However, I need to be upfront about the value of what I'm offering.  To move forward, I can come down slightly to $2,025,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential this product holds.  We're running out of time to make this work, so I need a decision from you. ",2025000.0,Alice,7,
