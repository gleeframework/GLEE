"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial benchmark and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I want to maximize my potential profit.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see where he stands in terms of his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe the product holds more value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product higher than his initial offer. It's a good middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel there's room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore potential higher prices.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal, as John is already willing to pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway but still get a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Bob and we can close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000. While Bob's counteroffer is getting lower, it's clear he's not willing to meet my price expectations. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is high, and it might result in a lower price than what John is offering. 

I'm confident that John's offer secures my minimum acceptable price, and it's time to finalize the deal."
