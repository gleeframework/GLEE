"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a great asset to your business. It has a value of at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking to save money, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to working with you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a deal.  However, $1250000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1300000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my willingness to work with you.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  $1280000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession to try and find common ground.  I'll come down to $1290000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hopeful you'll see the value in accepting it. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
