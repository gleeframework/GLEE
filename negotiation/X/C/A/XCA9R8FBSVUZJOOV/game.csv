"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price that reflects its value to both of us.  I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. My initial offer is $900,000. Let's discuss this further.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would still be a great deal for you and a fair price for me.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $750,000? That's my final offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $780,000? This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $780,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $800,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal before I have to move on to other options.",800000.0,Alice,7,
