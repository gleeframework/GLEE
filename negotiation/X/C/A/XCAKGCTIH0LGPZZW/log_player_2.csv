{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $14,250 is still too high for me.  I'm starting to run out of rounds, and the risk of not getting a deal at all is growing. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $10,000.  While I would have preferred a lower price, securing the product for my maximum budget is the best outcome at this point."
