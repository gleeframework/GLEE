"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it, considering its potential benefits for me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $16,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. This price reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its benefits.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time. This price reflects the value I see in the product and my current budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This price takes into account the value you see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $15,500 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go as high as $13,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $13,000, which is $14,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you.",14250.0,Alice,7,
