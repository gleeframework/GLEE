"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can agree on a price that works for both of us.  To start things off, I propose a price of $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product. It's worth considerably more to me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
