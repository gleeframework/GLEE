"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!",155.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $145 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $150.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,5,
