While $1,100,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's desired price range. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price closer to his $1,200,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is certainly a respectable sum, I believe the true value of this product, especially given the benefits it will bring you, is significantly higher.
