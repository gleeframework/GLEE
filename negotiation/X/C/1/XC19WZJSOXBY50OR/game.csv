"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but  $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle on $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
