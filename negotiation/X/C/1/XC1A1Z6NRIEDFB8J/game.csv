"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, as that's the absolute maximum I can afford right now. I'm really interested in the product, so hopefully we can find a compromise.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but $135 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $145. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $145 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is the absolute maximum I can do. If we can reach an agreement, I'm happy to move forward with the purchase.",140.0,Bob,6,
