"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've made a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $50. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but also sets a clear lower limit.  I'm hoping she'll see the value in closing the deal quickly rather than risking a longer negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $125. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price point of $120.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get her down to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $125 is still a bit too high for me. However, I'm committed to making this deal work. I'm willing to offer $115. This is the absolute highest I can go, so let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating flexibility. However, I'm staying below my $120 maximum while pushing Alice closer to my target. This shows commitment while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your commitment to making this deal work. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $120. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 matches my maximum price point.  Since I can buy the product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to rejecting this offer and risking further negotiation. It's best to accept and close the deal."
