"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm offering it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $125 is still a bit too high for me. However, I'm committed to making this deal work. I'm willing to offer $115. This is the absolute highest I can go, so let's see if we can close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your commitment to making this deal work. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $120. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close the deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
