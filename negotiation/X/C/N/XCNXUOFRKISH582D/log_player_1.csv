Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Gauging interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into how badly he wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but never go below $800,000."
