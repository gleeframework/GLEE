Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still reasonable for you, to create room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This still leaves some room for profit, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and respect the value of the product to you. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,200 for the product. I hope this proposal is more acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $12,200 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. The negotiation seems to be stalling, and I don't want to risk losing out on the full $15,000. It's time to sell to John."
