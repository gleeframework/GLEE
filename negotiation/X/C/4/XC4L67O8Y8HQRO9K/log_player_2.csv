"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is less than your maximum budget of $10,000, there's still room to negotiate and potentially save more. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my original price. How about $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,250, which is a good price for me, considering I'm willing to pay up to $10,000.  Accepting her offer ensures I get the product while saving $750 compared to buying from John."
