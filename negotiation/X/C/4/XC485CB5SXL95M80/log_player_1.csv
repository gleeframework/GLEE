Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $87.5 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle too quickly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $86 is tempting, we're getting close to my minimum price of $80, and I'm still confident I can get a bit more.  I'm going to try to push for a price closer to $88."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure the $80 sale than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
