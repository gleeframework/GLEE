"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to $1,200,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? That's the best I can do.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I've already found another seller who is willing to sell it to me for $1,200,000. I'm afraid I'll have to go with that offer if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $1,290,000?",1290000.0,Bob,6,
