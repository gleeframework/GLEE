(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly aiming high with her initial offer. She knows her product is worth less to her ($800,000) than your maximum price ($1,000,000).
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay such a high price. This may prompt her to come back with a lower offer closer to your acceptable range.
* You have a backup plan with John at $1,000,000, so you're not at risk of losing the product entirely. 

**Strategy:** Aim to negotiate a price closer to $850,000 - $900,000 with Alice."
