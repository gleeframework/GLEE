"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation to see if he's willing to budge. I'm confident I can get a better price than $120 from John, so I'm willing to negotiate with Bob for a few rounds before resorting to that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the deal, but I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'm also not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price a bit to show good faith, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
