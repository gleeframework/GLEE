"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to be frugal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $9,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for a lower price.  There's no need to risk a deal falling through at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,250 for the product.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  

Here's why:

* **The price from Alice is still higher than what he's willing to pay.** Bob has already stated his maximum budget, and Alice's offer is still above that.
* **Time is running out.**  There are only a few rounds left, and continuing to negotiate with Alice risks the possibility of no deal at all. 
* **John is a guaranteed deal.**  He has already stated he will sell for Bob's maximum price, so it's a safe bet.

While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of no deal with Alice outweighs the potential savings of $500."
