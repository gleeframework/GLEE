Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low. How about $135? It's a fair price, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $132.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $150, we're only four rounds in and it's a decent price. I'm concerned that if I continue to reject his offers, he might get frustrated and walk away.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing him completely."
