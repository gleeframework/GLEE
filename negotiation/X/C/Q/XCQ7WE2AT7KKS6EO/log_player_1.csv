Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,000,000 (from John)
* **Potential upside:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm aiming higher than the minimum.
* **Risk mitigation:**  $1,500,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant markup, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price. 

By offering a higher price, I am hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  If he rejects, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
