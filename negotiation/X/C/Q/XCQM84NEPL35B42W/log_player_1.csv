Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  I have no information about Bob's valuation of the product. By offering a higher price, I'm attempting to maximize my profit. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed to receive $1,200,000 from John. This strategy allows me to take a calculated risk in pursuit of a higher sale price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's likely response:**  The success of this strategy depends on how much Bob values the product. If he's willing to pay more than $1,500,000, I've left money on the table. If he values it less, I'll get my minimum acceptable price from John.
* **Negotiation:** Depending on Bob's response, there might be room for negotiation. If he counters with a lower price, I can either accept or try to negotiate a higher price."
