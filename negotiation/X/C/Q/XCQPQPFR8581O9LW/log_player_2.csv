"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than John's offer of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  He knows the product is worth less to Alice than to him, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  That's a fair price considering the value to me and your willingness to sell.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $8,500. This is a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's offer of $12,000 and closer to Bob's desired price point. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might walk away or counter with a higher price, making John's offer the only option. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a favorable price."
