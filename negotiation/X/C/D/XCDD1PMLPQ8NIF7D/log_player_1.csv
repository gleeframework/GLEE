"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $70 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $82.50. This is my final offer."",
 ""product_price"": 82.50
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we agree on $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly willing to pay more than $70 and is moving closer to our acceptable range. We're still above our minimum selling price to John, so we have leverage to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $78.75? This is a very fair offer."",
 ""product_price"": 78.75
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up to $77, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, $77 is a decent offer and only slightly below our guaranteed sale price to John. It's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower offer or having to sell to John at the last minute."
