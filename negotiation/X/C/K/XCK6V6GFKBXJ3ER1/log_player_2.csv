"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential and allows for a healthy margin. Let's discuss a price of $1,400,000. This represents a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,500,000.  There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get closer to your desired savings by rejecting her initial offer."
