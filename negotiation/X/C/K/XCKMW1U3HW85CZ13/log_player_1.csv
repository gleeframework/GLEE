"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the product's value, so I'm aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product has value beyond $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting closer to my minimum and we're already in Round 4.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  $16,000 is a good profit, and I'd rather secure the sale than push for more and potentially lose the deal."
