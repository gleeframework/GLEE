Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation while keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value.
* **No Urgency:** You don't want to seem desperate, especially since you have John as a backup.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get an excellent deal.
* **Bob Counters:**  He'll likely counter lower. You can negotiate down slightly, but hold firm closer to $1,400,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and get your guaranteed $1,500,000."
