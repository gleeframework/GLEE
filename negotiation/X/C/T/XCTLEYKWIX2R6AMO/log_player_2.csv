"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $115.  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer will likely save Bob some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $110, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than John's offer.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice, saving Bob $10 compared to buying from John."
