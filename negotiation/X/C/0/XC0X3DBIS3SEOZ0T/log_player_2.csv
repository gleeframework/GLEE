"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for less than $12,000. Since it's worth $15,000 to Bob, there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Still within Bob's budget:**  $10,000 is well within Bob's $15,000 limit. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room for Alice to come down a bit and meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price. How about $11000?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $12,000 to $11,000. While Bob might be able to squeeze out a bit more, this price is a good compromise, and it's still much cheaper than buying from John. Accepting the offer is the best option to secure the product at a good price within Bob's budget."
