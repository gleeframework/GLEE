Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value ($8,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value for Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a good starting price:** $12,000 is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing my desired profit. 
* **Set the tone for negotiation:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value for Bob, which might make him more likely to accept a higher price. 

**Important:** This is just a starting offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the potential for a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $10,000 is still a good price for me, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate.
*  I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price. How about $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message is positive and reiterates the value of the product for Bob. It also highlights the benefit of finding a mutually beneficial solution, encouraging him to accept. 

This approach is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:**  The counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  $11,000 is still a good price for me, allowing me to make a profit.
* **Encourage further negotiation:** By focusing on a mutually beneficial solution, I might get Bob to consider a price closer to my desired value."
