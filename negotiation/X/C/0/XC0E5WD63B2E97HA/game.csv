"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure will bring you great value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we possibly settle on $975,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To be honest, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'd hoped. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? It seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already made a concession by offering $1,025,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to give you a small incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in some additional services or support worth $25,000, which would bring the total value to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
