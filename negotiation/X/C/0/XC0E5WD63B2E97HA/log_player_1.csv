Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

However, I'm willing to give you a small incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in some additional services or support worth $25,000, which would bring the total value to $1,050,000.
