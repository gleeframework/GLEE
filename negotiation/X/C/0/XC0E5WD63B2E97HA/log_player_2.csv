Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To be honest, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'd hoped. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? It seems like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already made a concession by offering $1,025,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to give you a small incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in some additional services or support worth $25,000, which would bring the total value to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to budge from her $1,025,000 price, and the added incentives bring the deal closer to a fair compromise. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better result, and John's offer is considerably higher."
