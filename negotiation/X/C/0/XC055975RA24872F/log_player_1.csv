Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it for a little less still earns us a profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still keeps the price significantly above our minimum ($15,000).
* **Positive Language:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value proposition and inviting Bob's input without being overly pushy.

This approach aims to secure a deal with Bob at a favorable price while keeping the backup option (John) available if needed."
