"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. $12,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $9,500? I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you. I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,7,
