,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However,  $18000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $16000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. How about $14500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. After reconsidering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell it to you for $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $15500 is very close to my limit, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $15250? It's a fair price for both, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",15250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15250 is getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to give up yet. I'll make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $15000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,7,
