"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $95 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount and sell it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's my absolute limit.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $98 is your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $98, which is $101.50. What do you think?",101.5,Alice,7,
