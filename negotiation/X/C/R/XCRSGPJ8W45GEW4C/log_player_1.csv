Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like for $150. It's in great condition and I'm confident it's worth the price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Profit Margin:** Offering the product at $150 gives Alice a potential $30 profit margin if Bob accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John who is willing to pay $120, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while still offering Bob a price that's within a reasonable range of its value to him."
