,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good offer, it's still below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a more reasonable price for me. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable compromise. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I value your continued interest,  $9,800 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,200, but I won't go any lower. This is a fair compromise given the product's value. Let's close this deal, it's a win-win for both of us!",10200.0,Alice,7,
