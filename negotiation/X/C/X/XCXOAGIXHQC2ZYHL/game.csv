"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $1,000,000. This price allows you a significant profit while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
