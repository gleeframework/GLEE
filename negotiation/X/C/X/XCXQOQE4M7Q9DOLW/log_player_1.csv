I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll see how high his counteroffer is, and adjust accordingly. I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for $12,000, so I have a solid fallback position."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $15,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a counteroffer of $13,500. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob while still getting me closer to my desired price."

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $12,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than my minimum and closer to my initial goal than selling to John. I think it's a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal."
