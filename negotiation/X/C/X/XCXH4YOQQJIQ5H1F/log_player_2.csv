"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price. You can still get the product for less than $10,000 from Alice, and if you fail, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $8,750. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me.

Alice's offer is within your budget and a good compromise. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a good price, saving you money compared to buying from John."
