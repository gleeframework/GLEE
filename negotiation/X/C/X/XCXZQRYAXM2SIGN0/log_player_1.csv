Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as much money as possible, so starting high is beneficial.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($12,000) leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially still land on a price favorable to Alice. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a strong fallback position.  Alice doesn't need to desperately lowball Bob."
