"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",8200.0,Bob,4,
