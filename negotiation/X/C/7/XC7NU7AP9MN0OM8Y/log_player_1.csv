Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high to scare him off immediately.  I'm leaving room for negotiation and giving him a reason to think about the deal.  It's also important to be friendly and build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is just above my minimum value of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is the best option to maximize my profit.  It's also a good compromise, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely."
