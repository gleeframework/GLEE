Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible.  Offering it at a higher price initially allows room for negotiation or to determine Bob's price sensitivity.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $100, so there's no risk of losing money.
* **Potential Loss Aversion:** Bob might be more likely to accept a slightly higher price than risk losing the opportunity to buy it at all. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, I might adjust my price to ensure a sale while still aiming for the highest possible profit."
