"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This price is fair considering your value for it and my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better deal for this incredible product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a great compromise, considering its true value to you is $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $875000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $925000. Let's try to find a middle ground.",912500.0,Alice,5,
