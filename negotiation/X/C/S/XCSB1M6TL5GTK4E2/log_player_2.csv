"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1200000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  You can save money by making a counteroffer.  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so you should be able to get it for a price closer to that value."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better deal for this incredible product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a great compromise, considering its true value to you is $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to negotiate further to get a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $925000. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is getting closer to my target price. While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings are diminishing. It's likely that further negotiation will result in a small reduction in price, but it's not worth the time and effort.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product for a good price without risking a stalemate or having to pay the higher price from John."
