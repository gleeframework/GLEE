"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,800. This is a compromise that I think is still fair, considering the value the product brings to you.",6800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $6,800 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $6,600.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me.",6600.0,Bob,4,
