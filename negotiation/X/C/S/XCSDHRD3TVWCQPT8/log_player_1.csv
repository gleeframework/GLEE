"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $100 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. I'm also being friendly and hopeful in my message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer guarantees me the minimum profit and avoids any further risk of a failed negotiation."
