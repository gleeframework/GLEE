Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, knowing it's above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium, but I'm prepared to work down to a lower price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$80 is far too low for me. It's below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with $120. This is my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to go a bit higher, considering he rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $95 is still below my initial asking price, it's closer to my minimum and a better deal than selling to John for $120. There's no guarantee Bob will counteroffer again, so it's better to take the offer now."
