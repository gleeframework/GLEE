Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth at least $8,000, and to make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I have a safety net and room to negotiate higher with Bob.  Starting at $10,000 allows me to potentially gain an extra $2,000. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always negotiate down, knowing my minimum acceptable price is $8,000."
