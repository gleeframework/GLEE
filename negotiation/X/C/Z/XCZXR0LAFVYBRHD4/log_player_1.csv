Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring if we can reach a compromise in the next round, but I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. I have a guaranteed buyer in John, and there's a good chance we can reach a better agreement with Bob in the next rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. We've gone through several rounds, and there's no guarantee that Bob will agree to a price I'm comfortable with. I've already established a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, and there's no reason to risk a lower price with Bob."
