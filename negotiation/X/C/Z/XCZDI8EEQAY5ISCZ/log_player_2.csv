"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. Since you have 10 rounds, there's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 was a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,800. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your target of $10,000. With 7 rounds remaining, it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $10,250.  This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,800 was still a bit too high for you. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is very close to your desired price point of $10,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'll be left with only a few rounds to reach an agreement. Additionally, you're within $500 of your target, and the product is likely worth $10,000 to you. It's a good deal, and you can save $500 compared to buying from John."
