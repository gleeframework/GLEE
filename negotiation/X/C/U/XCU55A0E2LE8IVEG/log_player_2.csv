"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John is selling for, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($150). You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is still a good deal for Alice, as it's more than what the product is worth to her ($80). This leaves room for potential negotiation, but also ensures a significant discount for me compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is less than John's price, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $110. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's more than what the product is worth to her ($80), but it also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to pay less, $125 is a reasonable price given that:

* It's less than John's price ($150).
* It's more than what the product is worth to Alice ($80), so it's likely a fair deal for both of us.
* Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it risks Alice walking away and leaving me with no other option than to buy from John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $125 is the most logical choice, securing a purchase within my budget while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
