Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value,  $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, reflecting its worth to me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
