"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? That leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
