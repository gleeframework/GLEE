"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice's offer is at that price.  There is no benefit to accepting her offer, as you can get the same product for the same price from John. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy."
