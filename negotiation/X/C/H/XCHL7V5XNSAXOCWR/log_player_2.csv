"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is way too high. It's a good starting point for negotiation but not a good deal for Bob. It's better to reject and counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay a fair price, but $850,000 is my maximum.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this incredible product. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,100,000 is still too much for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his budget.  There is room for further negotiation, and Bob should continue to push for a lower price.  It's also worth considering that John is still an option for a lower price if the negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $975,000 is closer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm firm on my offer of $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 900000}
