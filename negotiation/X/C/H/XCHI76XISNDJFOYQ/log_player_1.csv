Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I believe a price of $900,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John provides a safety net at $800,000, Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000.  We want to get as close to that $1,000,000 as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $900,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above our minimum.  
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning this is an exclusive offer for Bob, it might encourage him to act quickly and accept the high price."
