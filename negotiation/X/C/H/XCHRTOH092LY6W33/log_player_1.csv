Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my potential profit while still remaining attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
``` 
I'm adjusting my offer slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm aiming for a price that's in the middle ground, hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, accepting this offer is a good compromise.  It's  a better deal than selling to John, and it saves more time and energy from further negotiation."
