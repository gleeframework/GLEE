"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $150 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $100 is more than what the product is worth to him, it's significantly less than my minimum. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above my minimum of $150 but closer to Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $130. I'm hoping this offer is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125, which is just a bit higher than Bob's offer but still within my acceptable range. This shows that I'm flexible and willing to meet halfway, but I'm not going to give the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  We're only $5 apart, but I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go lower. It's time to move on and sell to John.  He's willing to pay my minimum, and I can avoid further negotiation."
