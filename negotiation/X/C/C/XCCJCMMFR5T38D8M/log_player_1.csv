Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I do see value in the product, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I could consider a purchase closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, there is still a substantial gap between our valuations.  To be candid, anything above $1,000,000 is pushing my budget limits. I could offer $925,000 as a show of good faith, but that's my best. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my valuation, his highest offer ($925,000) is still significantly less than what John is offering ($1,200,000). It makes more financial sense to accept John's offer and secure the guaranteed profit. Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him not meeting my minimum price."
