"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I do see value in the product, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I could consider a purchase closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  I believe this product will bring you significant returns in the long run.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, there is still a substantial gap between our valuations.  To be candid, anything above $1,000,000 is pushing my budget limits. I could offer $925,000 as a show of good faith, but that's my best.",925000.0,Bob,4,
