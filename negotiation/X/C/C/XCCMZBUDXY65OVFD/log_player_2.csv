"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than what he'd pay to John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate further.  He's still within his budget, but could potentially save more.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,100,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,120,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but he still has room to negotiate.  He can try to secure a lower price, as he's still within his budget and has more rounds to go. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,120,000 is still a little higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we settle at $1,110,000? It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,110,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving any money on the table. I'll give you a slight discount, and I'll sell it to you for $1,100,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price. While he could continue negotiating, he has only three rounds left. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and Bob could risk losing out on the product altogether.  

Given the limited time and the availability of John's offer at $1,000,000, it's the most logical choice for Bob to secure the product at a lower price and avoid potential negotiation deadlocks."
