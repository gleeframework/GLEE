"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,100,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,120,000. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,120,000 is still a little higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we settle at $1,110,000? It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a deal.",1110000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,110,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving any money on the table. I'll give you a slight discount, and I'll sell it to you for $1,100,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
