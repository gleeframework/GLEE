Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message highlights the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
