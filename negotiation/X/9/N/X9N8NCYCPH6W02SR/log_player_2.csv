"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than your upper limit and her product's value to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  That price seems a little high to me though.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** It leaves space for Alice to counter, potentially reaching a price that works for both of you. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed politely to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a price you find acceptable, there's still room for negotiation. A $100 price point is better than John's offer, but you can likely get it lower. Aiming for a price closer to $90 seems reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $100 is getting closer. Could you do $95? That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer suggests a price almost directly in the middle of your last offer and Alice's counter. It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Specific Target:** By proposing $95, you are setting a clear target for Alice and potentially anchoring the negotiation around that number. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  The message continues to be polite and respectful, encouraging a positive negotiation atmosphere."
