{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the value of the product for Bob, which can encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  That price seems a little high to me though.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $100 is getting closer. Could you do $95? That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. It is unlikely that I will be able to get a better price through further negotiation, so accepting his offer seems like the best option."
