"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and might even result in you getting more than you initially hoped for.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $180, I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation but also valuing the product significantly. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below both my minimum ($120) and his own stated value ($120). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm looking for a price closer to the product's actual worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $150? I'm confident this product will be valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial offer of $180, signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still significantly above Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him why he was initially interested.
* **Leaving Room:**  While $150 is closer to my minimum, there's still some wiggle room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is low, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, it's not guaranteed Bob would go higher, and it's not worth risking the sure sale at $120."
