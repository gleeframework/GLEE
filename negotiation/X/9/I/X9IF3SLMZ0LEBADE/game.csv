"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
