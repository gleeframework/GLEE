"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $9000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price of $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,

I'll sell the product to you for $10300, and I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services to sweeten the deal.
