{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob is willing to pay significantly more. My goal is to get as close to his $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **For Bob:** He saves $75,000 compared to his maximum valuation.
    * **For Alice:** I earn $125,000 more than selling to John.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still keeping me well above my minimum."
