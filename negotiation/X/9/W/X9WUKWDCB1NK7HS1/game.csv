"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. Would you consider lowering the price to a maximum of $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
