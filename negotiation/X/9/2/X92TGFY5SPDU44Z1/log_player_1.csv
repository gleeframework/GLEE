Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $110 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  The offer is significantly higher than John's $80, ensuring you're maximizing your potential earnings. 

This strategy balances profit maximization with a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
