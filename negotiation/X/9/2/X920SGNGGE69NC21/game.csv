"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I think $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm confident this product is worth the investment. How about we split the difference at $10,000? This is my final offer, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get.  Let me know if you're ready to make a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
