{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum of $100, but I'm not starting too high to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a nice product, but $125 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell and believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand $125 was a bit high, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $110? It's a great deal for a fantastic product!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see we're getting closer, Alice. How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $105 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and getting closer to the value of the product to Bob.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer."
