"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll be selling the product to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
