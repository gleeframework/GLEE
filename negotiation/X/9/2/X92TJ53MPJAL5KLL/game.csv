"Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product is intriguing, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $850,000, which is still a great deal for you, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000. It's a step in the right direction.  I'm still a little above my target price, but I'm willing to go to $800,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I think we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,,
