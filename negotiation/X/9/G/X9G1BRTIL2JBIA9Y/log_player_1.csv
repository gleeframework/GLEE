Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm not going to sell for a price significantly lower than my last offer. I'm confident I can get closer to $10,500 with a few more rounds of negotiation."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further, and I've already rejected several offers that were significantly lower than my desired price.  It's better to sell to John for $15,000 and guarantee a good profit. There's no point in wasting more time with Bob."
