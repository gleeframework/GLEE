{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but allows room for negotiation.  
* **The message:** It's friendly and open-ended to encourage a conversation. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high because I don't know Bob's value for the product. If he's truly interested, he may be willing to negotiate closer to my desired price. If he's not interested,  I can always accept John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested but would like to propose a lower price of $10000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell at that price. 

**Reasoning:**

While I want to make a sale, I'm not desperate. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,500:** This is a compromise, halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still being above my floor.
* **The message:** It's positive and reiterates the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to gauge Bob's level of interest and see if he's willing to come up. If he's not, I can still go with John's offer, but I want to see if there's more room for negotiation before settling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $11000. This seems to be closer to our mutual expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is now above my minimum value of $12,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and  I'm willing to take it. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag this out, and I have a backup offer from John.
* **Potential for loss:** If I reject Bob's offer and counter, there's a risk he'll walk away, leaving me with John's offer, which is less than what Bob is now willing to pay.
* **It's a reasonable deal:**  $11,000 is a decent profit for me.  

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid potential further negotiation risks."
