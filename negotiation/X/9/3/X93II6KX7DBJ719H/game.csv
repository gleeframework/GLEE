"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be worth $6,000 to me. Would you consider that?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $14,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $14,000 is still too high for my budget. I could stretch to $7,000. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $7,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a great deal for you!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit rich for me.  How about $8,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
