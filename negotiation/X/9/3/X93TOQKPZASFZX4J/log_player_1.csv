"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging Bob's higher perceived value.  It also sets a strong initial position for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950000. This is a fair price that allows us both to profit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially considering Bob acknowledged the product's value to him.  I will counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I understand the product's value to you is high, but I also need to ensure a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing both of us to gain from this transaction. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair return, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm confident that $1000000 is a fair price for both of us,  allowing you to profit and me to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can push for a slightly higher amount. I'm confident that Bob is motivated to secure the product, given its value to him. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
