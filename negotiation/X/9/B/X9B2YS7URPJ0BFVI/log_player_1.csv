"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $11,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down. I believe this is a good starting point, but if he rejects it, I'll be ready to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is still below my minimum, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my minimum price and demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be more enticing to Bob, but if he still rejects, I'll consider my other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll reject and counteroffer again, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,250.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I still think there's room for negotiation. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but if he rejects it again, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. It's getting late in the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing too much value. I'll counteroffer one more time, but if Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum price, and I'm willing to sell to John if Bob rejects it. I'm hoping that Bob will realize this is the best deal he's going to get and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're running out of time. It's not worth risking another round to potentially get a lower price. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value and avoids any further risk."
