"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, it's still too early in the negotiation to accept. By rejecting, Bob can try to get an even better price.  There's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a lower starting point for the negotiation and signals Bob's serious intent to secure a good deal. A $15 drop from $75 is a substantial reduction and should incentivize Alice to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $65, which is within Bob's acceptable range of $120. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it also closes the deal quickly without risking further rounds of negotiation."
