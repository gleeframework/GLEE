Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a reasonable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **The Gap:** There's a $500,000 difference between what Bob values the product at and your minimum.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a strong position because you have another buyer.

**Crafting the Offer**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also need to make the offer appealing enough that Bob would consider it over simply walking away. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still staying above your absolute minimum.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's benefits to Bob's business aims to shift his focus from just the price.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob less likely to walk away easily. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. He may counter-offer. Have a walk-away price in mind. 
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might be willing to go slightly lower. However, remember your bottom line.
