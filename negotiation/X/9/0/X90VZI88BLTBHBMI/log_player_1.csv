I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a good starting point to see how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could sell to John for $10,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product at a much higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price, but I've already spent a few rounds negotiating and it seems he's not willing to go higher. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when I have a guaranteed sale to John for the same amount."
