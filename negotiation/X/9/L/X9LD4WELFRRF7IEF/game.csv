,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying if you could come down to $140.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $155? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
