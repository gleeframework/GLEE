Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which still leaves me some room for profit.  Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal.  However, $1,100,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still not a viable option for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
