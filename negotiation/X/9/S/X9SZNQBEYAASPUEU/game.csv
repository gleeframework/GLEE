"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer considering my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which still leaves me some room for profit.  Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal.  However, $1,100,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still not a viable option for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
