"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $120.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($120 < $150).**  
* **You save money compared to buying from John ($150 - $120 = $30 savings).** 
* **Even though you value the product at $150, getting it for $120 is a good deal.**"
