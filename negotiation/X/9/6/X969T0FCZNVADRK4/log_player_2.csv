"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  Costs $950,000, which is better than the $1,200,000 you'd pay John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  Forces you to buy from John at a higher price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob, as it saves him $250,000."
