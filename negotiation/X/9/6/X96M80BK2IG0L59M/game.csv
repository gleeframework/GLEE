"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000?  I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach an agreement, but I believe this is a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $887,500. This is my final offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $887,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $862,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!",862500.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $886,250. Let's split the difference one last time - I'm offering $875,000. If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do. I'm ready to move forward if you are.",875000.0,Bob,8,
