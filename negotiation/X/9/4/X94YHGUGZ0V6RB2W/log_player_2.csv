"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1700000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still below its true worth. While I'm confident I can get $1500000 from another buyer, I'd prefer to work with you if the price is right. Consider this offer carefully - it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
