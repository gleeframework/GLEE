Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $90 is above your $80 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $100, so there's space for him to counter-offer without you feeling like you're giving away too much.
* **It's a friendly approach:**  The message is inviting and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum desired profit. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, as you've already established his interest and he's willing to pay more than your absolute minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, which still leaves some room for us both to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Room for further negotiation:** The offer leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter with a price closer to your desired $90.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $82.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:**  $82.50 is above your minimum desired profit of $80. 
* **Minimizes risk:**  While you could potentially get closer to your ideal price of $90, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a rejection or Bob simply walking away from the deal.  $82.50 is a good compromise.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $80 would be less profitable than accepting Bob's offer."
