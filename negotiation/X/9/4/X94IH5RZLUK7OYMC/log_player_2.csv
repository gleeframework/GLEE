"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $180 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $120.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $155. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still higher than my maximum budget of $120. It's tempting to accept, but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  It's the absolute maximum I can pay. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $145. This is my final offer in this range. Let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $145 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick to my maximum price point and see if Alice will budge. There are still rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to buy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm at $120. That's the best I can do. It's a fair price for both of us - you get to sell the product, and I get a great deal. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and my minimum price of $150, so I'm offering the product to you for $135. This is my last offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $135, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $120.  With only 3 rounds left, I'm not confident that I can get Alice to lower the price further. It's more advantageous to buy from John at $120 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
