"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $120.  Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  It's the absolute maximum I can pay. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",120.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $145. This is my final offer in this range. Let me know if it's acceptable to you.",145.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm at $120. That's the best I can do. It's a fair price for both of us - you get to sell the product, and I get a great deal. Let's close the deal!",120.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and my minimum price of $150, so I'm offering the product to you for $135. This is my last offer before I consider other options.",135.0,Alice,7,,
