Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below the product's true value. It has the potential to generate significant returns for you, and I'm sure you'll agree that a slightly higher investment will be worth it in the long run.  Let's find a compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to me, while also being mindful of my financial constraints.
