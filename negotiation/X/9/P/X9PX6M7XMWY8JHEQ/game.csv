"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing us both a profitable outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
