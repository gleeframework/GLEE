``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a good deal for you, leaving you with a profit of $200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counteroffer, and you can then decide to accept or reject based on his offer and whether it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1250000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still too low for you. You can likely do better than that by making a counteroffer and continuing the negotiation. It's worth trying to find common ground before settling for a price that's lower than you'd ideally like."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a fair price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This price is still a good value for me, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal. It's a significant increase from his previous offer, and you're still getting closer to your ideal price. Accepting this offer is a smart move, as it's likely you won't be able to get a much higher price from Bob, and you risk losing the sale altogether.  You also avoid the risk of having to take John's offer, which is lower."
