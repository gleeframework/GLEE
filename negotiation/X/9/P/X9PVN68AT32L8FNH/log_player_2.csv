# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. I believe this price is fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,400,000.
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's room for both of you to compromise. You can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You'll save money by negotiating with Alice, but if negotiations fail, you have a guaranteed option with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a fair price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down, but not enough.**  While her offer is better than the initial $1,400,000, it's still higher than your target. 
* **Further negotiation is likely.** You've already shown willingness to compromise, and Alice has responded.  You can likely reach an agreement closer to your target price.
* **John is still a backup.** While you're trying to save money, it's good to remember that John offers a guaranteed price if negotiations fail."
