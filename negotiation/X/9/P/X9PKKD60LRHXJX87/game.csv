"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely intriguing, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can make this deal work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking that $900,000 is a bit too low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
