**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking that $900,000 is a bit too low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent price and closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  At this point, I'm confident I can get the product from John for $800,000, which is the best deal for me. It's time to move on and secure the purchase."
