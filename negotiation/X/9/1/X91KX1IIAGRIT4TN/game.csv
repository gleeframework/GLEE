"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product as much as I do.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer you $800,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value we both see in the product and my budget limitations. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a stretch. I'm offering $900,000. This reflects a significant compromise from my original offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,7,
