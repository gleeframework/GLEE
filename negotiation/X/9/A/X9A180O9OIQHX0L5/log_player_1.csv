**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  At this stage, the increments he's offering are unlikely to get us to a point where I'd be making a reasonable profit. Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my product's value without further negotiation or risk of losing the deal."
