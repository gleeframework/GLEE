"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $720,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.
