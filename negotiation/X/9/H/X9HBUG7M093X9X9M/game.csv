"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 250 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at 200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $200 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my offer of $75.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $175 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100 for this product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a win-win scenario.",100.0,Bob,6,
