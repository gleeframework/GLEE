{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8000}
