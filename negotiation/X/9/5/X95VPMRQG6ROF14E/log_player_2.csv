{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to try and gauge Alice's flexibility. I'm aiming to get the price closer to her perceived value of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $70.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

Alice is coming down, but $85 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

I'm inching closer to her perceived value but staying firm on not overpaying. Let's see if she's willing to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met her own perceived value of the product. There's no guarantee of getting a lower price, and it's better than John's offer, so I'll accept the deal."
