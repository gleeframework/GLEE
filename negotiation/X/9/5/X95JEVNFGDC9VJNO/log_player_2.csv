Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $98. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?

Explanation:  Alice is very slowly lowering her price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $98, and it's better to buy from John at $100 than to continue haggling for a tiny discount."
