"Alice,  while I appreciate the offer, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product,  which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $950000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925000. It's a small compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
