"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's reach an agreement before we run out of time.",11000.0,Alice,5,
