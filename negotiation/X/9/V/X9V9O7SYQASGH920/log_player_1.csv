Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** The gap between my starting price and Bob's value is large enough to allow for counteroffers without risking selling it to John for less.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like we're working together to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher to secure the product. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, I have the guaranteed option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'd be happy to sell it to you for $13,000. This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not immediately going to John.  This shows I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm not desperate.
* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers. This signals a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to reciprocate.
* **Maintaining positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly to keep the negotiation open and avoid any potential for impasse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you. I would like to counter with a price of $12500. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Closing the gap:** There is a smaller gap now between our offers, which suggests that we are getting closer to a potential agreement. 
* **Continuing negotiations:** I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my desired amount before resorting to selling to John. I believe a counteroffer might get us closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $12,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $13,250?  This would give you a good deal and would also be closer to my minimum. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** I'm not giving up yet, as I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Small increment:** I'm only increasing my counteroffer by $250. This shows I'm being flexible but not giving in too easily.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal at this price, which might incentivize him to accept.
* **Positive and hopeful tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and hopeful tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I am willing to consider $13000 as a final offer. I believe this strikes a good balance between the value of the product to you and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 away from my last counteroffer.  It's a significant compromise from both sides.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and is very close to my desired price.
* **Time consideration:** The negotiation has taken a few rounds, and it's likely that continuing could lead to a delay and potential loss of interest from both parties.
* **Selling to John is still a safety net:**  If I were to reject Bob's offer, I could still sell to John for $15,000. However, the time and effort involved in getting to this point with Bob are significant, and accepting his offer is a pragmatic decision."
