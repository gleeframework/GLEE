Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Knowing its value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a chance to acquire a truly valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation creates a strong incentive for him to accept. A price of $925,000 gives you a significant profit margin ($125,000) while still being very attractive to Bob, saving him $75,000.

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Leaving Money on the Table:**  If you ask for the full $1,000,000, Bob might try to negotiate you down, potentially costing you time and profit.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:**  While you could try for a higher price and risk Bob rejecting the offer, this strategy aims for a highly probable sale at a great profit."
