Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but still a substantial profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for Bob, highlighting the potential value he'll gain. 

**Rationale:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could potentially get more from John, offering a lower price to Bob increases the chances of him accepting, allowing me to secure a sale sooner and avoid potential delays or complications.
* **Negotiation Space:** By offering a slightly lower price, I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Building a Relationship:**  Offering a fair price shows good faith and could potentially lead to future business opportunities with Bob."
