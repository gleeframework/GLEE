Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his range is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,500. This is still a good profit for me and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not sure if he'll increase his offer further.  Since John is also willing to pay $15,000, I'll go ahead and sell to John to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
