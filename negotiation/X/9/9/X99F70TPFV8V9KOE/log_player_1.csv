"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives Bob a good starting point while ensuring I don't immediately give away my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than his initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm increasing the price from Bob's offer to $105. This is still lower than my ideal price but shows I'm willing to compromise. I hope this encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure with fewer rounds remaining, $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll risk another round and see if Bob will budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $100. This is still a decent profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal. I believe this is a good compromise and could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire with only four rounds left. Bob's offer is getting increasingly unattractive. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and saves me the risk of further negotiations with Bob.  While I could try to get a better price from Bob, the risk of him rejecting my offer again and potentially forcing me to accept a lower price isn't worth it. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
