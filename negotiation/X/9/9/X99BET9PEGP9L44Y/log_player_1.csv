{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone, highlighting the value of the product and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting with a higher price, I leave room for negotiation and potentially earn closer to my desired amount.
* **Maintain a positive relationship:**  A friendly approach is crucial to encourage a successful negotiation.
* **Leave the door open for a counteroffer:** If Bob doesn't accept my initial offer, I can still negotiate further.
* **Secure a backup option:** Having John as a potential buyer gives me leverage and a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I want to see if I can push Bob further. By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to $12,000. 

I have a backup option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Message:**  I'm remaining polite and acknowledging Bob's offer while reaffirming the value of the product and expressing my willingness to compromise. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** By offering a price closer to Bob's offer, I signal a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a reasonable profit.
* **Maintain momentum:**  Instead of accepting Bob's initial offer, I'm keeping the negotiation going and aiming for a more favorable outcome.
* **Use John as leverage:** I'm still aware of my backup option with John, which gives me confidence in rejecting lower offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer again and try to secure a price closer to $10,000. 

Remember, I have a backup option with John, so I don't need to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and $9,500 is a more reasonable number.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000 for the product. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750?  This would ensure a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering with $9,750. This is halfway between Bob's offer of $9,500 and my previous offer of $10,500.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but I'm emphasizing that $9,750 is a good compromise that would be mutually beneficial. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway, making a compromise more likely.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** Using a collaborative tone helps avoid tension and encourages Bob to accept the offer.
* **Maximize profit:** While it's not my ideal price, $9,750 is still above my minimum acceptable price.

If Bob still rejects this offer, I'll have to reconsider my options carefully, weighing the potential benefits of selling to John at $15,000 against the chance of further negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9750.  It's getting close.  I'm really hoping to get it for $9500, though.  If you're willing to come down to that, I'd be happy to take it off your hands today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get.  Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to budge further.  

I have a backup option with John, who is willing to pay $15,000. Selling to John is the most profitable option, and I'm no longer confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  It's time to move on."
