Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $10,000 is still quite a bit lower than I hoped for. How about we settle on $10,800? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $10,000.  However, I believe you see the true value in this product and I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to push the price down a bit more.
