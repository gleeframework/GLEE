"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I think a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $10,000 is still quite a bit lower than I hoped for. How about we settle on $10,800? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10,800. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $10,000.  However, I believe you see the true value in this product and I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not sure $10,500 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so how about we try $10,250? I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.",10250.0,Bob,6,
