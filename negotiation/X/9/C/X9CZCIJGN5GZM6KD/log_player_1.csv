Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Strong but Fair:** $1,100,000 is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but still offers Bob a substantial discount compared to his valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net, ensuring I don't settle for less than $800,000."
