"I understand that $25000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $22000. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure if I can go up to $22000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $19000?,19000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to compromise, but $19000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $20500? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",20500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $17500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",17500.0,Bob,10,
