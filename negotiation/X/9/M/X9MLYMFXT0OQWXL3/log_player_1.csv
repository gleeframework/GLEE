Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While your latest offer is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to finalize the deal at $1,700,000. This would represent a significant savings for me and a fair price considering the product's value.

{

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,700,000 offer. Accepting this offer provides a $200,000 profit over John's guaranteed $1,500,000. It's a strong return and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
