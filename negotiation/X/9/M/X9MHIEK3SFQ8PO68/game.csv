"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",250.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand that $250 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $175? That's a fair price that would allow us to both walk away happy.",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand that $175 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $185, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",185.0,Alice,5,
