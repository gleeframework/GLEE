"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's valuable, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you meet me at $750,000? It's a fair offer, and we can close this deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply isn't enough.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now.",800000.0,Alice,5,
