Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product at a price of $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while giving me a fair return. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. It's better to try to negotiate a better price with him. While I could sell to John for $800,000, I'm hoping to get closer to the $1,000,000 value Bob sees in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's valuable, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you meet me at $750,000? It's a fair offer, and we can close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $750,000 is closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping to get closer to $850,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply isn't enough.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 800000}
