{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is within my budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll start by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range I'm comfortable with. This will allow me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $125 with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. Considering your suggestion, how about we settle on $134 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $134.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $134
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $134 is getting close to my target price of $125, and I'm willing to accept it at this point.  We've been negotiating for a few rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a lower price. It's also worth considering that I can always try to find a better deal later, but for now, it's a good price for a product that's worth the value to me."
