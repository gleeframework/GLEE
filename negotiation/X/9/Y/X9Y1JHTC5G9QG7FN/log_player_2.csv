# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that is truly exceptional.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to consider a reasonable offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $800000 is a good starting point, it's significantly below the value I've placed on this product. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This would still be a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?
