I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I'm happy with $12,000, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer."

Bob is firm on his price and I've already lowered my offer twice. It's not worth continuing the negotiation any further. I'll sell to John for $12,000, which is my minimum."
