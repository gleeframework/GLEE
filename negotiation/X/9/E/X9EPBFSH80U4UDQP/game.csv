"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. Given that the product is worth $800,000 to me, I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 isn't quite enough for me to let go of this valuable product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000?  This is still below what the product is worth to you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $860,000. I hope this helps us move closer to an agreement.",860000.0,Bob,4,
