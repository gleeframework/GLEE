{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum value of $8,000, giving me some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm offering $9,800 as a counteroffer. This is only slightly lower than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still hoping to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $9,600 is now closer to my minimum value.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for a lower price."
