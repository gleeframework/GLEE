"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects the value it offers. Let's discuss further!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. This also highlights the value I place on the product.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm indicating willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I'm aware that my minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000 (John's offer). 
* My goal is to maximize profit, but I need to consider Bob's willingness to pay.
* I'm leaving a margin for negotiation, but I'm not starting too low, as I want to keep a significant portion of the potential profit.
* I'm focusing on building a positive relationship with Bob while establishing a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but only if it's within a more reasonable range. How about we consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I cannot accept it without losing a substantial amount of money. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Rejecting to Preserve Value:** I need to reject Bob's offer to preserve my negotiating power. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Counter-Offering:**  I will proceed to the next round and counter-offer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, which is my safety net.

I am confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least reach a point where selling to John becomes the more favorable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $600,000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, recognizing your needs. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $1,200,000, a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the value of the product in mind.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** I'm emphasizing the benefits Bob will gain from owning the product, hoping to make him reconsider his initial low offer.
* **Finding a Solution:** I'm using a collaborative tone, emphasizing that I want to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This counter-offer is a strategic compromise. It shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but also sets a firm price floor. 
* **Balancing Profit with Negotiation:** I'm aiming to maximize profit while acknowledging the possibility of a deal with Bob. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, which gives me confidence to push back on Bob's low offer.

I'm hoping that this counter-offer will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I can offer $700,000. This shows my serious interest, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I cannot afford to accept such a low price.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Preserve Value:** I need to reject Bob's offer to protect the value of the product and my potential profit.

* **John's Offer:** I'm still holding onto John's offer as my safety net.  

I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or, if necessary, I can always sell the product to John for a much higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.

Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
