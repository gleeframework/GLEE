"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects the value it offers. Let's discuss further!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but only if it's within a more reasonable range. How about we consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $600,000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, recognizing your needs. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I can offer $700,000. This shows my serious interest, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that still allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for me. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, but it also reflects the value I place on this product and on our potential partnership. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
