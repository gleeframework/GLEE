"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your business operations and contribute to your success. Given its exceptional value and potential impact on your endeavors, I am confident it would be an invaluable asset to you.

Considering its intrinsic worth and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $1,250,000 for this opportunity. This figure strikes a balance between reflecting the product's true value and ensuring a fair transaction for both parties.

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and financial planning. I am more than willing to discuss further details or negotiate within reason to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is lower than your maximum budget, but it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity to negotiate a lower price. Alice knows you have another option and might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
