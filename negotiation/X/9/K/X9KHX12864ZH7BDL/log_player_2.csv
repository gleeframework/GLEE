"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. It's clear there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and see if I can bring the price down significantly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a much lower offer to see how Alice reacts and to leave room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get the price as close to my $120 limit as possible, knowing I can always go up or buy from John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 is my starting point, I could come down to $170.  I believe this product offers significant value, even at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice came down a bit, but $170 is still too high for me. It seems like there's some wiggle room, so I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $170 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm inching closer to my maximum budget, but I'm still trying to leave room for negotiation. By proposing a price between her last offer and mine, I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying but need her to move closer to my range."
