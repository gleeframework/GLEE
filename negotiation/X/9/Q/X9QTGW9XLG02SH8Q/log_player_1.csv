"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our two offers. How about $1,400,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting closer.  While $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,150,000 if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While $1,150,000 is less than ideal, we're still in early rounds. Holding firm for a few more rounds might push him closer to $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'll come down to $1,325,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $1,325,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be open to considering $1,200,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the halfway point in the negotiation. While $1,200,000 is tempting, holding out for one more round might push Bob closer to $1,250,000.  We can signal this is our final offer to add pressure."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, but I need to be transparent â€“ this is my final offer. I believe it's more than fair and reflects the true value of this product. Let me know your decision."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,225,000 for the product. If you're unable to accept that, I understand, but I'm also mindful of other options available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, we've reached a critical point in the negotiation. Bob has signaled this is his absolute maximum by mentioning ""other options."" Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting $1,225,000 is a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
