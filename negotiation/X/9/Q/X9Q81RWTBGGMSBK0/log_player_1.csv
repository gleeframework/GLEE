I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my goal."

I've decided to sell to John. While I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price from Bob, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can reach a deal with Bob that's significantly better than what John is offering."
