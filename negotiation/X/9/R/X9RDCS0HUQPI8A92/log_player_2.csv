# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum price and what John offers. You can save $200,000 by going with John."
