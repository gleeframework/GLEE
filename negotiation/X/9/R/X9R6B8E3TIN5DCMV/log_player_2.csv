{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is $850,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $950,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's still higher than Alice's value for the product. It allows room for further bargaining while still being a fair price for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer, but still within a reasonable range. However, I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives me another opportunity to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $900,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but still leaves some room for further bargaining.  It also shows that I'm serious about acquiring the product, but not at any price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm still not happy with the price. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a middle ground.  It's worth trying to save even a small amount of money by rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is $930,000.  It's a compromise, offering a higher price than my previous counteroffer but still significantly less than Alice's offer.  With each round, we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I believe Alice will be tempted to accept this offer as it's closer to her desired price range and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now above my initial maximum budget, but it's still much less than what I'd pay John. Since I'm still within my negotiation rounds, I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'm also considering the possibility that Alice might be willing to lower her price if I continue to reject her offers and show that I'm not afraid to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  It's still a good deal for me, as it's well under my maximum budget. I believe Alice will be tempted to accept this offer, as it's closer to her desired price range and we are running out of negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is approaching my maximum budget, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  We're down to the final round of negotiation, and it's possible that Alice might be willing to accept a lower price rather than risk losing the deal altogether. By rejecting her offer, I can make one final counteroffer and try to get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. It's still a significant amount of money for me, but it's the highest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's closer to her desired price range and we're at the end of the negotiation process. If she rejects it, I'll have to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is a much less favorable outcome."
