"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high benchmark and gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to see if Bob is truly interested in purchasing it at a premium price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a better deal in the next round. It's a risk, but I believe in the value of my product and I don't want to settle for less than what I believe it's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my desired range. I'm feeling the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm determined to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation isn't going as well as I hoped. Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm worried about getting stuck with a deal that isn't worth it. To avoid risking a further price drop or a stalled negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a guaranteed sale and I'm confident that I can find a better buyer for my next product."
