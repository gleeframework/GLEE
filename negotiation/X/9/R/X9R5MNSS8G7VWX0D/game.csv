"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be able to consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is significantly lower than what I need to sell this product. I'm willing to come down to $120. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While $120 is still a bit out of my budget, I would like to propose $95 as a potential compromise. I hope this aligns better with your needs.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $107.50? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while still staying within your budget.",107.5,Alice,5,
