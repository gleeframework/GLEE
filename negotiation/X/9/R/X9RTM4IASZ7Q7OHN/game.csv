"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its true value.  Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $750,000 is still not a price I can accept. To show you my willingness to meet halfway, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value, and it's a step closer to where I need to be. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to pay $820,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",820000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $820,000 is almost there, but I'm still a little ways off my target.  I'm willing to come down to $830,000,  which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer. Let's make a deal.",830000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $820,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer.",820000.0,Bob,8,
