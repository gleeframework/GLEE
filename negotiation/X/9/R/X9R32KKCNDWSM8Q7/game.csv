"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $13,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work. How about $9,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to be flexible, but $9,000 is significantly below the market value for a product of this caliber.  How about we meet halfway at $11,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still too high for me. Let's compromise and try $9,500. This is a reasonable price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",9500.0,Bob,4,
