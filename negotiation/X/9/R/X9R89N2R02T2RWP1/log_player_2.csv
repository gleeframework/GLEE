You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from her valuation of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. This doesn't mean you won't buy from her, but it opens the door for a counter-offer closer to her valuation and your budget."
