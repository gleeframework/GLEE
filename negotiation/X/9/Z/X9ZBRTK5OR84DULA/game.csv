"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I know it's even more valuable to you. Let's start with a price of $1,450,000.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 isn't quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,400,000 is the lowest I can go. This product is truly unique and worth a premium. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,400,000, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting a sense we're close to an agreement.  How about we split the difference at $1,350,000? This would allow me to reach my goal, while still leaving you a valuable product at a great price. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,7,
