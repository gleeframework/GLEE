Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still fair for both of us and reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a little further to $825,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for this product. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal for me. Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John, as I can still get my minimum desired price."
