"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still fair for both of us and reflects the product's true worth.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a little further to $825,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique value of this product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for this product. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",800000.0,Bob,6,
