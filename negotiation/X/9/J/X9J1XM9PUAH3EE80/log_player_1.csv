{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay closer to my minimum. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $150. I'll counter with a higher offer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to undervalue the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet at $120. My maximum budget remains $100. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to compromise further, and I don't see any chance of him coming up to my desired price.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $150."
