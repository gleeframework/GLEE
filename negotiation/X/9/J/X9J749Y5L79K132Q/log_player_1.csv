{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm highlighting the potential value the product has for Bob to incentivize him to consider the offer.
* **Mention alternative buyer:** While I don't explicitly state John's offer, I subtly imply I have other options, which might increase Bob's urgency to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob is willing to pay a premium, which indicates there's room for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffering is strategic:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my target price range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. This shows I'm willing to be flexible but still protects my interests.
* **Maintain value:**  $1,050,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Focus on benefits for Bob:**  I remind Bob that this is still a great deal for him, highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $950,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and increase his offer. There's a chance he might be willing to go higher.
* **Controlling the negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I retain control over the negotiation process and can potentially secure a better price.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This gives you a significant price advantage over what you initially offered, and it allows me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm offering a slight concession from my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility while staying above Bob's current offer. 
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm highlighting the benefits of the deal for Bob, emphasizing the ""significant price advantage"" over his initial offer.
* **Urgency:**  I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting a ""fair compromise"" and stating my willingness to ""make this deal happen.""

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiations moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $925,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.
* **Time is money:** Continued negotiation with Bob is consuming time and resources, potentially delaying a sale and impacting my profits.
* **Guaranteed return:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, ensuring a substantial return on my investment. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John to secure the best possible outcome for myself."
