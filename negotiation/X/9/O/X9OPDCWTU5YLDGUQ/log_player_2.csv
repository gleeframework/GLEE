"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking to sell it to you for a price that reflects its value to me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my maximum, but I can do better.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $750,000 price point. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still above my target.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $800,000?  That way we're both getting a fair price."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the $800,000 price point. As I mentioned earlier, the product's value to me is $800,000, so I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than that. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $825,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is close to my target of $800,000.  I've already rejected two of her offers, and at this point, it's likely she won't go lower.  It's in my best interest to accept the offer and save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
