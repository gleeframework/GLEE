Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $11,000.  This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable price.
