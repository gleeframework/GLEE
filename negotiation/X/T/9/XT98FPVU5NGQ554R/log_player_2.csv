# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1200000 for the product.

This reflects its value to me while giving you a fair profit margin. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1130000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1180000 and $1130000, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My next offer is $1155000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to come down in price, she's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You've only got three rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get her down to your target price within that timeframe.  With John's offer, you have a guaranteed way to acquire the product at your desired price. It's a safer and more efficient move to accept John's offer."
