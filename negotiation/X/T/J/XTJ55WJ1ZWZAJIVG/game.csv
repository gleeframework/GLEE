"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,250? That's the best I can do, and I hope it's something you can work with.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference one last time.  How about $9,375? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. ",9375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,375. I've already stretched my budget quite far, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to make one final offer: $9,000. That's the absolute limit for me. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
