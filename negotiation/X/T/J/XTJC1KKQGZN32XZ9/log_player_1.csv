I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This leaves a good margin for me, but also offers a good value to Bob, as it's still lower than what the product is worth to him.  This initial offer is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my desired price while still providing Bob with a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm willing to accept it at this point. While I'd prefer more, this offer provides a decent profit and is the best outcome available at this time."
