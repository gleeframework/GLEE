"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've done some research and I think it's a bit overpriced at $12,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
