"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target of $1,000,000.  It's best to try and negotiate a better price. There are still 9 rounds left to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your target of $1,000,000. There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a lower price.  You can potentially get a better deal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,120,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, it's still not within your desired range. You have five rounds left to negotiate. If you continue to reject, there's a good chance Alice will continue to lower her price, ultimately getting you a better deal.  You can always choose to buy from John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,120,000. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
