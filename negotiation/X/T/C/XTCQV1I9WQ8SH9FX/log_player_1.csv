Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a good deal while still being fair to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're already making a profit of $4,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's not too aggressive:** This price is less likely to make Bob immediately reject the offer. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and see if you can push for a higher price while still leaving room to make a deal."
