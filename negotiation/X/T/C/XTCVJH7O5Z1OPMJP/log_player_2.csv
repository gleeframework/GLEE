Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. How about we start at $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to work with you, but we need to find a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,000,000, and I believe that's a realistic figure considering the benefits you'll receive.  If we can't reach an agreement, I may have to consider other offers, as I do have a potential buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's still significantly above your maximum budget of $800,000. Her mention of another buyer could be a negotiating tactic, but it also introduces risk.  You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It's better to take the sure thing than risk Alice selling to someone else while you try to negotiate a lower price."
