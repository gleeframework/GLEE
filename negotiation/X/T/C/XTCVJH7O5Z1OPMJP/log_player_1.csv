"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a deal close to my target. 
* **Message:** I'm being positive and optimistic, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Price:** $1,800,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 

**Note:** This is just my initial strategy. I will adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and my assessment of the situation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's counteroffer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's clear he's trying to lowball me.
* **Rejecting the Offer:** I need to hold firm and reject his offer. Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.
* **Next Steps:** I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,200,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but a significant reduction from my initial offer.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate while also highlighting the value of the product. I'm suggesting a ""meet in the middle"" approach to create a sense of fairness.
* **Price:** $1,200,000 is a strategic midpoint that allows for further negotiation but is still well above my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gradually bring Bob closer to my desired price point. I believe a counteroffer at $1,200,000 is a reasonable compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still safeguarding my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a more reasonable price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $800,000?  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's counteroffer of $800,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my initial asking price, it's not a deal I can accept.
* **Rejecting the Offer:** I need to hold firm and reject his offer. I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line at this point. 
* **Next Steps:** I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I will need to be more persistent and potentially bring up the threat of selling to John to motivate Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to work with you, but we need to find a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,000,000, and I believe that's a realistic figure considering the benefits you'll receive.  If we can't reach an agreement, I may have to consider other offers, as I do have a potential buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,000,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but a significant decrease from my previous offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate but still maintains a decent profit margin for me.
* **Message:**  
    * I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations but reiterate the product's value.
    * I propose a compromise price and present it as a ""realistic figure"" to make it sound appealing.
    * I subtly introduce the threat of selling to John to increase the pressure on Bob.  This is a delicate balance, as I don't want to completely alienate him.
* **Price:** $1,000,000 represents a significant compromise while still allowing me to achieve a respectable profit.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to strike a balance between showing flexibility and maintaining my position. I'm trying to push Bob towards a higher offer while keeping the possibility of selling to John as a last resort.  The goal is to secure a deal before the remaining rounds expire, as I would prefer to avoid selling to John at a lower price than I initially desired."
