Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start the negotiation with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($10,000). 
* **Justification:**  While a simple ""take it or leave it"" approach might work, briefly mentioning the product's value to Bob can make him more receptive to the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and suggests willingness to negotiate, indicated by the question ""What do you think?"".

This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping your options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches his perceived value, it's the same amount John is offering. There's no downside to attempting further negotiation with Bob to see if you can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe this product is worth more than that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,000?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting ""meeting halfway,"" you show a willingness to negotiate and make concessions. 
* **Strong Position:**  You're still significantly above Bob's offer, but the compromise might make him more open.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges how much Bob is willing to budge. If he accepts, you get a profit above John's offer. If he rejects it, you have more information for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, my budget is still limited to $10,000. I'm sorry if my previous offers didn't reflect that clearly. Would it be possible for us to agree on $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has reiterated his maximum budget of $10,000 twice. It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **No Upside:** Continuing negotiations with Bob has no real benefit. You risk losing time and potentially John's offer without any guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer is guaranteed and matches Bob's final offer. 

It's time to cut your losses and secure a sale at the price you know you can get."
