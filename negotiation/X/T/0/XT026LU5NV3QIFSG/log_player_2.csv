"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's product is worth $100 to her, so I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a bit more than her value. This gives me a starting point for negotiation without immediately being too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  There's still a chance I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's most recent offer. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay at this point. I'm confident that I can get a lower price if I continue negotiating. The offer is also very close to what I would pay John, so I'm not ready to give in yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time I'm matching Alice's previous offer. This signals that I'm willing to compromise and meet her halfway. It's also a good strategy to show her that I'm serious about buying the product and that we're close to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, I'm still determined to try and get a better price. I've already made a counteroffer at $120, which is only $15 less than this offer. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but this time only by $5. This shows that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but I'm still trying to get a better price than her last offer. With only a few rounds left, I'm pushing to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than what I'm willing to pay, and we're in the final round of negotiation.  It's no longer worth risking another counteroffer that might be rejected, potentially leaving me with no product.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $150, which is within my budget, it's the best option to ensure I get the product."
