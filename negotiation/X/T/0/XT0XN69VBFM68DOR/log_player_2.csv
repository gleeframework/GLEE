"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal and I think you'll really like it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is closer to my budget, I should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, which might signal that I'm willing to walk away. However, it leaves room for further negotiation before reaching my maximum budget or going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John at the same price."
