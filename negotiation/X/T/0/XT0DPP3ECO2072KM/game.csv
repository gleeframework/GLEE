"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to earn a significant portion of its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose an alternative offer of $950,000. This price still allows me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost while staying within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing negotiations, $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still represents a significant value for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer and, despite the improvement, I'm still not able to meet the $1,100,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1,050,000. This price is higher than my initial budget, but it's the best I can offer while staying within my financial constraints. I hope this proposal will be more in line with what you're considering.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price would allow me to make a decent profit while still offering you a fair deal. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued efforts, Alice. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept the $1,150,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1,100,000. This price is closer to what I can afford while still allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope this revised offer will be more in line with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
