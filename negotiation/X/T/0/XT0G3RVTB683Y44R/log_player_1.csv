Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.

I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet. I believe I can get closer to my target price."

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum. It's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation or losing the deal to John."
