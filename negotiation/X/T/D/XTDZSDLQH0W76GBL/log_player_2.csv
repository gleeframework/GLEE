Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping for a lower price.  $92 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we try $89.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 89.5}

Round 7
