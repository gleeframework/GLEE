{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$140 price:** This is a good starting point, it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly message:** Establishing a positive tone can help keep the negotiation amicable and increase the chances of a deal. 

I'm starting with a higher price to see if I can secure a good deal. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not in a rush to sell, and I believe I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise language:**  Phrases like ""split the difference"" can make the counteroffer seem more reasonable. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation productive.

I believe $135 is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll have to reassess my options, keeping in mind John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has repeatedly stuck to his $130 price, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While further negotiation is possible, it's likely to be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower final price.

Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's more efficient and less risky to sell to him.  I'll secure my desired profit without the hassle of extended negotiations."
