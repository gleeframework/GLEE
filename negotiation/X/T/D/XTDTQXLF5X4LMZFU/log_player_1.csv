"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price above Bob's perceived value to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $1,750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, allowing for potential concessions.
* **Positive and Enthusiastic:** A positive tone encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **I have room to negotiate.** I'm still within the early rounds, and I can likely get a better price by counter-offering.
* **Selling to John is an option.** I have the safety net of selling to John for my minimum price if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to reflect your enthusiasm. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and our shared desire for a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to show I'm open to negotiating.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, how about $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** Even though it's closer, $1,400,000 is still less than my $1,500,000 floor.
* **We're nearing the middle ground.**  I have room to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is a viable option.** If negotiations stall, selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm eager to make this deal work.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both get a good deal.  Let's close this transaction!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous price and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  I'm highlighting my willingness to compromise to show I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's close this transaction!"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Still above my Minimum:**  While close, I'm still above my minimum desired price, so I'm not giving away too much."
