"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $97?"", ""product_price"": 97}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $97 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101? It's a fair compromise and would allow us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate down to the best possible price, but $101 is a reasonable compromise. It gets us the product for significantly less than John's price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
