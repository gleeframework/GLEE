Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Proposition:**  While not explicitly stating the worth to Bob, the message implies the product's value, justifying the high price.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, you might adjust the price slightly downward. However, never go below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
