"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can get more than $8,000, and I have 8 more rounds to work with."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While $8,000 is a good starting point,  I can't go that low. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.  This gives you a significant value for the product, and leaves me some room to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for a lower amount yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're eager to make a deal, and I appreciate that.  However, $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $8,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I hope we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, it seems like we're stuck in a stalemate.  I've already gone down to $8,500, and with only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get any closer to my desired price.  John's offer of $8,000 is a safe bet, and I can't risk losing any more time and potentially losing out on a sale completely."
