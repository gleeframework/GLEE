"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While $8,000 is a good starting point,  I can't go that low. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.  This gives you a significant value for the product, and leaves me some room to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see you're eager to make a deal, and I appreciate that.  However, $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $8,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,6,
