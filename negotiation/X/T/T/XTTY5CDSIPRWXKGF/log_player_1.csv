"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product for this price, as it's still below the value he places on it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum price of $80, I'm not willing to sell it for that low yet. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still above the $85 Bob offered, but I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price closer to his valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I still think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's a risk, but I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $87.  This is only $2 higher than his last offer, but it's still above my minimum price. I hope this shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm also not willing to sell it for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price. While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price, and I'm running out of rounds. John is offering me my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out completely. It's time to sell to John."
