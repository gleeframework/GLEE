"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  I believe it's a win-win situation, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's, meaning there's no advantage to buying from Alice.  As Bob's goal is to save money, he should reject the offer and explore other options. There might be a chance to negotiate with John or find another seller offering a better price."
