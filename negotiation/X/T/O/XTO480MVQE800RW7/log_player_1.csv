"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the value and exclusivity of the product to try and sway him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,100,000. This product is truly one-of-a-kind, and I believe that price reflects its value. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I believe that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you see it as a sign of my commitment to finding a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not sure if $1,050,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision, as $975,000 is very close to my minimum value.  However, we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price from Bob.  Considering John is willing to pay $1,000,000, it makes more sense to sell to him at this point and guarantee that profit."
