"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation.  I want to explore if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a significant jump from Alice's initial price but still leaves room for further negotiation.  This demonstrates my willingness to deal but also sets a clear expectation that I won't accept a price drastically lower than my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $1000000. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still not ready to commit.  I'm aiming to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible.  I want to see if she'll budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for that $1,000,000 mark.  How about we split the difference at $975,000?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price, but I'm also being reasonable by suggesting a midpoint between our current offers. This shows good faith while still working toward my goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still looking to spend closer to $1000000. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $975000. I'm willing to offer you a revised price of $975050. This is as close as I can get to your target price while still ensuring I get a good deal for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and while I'm still $25,000 off my target, the difference is small enough that it's worth accepting her offer.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's within my budget."
