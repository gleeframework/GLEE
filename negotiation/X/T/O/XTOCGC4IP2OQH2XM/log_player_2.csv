"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is still too close to John's price.
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.**  By rejecting, you show Alice you're serious about getting a better deal. This opens the door for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.**  While it's closer to your target price, you can likely do better.
* **Continuing to negotiate is worthwhile.** By rejecting, you maintain pressure on Alice to lower her price further. You're still within range of a good deal, and there's no need to rush into a purchase yet."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
