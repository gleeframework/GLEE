"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $15,000 is too high for my budget.  I would be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could we possibly agree on $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go down to $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",9000.0,Alice,5,
