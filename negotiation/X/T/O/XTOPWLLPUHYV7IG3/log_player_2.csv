Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go down to $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $9,000, and you have a guaranteed option at $8,000 with John."
