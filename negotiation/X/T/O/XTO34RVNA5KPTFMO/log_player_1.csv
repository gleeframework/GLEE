Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but also significantly below Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to accept.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm going to split the difference between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer.  Hopefully this will be appealing enough to Bob, but still leaves me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. At this point, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While it's not ideal, it's still a reasonable outcome."
