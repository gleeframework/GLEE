I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly better than selling to John.  It seems Bob is firm on his price and I don't want to risk further negotiation leading to a lower price or even losing the sale."
