"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $11,500 is still above his budget, and he has 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That would be a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate further. He has 7 more rounds to try and get a better deal, and there's always the option to buy from John if he's unsuccessful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  However, I'm still a bit over my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,750?  I'm confident this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,900. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,900 is very close to his budget, he has 5 more rounds to try and get a better deal. He can try to negotiate further or, if he's unsuccessful, buy from John for $10,000. There's no need to settle now when he might be able to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,800? It's a fair compromise that would allow me to purchase the product while still staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,950. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  

Here's why:

* **Alice's price is still above Bob's budget:** While $10,950 is close, it's still over Bob's maximum of $10,000.
* **Only 3 rounds left:**  There's not much room for negotiation with only 3 rounds remaining.  It's unlikely Alice will drop her price significantly enough in that time. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John has already offered a price that's within Bob's budget, and there's no risk of John changing his mind.

It's better for Bob to lock in a deal with John and avoid the possibility of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer, potentially leaving him with no purchase in the last round."
