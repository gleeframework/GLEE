"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too far below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference. I'll come down to $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're on a tight budget, but $750,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $800,000 is my final offer.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree.  If not, I'll have to consider other offers.  Let me know what you decide.",800000.0,Alice,5,
