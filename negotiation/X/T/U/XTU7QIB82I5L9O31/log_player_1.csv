``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to potentially get a good profit, but also low enough to leave some room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm also leaving the door open to selling to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $700,000, I'm confident I can get more.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While $750,000 is getting closer to a deal, it's still not enough for me.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll be prepared to sell to John if this doesn't work out.  I need to maximize my profit."
