"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.** You're willing to pay $1,200,000 max, and her offer is $900,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice's offer is still quite high, and you can try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If the negotiation fails, you can always buy from John, but it's better to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum value. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial counteroffer will see how flexible Alice is and if she's willing to meet you halfway. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can still increase your offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

* **There's still room to negotiate further.** Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price from $900,000 to $850,000.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.** You have time to negotiate further and avoid paying John's higher price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Close to her minimum value:**  $800,000 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's her minimum acceptable price.
* **Creating urgency:** By offering a price close to her minimum, it might encourage Alice to accept to avoid further negotiations."
