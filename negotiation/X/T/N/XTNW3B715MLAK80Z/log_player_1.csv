"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a strong opening offer. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, I'll offer it to him for $900,000. This is a good starting point, and I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate from here.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's counteroffer is a significant reduction from his initial valuation of $1,200,000. However, it's still lower than my initial asking price of $900,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer that's higher than his offer, but lower than my initial asking price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. This will give me some room for negotiation and potentially get closer to the product's value to Bob.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $800,000 is now at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and it's also the price I could get from selling to John. I'll reject Bob's offer and sell the product to John, as it's the best option for me now.
