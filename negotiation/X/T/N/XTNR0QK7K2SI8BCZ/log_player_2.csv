"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $16,000. I believe it's a fair reflection of what it can do for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. Would you consider $6,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I hope it shows how serious I am about purchasing this product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. $7,000 is too low.  Let's settle at $12,000, my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her value of $12,000.  This means she is unlikely to go any lower. Since your maximum budget is $8,000 and you have the option to buy from John at that price, it's better to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
