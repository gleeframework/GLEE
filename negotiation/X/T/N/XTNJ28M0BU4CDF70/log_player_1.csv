I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum value.  I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I still think I can get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than what Bob offered.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a good amount above my minimum value. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and ending up selling to John for less."
