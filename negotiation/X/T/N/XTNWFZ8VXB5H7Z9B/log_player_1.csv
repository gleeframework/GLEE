Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate but is still a significant profit above his perceived value. 
* **Don't Price Yourself Out:**  While you could try a price closer to $15,000, it risks Bob immediately rejecting the offer and going with a competitor. 

This strategy aims for a quick and profitable sale while balancing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
