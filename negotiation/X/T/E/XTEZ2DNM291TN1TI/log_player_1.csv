"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""message"": ""Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000.  This is a very reasonable offer given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 17000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I have to be honest, $15,250 is pushing it for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I have a budget to stick to.  My final offer is $14,000.
