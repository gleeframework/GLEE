"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000.  This is a very reasonable offer given the product's worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $15,250?  That's my final offer.",15250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I have to be honest, $15,250 is pushing it for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I have a budget to stick to.  My final offer is $14,000.",14000.0,Bob,6,
