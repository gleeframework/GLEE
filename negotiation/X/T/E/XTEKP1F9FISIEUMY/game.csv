"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $750,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves you with a good value for the product.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm getting closer, but $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
