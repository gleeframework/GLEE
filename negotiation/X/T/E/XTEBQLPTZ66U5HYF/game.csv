"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  my initial asking price reflects the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,200,000. How about we try $1,400,000? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
