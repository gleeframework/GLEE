"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1500000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, $1500000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, reflecting a significant reduction from my initial offer. This gives you a good price point, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to close this deal!",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to counter with $1600000. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1600000 still falls short of my expectations.  I'm willing to compromise further, and offer you the product for $1650000.  This represents a reasonable compromise, and allows for both of us to walk away with a positive outcome. What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $1625000 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to a final agreement.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to go a little lower, but $1625000 is still not quite there for me. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1640000. It's a fair price, and it reflects the value we both recognize in this product. Let's make this happen!",1640000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I've made some adjustments based on our negotiations. I would like to propose $1630000 as a counteroffer. I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1630000.0,Bob,8,
