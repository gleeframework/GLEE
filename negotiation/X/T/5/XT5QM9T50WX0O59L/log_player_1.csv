Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept from John. This is to see if Bob is willing to pay more than he initially valued the product at.  I am hoping to get a counteroffer from him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than what I'm willing to accept from John. This is to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has not met my price expectations, and while I'm willing to negotiate, it seems like he is unwilling to go higher than $90.  I am going to sell the product to John to ensure a guaranteed $100, which is still above my minimum selling point."
