"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're aiming to save money, accepting Alice's offer right away is not the best strategy. It's worth exploring the negotiation process to see if you can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This establishes your willingness to negotiate and creates room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to your desired price, it's still not the best deal possible.  Continuing the negotiation could lead to an even lower price, especially since you've already demonstrated your willingness to bargain. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise. It's higher than your previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest offer, demonstrating your willingness to meet halfway. This approach increases the chances of Alice accepting and reaching a deal."
