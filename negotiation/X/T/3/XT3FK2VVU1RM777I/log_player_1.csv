Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and it's worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a fair price for both sides:**  It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but higher than your minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might want to go lower, and you can adjust accordingly.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** This encourages Bob to engage in the process. 

Let me know what Bob's response is, and we can continue from there!"
