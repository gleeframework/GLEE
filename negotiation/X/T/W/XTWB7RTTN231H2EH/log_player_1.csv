Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm optimistic about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."

Round 2

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $13,200 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,400? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13400} 
```"
