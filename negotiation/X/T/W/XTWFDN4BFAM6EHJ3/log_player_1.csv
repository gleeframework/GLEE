Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it's something that could really benefit you. I'm asking for $950,000, which reflects its true value and potential."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's potential to get even more from Bob.
* **High but reasonable starting point:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strong value proposition:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""true value and potential"", subtly justifying the high price.

**Goal:**

The goal is to anchor Bob's perception of the price at a high point. Even if he rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for a potential counter-offer closer to Alice's desired range.  Worst case, she has the guaranteed sale to John."
