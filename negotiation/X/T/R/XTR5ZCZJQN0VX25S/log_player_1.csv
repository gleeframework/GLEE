"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you, given the product's value. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is above my minimum, and it's a fair compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $1,200,000, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
