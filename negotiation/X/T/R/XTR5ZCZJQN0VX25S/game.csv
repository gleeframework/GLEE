"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you, given the product's value. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
