"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, leaving room for potential compromise.  It's important to start high and see if Bob is willing to meet you in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price, but I'm not going to risk settling for too low of a price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility, but still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired value. This encourages Bob to continue negotiating without dropping too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far from my desired price.  I believe I can squeeze out a bit more, especially considering I have more rounds to negotiate. Selling to John would only net me $1,000,000, while Bob's offer is slightly higher, leaving room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
```

I'm again lowering my price slightly, continuing to show flexibility while keeping the offer above Bob's last counteroffer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
