Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll sell for no less than $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 if Bob refuses.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, which means getting as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. However, being too greedy could make Bob reject the offer.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,400,000 is a significant profit margin for you while still leaving Bob with a potential $100,000 gain (his value - your price).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly implies that Bob could miss out if he doesn't act.
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" reinforces the product's desirability.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a two-way street. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but always keep your $1,200,000 minimum in mind."
