"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1600000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to think about my own costs. I can offer it to you for $1650000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but no more. Can you meet me at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
