"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000.  This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $16,000.  How about $15,500? This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
