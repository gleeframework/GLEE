Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,500,000 (her guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for the highest price Bob is willing to pay while ensuring she gets more than John's offer. A price slightly below Bob's maximum value would be ideal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I think it could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm willing to make a special offer of $995,000 for you. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Why this works:**

* **Attractive to Bob:** $995,000 is just under Bob's perceived value, making it highly appealing.
* **Profitable for Alice:**  Alice secures a profit of $495,000 over her minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  While this offer is likely to be successful, there's no guarantee Bob will accept. There's always a chance he might try to negotiate further or decline the offer."
