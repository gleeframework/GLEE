"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. After careful consideration, I am offering you the chance to purchase this item at a special price of $1,350,000. This represents a significant value proposition compared to its worth of $1,200,000 to you, and it allows us to strike a fair deal. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing this further or if you have any questions about the product. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly less than the product's worth to you, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John at your target price."
