"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and potentially set a high baseline for the negotiation. 
* It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially considering I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000. 
* I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* I'm trying to find a middle ground while still securing a price closer to my minimum value.
*  It's important to note that I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to offer prices below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

*  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
*  I've already made a significant compromise in the previous round, and Bob's offer shows he's not willing to meet my needs. 
*  To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed profit, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This secures a profitable sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
