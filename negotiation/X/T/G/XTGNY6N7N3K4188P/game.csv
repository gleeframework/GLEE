"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, but to give you a great deal, I'm willing to start the negotiation at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This is a very fair offer.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $11,500. How about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is still too low. Let's make this work - how about $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
