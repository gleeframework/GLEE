"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems quite high. I'm interested in the product but could only consider purchasing it for a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a solution that works for both of us. This is a significant reduction and I believe it reflects my commitment to making this deal happen.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still much higher than what I had in mind. I could potentially consider $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
