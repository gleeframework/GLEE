"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 again, but this time, I'll throw in a small bonus that's worth $250. So, the total value you'll get is $9,250. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better one elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the bonus offer, but I'm still trying to keep my costs down.  $8,750 is the absolute maximum I can spend.  If you're willing to go that low, we can close the deal now.  Otherwise, I might need to consider other options.",8750.0,Bob,6,
