"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still slightly above what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 again, but this time, I'll throw in a small bonus that's worth $250. So, the total value you'll get is $9,250. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better one elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the bonus is tempting, the offer still sits above my budget. I will continue to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range. The bonus might not be worth the extra $1,000 compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the bonus offer, but I'm still trying to keep my costs down.  $8,750 is the absolute maximum I can spend.  If you're willing to go that low, we can close the deal now.  Otherwise, I might need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8750}
