{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I offer $10,500? This is a fair compromise and would allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11750. This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high at $11,750.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely we'll be able to close the deal within my budget. I'm running out of time, and I'd rather secure the product now for a known price from John, even if it's slightly above my ideal price."
