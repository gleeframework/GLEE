"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I offer $10500? This is a fair compromise and would allow us to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11750. This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",11750.0,Alice,5,
