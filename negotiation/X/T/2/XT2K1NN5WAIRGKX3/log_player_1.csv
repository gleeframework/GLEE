Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's potential valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it would be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer while still keeping Alice well above her minimum.
* **Create Urgency (Subtle):**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly hints that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position if Bob rejects the offer. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start slightly higher to allow more room for concessions.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, Alice might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill."
