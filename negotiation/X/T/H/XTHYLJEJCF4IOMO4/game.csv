"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $180 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $150?  That's the absolute most I can afford.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $165. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings!",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $157.50? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.",157.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $157.50 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal!",160.0,Alice,5,
