"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $8,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
