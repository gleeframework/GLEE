"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $950,000 is still too high for Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get a good deal quickly.  He's offering $850,000, which is still within his budget but a significant drop from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still within Bob's budget and a decent price.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price but also risks Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for the full $800,000.  It's a good compromise to accept this offer."
