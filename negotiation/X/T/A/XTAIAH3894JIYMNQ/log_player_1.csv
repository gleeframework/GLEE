Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer aims to strike a balance: 

* **It's above your minimum of $80**, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value of $100**, giving him room to negotiate but still leaving a decent margin for you. 
* **The friendly message creates a positive atmosphere**, which could encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while also setting a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's worth trying to get closer to your target price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer slightly higher than Bob's:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but not drastically lower your price.
* **Fairness language:**  Mentioning a ""fair price"" can appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and avoids tension.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between your desired price and Bob's offer, while still maintaining your negotiation leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. How about $88?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $88 is still below your ideal price, but it's only $2 away from your minimum acceptable price of $80.  Furthermore, he's emphasizing a ""fair price"" and finality, suggesting that further negotiation might not yield a better outcome.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale and avoid the risk of Bob backing out or the potential for further negotiation to lead to a lower price."
