Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a fantastic price considering its worth, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $18,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
* **Confidence:** The message expresses confidence in the product's value and aims to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware of John's offer and can walk away if Bob isn't willing to pay a price I find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is quite limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to around $10000? I believe that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can find a compromise.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum price. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Negotiation Mindset:**  The message conveys a willingness to continue negotiating, encouraging Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a price that aligns with my budget. Could we possibly agree on $12000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Need for Further Negotiation:**  There's no need to risk lowering the price further, as this offer is already at my minimum.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting the offer saves time and avoids further negotiation rounds. 
* **Equally Viable Option:** John's offer is also for $12,000, making both options financially equal."
