Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and based on my understanding of its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John, she can start with a significantly higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Simply stating a high number isn't enough. Alice's message hints at the product's ""significant value"" and ""potential,"" subtly justifying the higher price.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence about the product's worth can influence Bob's perception of its value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  If Alice has any insight into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), she might adjust her initial offer and messaging.
* **Market information:** While not explicitly stated, knowing if similar products have sold for more than $800,000 would strengthen Alice's position.

**This initial offer is a starting point.  Alice should be prepared to:**

* **Negotiate:** Bob is likely to counter-offer, and Alice needs to be ready to adjust her price while still aiming to maximize her profit.
* **Walk away:**  If Bob's offers remain too low, Alice has the security of John's offer."
