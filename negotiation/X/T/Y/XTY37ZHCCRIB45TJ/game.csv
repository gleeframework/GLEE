"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my offer?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This offer reflects the product's true value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $13,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,800? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",12800.0,Bob,4,
