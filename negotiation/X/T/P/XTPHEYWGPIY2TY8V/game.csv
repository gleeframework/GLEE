"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to get a bit more out of the deal. How about we compromise at $108?",108.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. I'm still looking for a better deal, though.  $105 is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $108, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal, though - I'll include a free accessory that's worth $20. So, the total value you'll get is $128. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",108.0,Alice,7,
