Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $11000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our perspectives. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise, Alice. However, based on my assessment, I am unable to agree to $11000. I would like to propose a price of $10500. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our respective valuations of the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
