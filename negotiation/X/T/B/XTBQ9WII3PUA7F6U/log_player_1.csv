"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,500.  Would you be willing to go down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $13,500. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 14000}
