Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $1,100,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party waiting."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $1,200,000 (John's price), the goal is to maximize profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""another interested party"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a higher price and the risk of him rejecting the offer, leading you to sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
