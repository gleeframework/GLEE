"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
