"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to his ideal value. This shows that he's serious about buying but wants a fair price.  It's important to leave some room for negotiation, as Alice is unlikely to accept the first offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $13,250 is lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much as possible while still showing willingness to negotiate. He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating flexibility. This compromise might be appealing to Alice and could lead to a successful deal."
