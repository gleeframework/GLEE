"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the price in Bob's mind at a higher point, giving you more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""true worth,"" we subtly imply the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial price is high enough that it allows for several rounds of negotiation, letting us gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option (John):**  Having John as a backup buyer gives us a strong position. We can afford to be firm in our negotiations with Bob, knowing we have a guaranteed sale at our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to our acceptable range, it's still significantly below our aspirational target. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and John's offer provides a safety net. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  We demonstrate we're not desperate to sell at any price.
* **Guide the Negotiation Upwards:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we value the product higher and encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round. 
* **Time is on Our Side:** With eight rounds remaining, we have ample time to bridge the gap and potentially reach a price closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the value this product brings. However, to be candid,  $1,800,000 falls short of what I had in mind. Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle at $2,100,000? I believe this price reflects both the product's worth and our willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've lowered our price from $2,300,000 to $2,100,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This significant concession may encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We're still above Bob's initial offer,  indicating the $2M+ range is where we aim to be.
* **Positive Language:**  Phrases like ""find a middle ground,"" ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" and ""willingness"" encourage a collaborative negotiation rather than a confrontational one. 
* **Time Awareness:**  With rounds left, we're not rushing the process. Steady decreases in our asking price show progress while keeping our goal in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,950,000. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is moving in the right direction, the increment from his last offer is relatively small.  We want to encourage larger jumps.
* **Above Reserve, but Room to Grow:** $1,950,000 is a good price, but with 6 rounds remaining, we're confident we can push for more, especially since we have John's offer as a fallback.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  Consistent rejection shows Bob we're serious about achieving a higher price and encourages him to be more aggressive in his next offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position on the price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, to make this work on my end, I'd need to see a price closer to $2,050,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects the true value of what's being offered.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We decrease our offer by $50,000, showing movement but at a slower pace. This signals that we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  We reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob why a higher price is justified. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning ""significant compromise"" and asking ""What do you say?"", we subtly increase the pressure and invite a more decisive response from Bob. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer keeps us above the $2M mark, aiming for a final price in the $2M-$2.05M range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $2,050,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, which is the highest I can go. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,900,000 is a very good offer. It's significantly above Bob's initial offer and within a range we are happy with. 
* **Time Considerations:**  While we have rounds left, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now eliminates the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling the negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. The potential increase in price might not outweigh the benefits of securing a deal now and moving on. 

**Overall:**  Bob's offer is strong, and accepting now guarantees a significant profit while avoiding potential risks associated with continued negotiation."
