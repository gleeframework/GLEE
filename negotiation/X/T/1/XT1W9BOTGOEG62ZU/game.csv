"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the value this product brings. However, to be candid,  $1,800,000 falls short of what I had in mind. Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle at $2,100,000? I believe this price reflects both the product's worth and our willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,950,000. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position on the price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, to make this work on my end, I'd need to see a price closer to $2,050,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects the true value of what's being offered.  What do you say?",2050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $2,050,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, which is the highest I can go. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1900000.0,Bob,6,
