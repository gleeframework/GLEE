"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I can do $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen!

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his target, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He can counter with a price closer to his ideal of $10,500 or even $10,750, aiming for a compromise."
