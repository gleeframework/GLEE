{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $10,000. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** It leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob counters, you can still work towards a price that's good for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than what you want.  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  There's no rush to sell to John as Bob is still interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I can do $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to work within my budget.  How about $10,750?  That's a fair price that's closer to where I need to be.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above your minimum and close to the middle ground. Accepting his offer ensures you get a decent price and avoid further negotiations.  While you could try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of him walking away and you having to sell to John for less makes this a reasonable compromise."
