"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for something unique, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway or consider a slight discount?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12800 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12800 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
