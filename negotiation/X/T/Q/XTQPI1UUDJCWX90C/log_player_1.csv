Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This would give you a good return while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal on this offer.
