Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a significant amount to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation. It's also important to highlight the value to Bob to potentially incentivize him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell for that amount, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is lower than I'm currently willing to accept, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, his offer is still below my desired threshold. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me the minimum amount I'm comfortable with. It's faster and less risky than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
