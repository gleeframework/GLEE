Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and you can always come down a bit while still staying above your minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as fair, which can make Bob more receptive.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always propose a lower price, moving closer to your minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
