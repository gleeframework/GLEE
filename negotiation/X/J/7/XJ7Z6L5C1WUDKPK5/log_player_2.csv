"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While buying from John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, accepting Alice's offer for $1,000,000 saves Bob $200,000.  This is a better deal for Bob even though it is above the product's worth to Alice."
