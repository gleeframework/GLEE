"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That said, the price is a bit high for me at the moment.  I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more in line with my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a very fair offer, reflecting the inherent worth of what's on the table."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds significant value. However, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. Would you consider $1,100,000?  I believe this represents a fair offer, bridging the gap between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly below my minimum. It's worth another counteroffer to see if I can get him closer to $1.5 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while hopefully working within your budget."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to stretch a bit further. How about $1,250,000? I feel that's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we're still $250,000 away from my minimum. I believe there's room for him to move closer to my target, so I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close!  I feel like $1,450,000 is a fair price that reflects the final stretch we've made in these negotiations.  What do you think?"",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  $1,300,000. I'm confident this price accurately represents the value of the product while staying within a reasonable range for me.  Let me know if we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer. While he's come up significantly, it's still $200,000 below my absolute minimum.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing John's offer isn't worth it.  Selling to John guarantees I receive my minimum acceptable price."
