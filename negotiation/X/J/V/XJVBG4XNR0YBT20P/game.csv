"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That said, the price is a bit high for me at the moment.  I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more in line with my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a very fair offer, reflecting the inherent worth of what's on the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
