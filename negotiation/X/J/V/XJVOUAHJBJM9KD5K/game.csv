"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. ",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum expectation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the potential value for both of us. This offer is close to my limit, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,280,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm not willing to give up much more. My revised offer is $1,290,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
