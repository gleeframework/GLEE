"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about we try $1250000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
