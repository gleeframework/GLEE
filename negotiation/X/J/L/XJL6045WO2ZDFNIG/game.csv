"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I understand the product's value to me, but I'm only able to offer $950000 at this time. I'm confident this price is fair given my budget and the value to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. This is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1100000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a premium support package, which will give you added value and peace of mind. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on this product. My final offer is $1100000 with the extras.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not able to reach $1100000.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This price is a good middle ground, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll sell the product to you for $1075000, and I'll throw in a 2-year extension on the warranty, so you'll get even more value out of the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
