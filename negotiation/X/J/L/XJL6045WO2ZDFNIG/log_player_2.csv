"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You can likely get a better deal by negotiating. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I understand the product's value to me, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time. I'm confident this price is fair given my budget and the value to you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's not worth risking losing a good deal by accepting her offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. This is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1100000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a premium support package, which will give you added value and peace of mind. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on this product. My final offer is $1100000 with the extras. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the extras are tempting,  Alice's offer is still above your desired price. You can likely still negotiate a better price or consider buying from John if you're unwilling to budge further.  The extra warranty and support might be nice, but they aren't worth paying an extra $100,000 for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not able to reach $1,100,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This price is a good middle ground, and I hope we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll sell the product to you for $1075000, and I'll throw in a 2-year extension on the warranty, so you'll get even more value out of the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and you're getting a decent deal with the additional warranty extension.  At this price, it's worth accepting rather than risking further negotiation or buying from John.  You are now getting a lower price and some extra benefits, which is a good outcome."
