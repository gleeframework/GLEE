I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a decent profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000. This is still a decent profit for me and shows flexibility to Bob, hopefully encouraging him to counter with a higher offer."

Bob's offer is getting too low for me to consider.  I'm better off selling to John and getting my minimum price of $1,200,000."
