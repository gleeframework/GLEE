Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) while ensuring a sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially increasing your profit.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John. This approach minimizes risk while aiming high."
