"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, he shouldn't accept an offer of $10,000. He has a better option with John.  However, he should see if he can negotiate a better price with Alice before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the $8,000 price point, but he knows he needs to offer something reasonable to Alice.  $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, and it's a starting point for negotiation.  This offer shows Bob is serious about buying the product while still trying to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible.  While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  He's willing to risk another round of negotiation, hoping to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, moving from $10,000 to $9,500. Bob increases his offer slightly to $9,000, which is still a significant discount for Alice. He hopes this will be a good compromise, but he is prepared to walk away if necessary."
