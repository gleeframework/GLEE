"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which would still give you a good profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my initial price to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident this price still provides you with a strong return on your investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Let's try $890,000.  This is a small step closer to your offer and allows us to find some middle ground.  I'm confident this is a price that provides you with a great value for this product.",890000.0,Alice,5,
