Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but she needs to make the offer attractive enough for Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Any offer above that has the potential to be profitable for him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice starts high, the message implies openness to discussion with the phrase ""What do you think?"" 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Deal with Bob:** The offered price is significantly lower than John's offer, making it enticing for Bob. 
2. **Maximize Alice's Profit:** If Bob accepts, Alice makes a profit of $150,000, which is better than her guaranteed profit with John."
