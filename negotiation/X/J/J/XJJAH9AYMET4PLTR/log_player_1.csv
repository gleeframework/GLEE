"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the fact that this price is still below what the product is worth to me. This creates a sense of urgency and makes the offer seem more appealing.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation. The 10 rounds give me enough time to explore different options, and the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I believe we can find a price closer to the value of the product to both parties. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:**  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I want to see if I can secure a higher price.
* **Potential for Counter-Offers:** By rejecting, I can initiate further negotiations and potentially increase the price. 
* **Time is on my Side:** With 10 rounds, I have time to explore options and see if Bob is willing to budge further.

**Strategy:**

This decision is a calculated risk. While I could accept $10,000 and guarantee a sale, I'm gambling on my ability to push for a higher price. The possibility of selling to John for $15,000 provides a fallback option if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the ""great deal"" aspect, highlighting the value Bob receives at this price.
* **Call to Action:** The message ends with a clear call to action, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and close the deal.

**Strategy:**

By offering $11,000, I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'll have more rounds to negotiate and potentially push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's aim for a price closer to the midpoint between our offers. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than my target price of $12,000.
* **Seeking a Higher Price:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially with several rounds left.
* **The Power of Counteroffers:** By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I can potentially nudge Bob closer to my desired price point.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to hold out for a better price, hoping that Bob will become more willing to compromise as the negotiations progress. The option to sell to John for $15,000 gives me a secure fallback if the deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by coming down slightly from my previous offer, but still staying above Bob's last proposal. 
* **Midpoint Appeal:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""fair compromise"" and a step closer to a deal.
* **Clear Call to Action:** The message ends with a direct question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a price that's both acceptable to me and enticing enough for Bob to accept.  By continuing to counter-offer, I hope to nudge the price closer to my desired range. The fallback option of selling to John keeps me in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I think we're getting closer. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 below my initial target of $12,000. 
* **Time Factor:**  We're already in round 6, and continuing to negotiate could risk the deal falling apart, especially with the option to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and guarantees a substantial profit.

**Strategy:**

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of further negotiations failing is growing. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale at a price that's still significantly above my minimum, minimizing the risk and maximizing my earnings."
