"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That price is a bit high for me, but I do see the value in the product. How about we bring it down closer to  $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While that price is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could we meet at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this.  $1,150,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I can go as low as $1,180,000, but that's my final offer.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,165,000. That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a very competitive offer considering your 'final offer'.",1165000.0,Bob,6,
