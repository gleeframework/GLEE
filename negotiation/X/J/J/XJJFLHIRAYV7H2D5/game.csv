"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800000 is a bit too low for me. Given the product's potential value, I'm willing to pay $1200000. This represents a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to let go of the product for $1200000. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the potential value of the product, I'm willing to pay $1000000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value to both of us. I believe this offer represents a solid deal, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.
