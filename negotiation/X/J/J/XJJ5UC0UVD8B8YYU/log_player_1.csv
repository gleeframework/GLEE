"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110.  This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also likely Bob will see this as a fair price, as it's only $30 more than the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and gives Bob some room to negotiate. It's also a reasonable jump from his last offer, showing him that I'm willing to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my target price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I have a few more rounds left to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is another compromise, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price. It's also a reasonable jump from his last offer, showing him that I'm willing to meet halfway.  We are getting closer to a deal, and I believe we can close this soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and we are now in round 6.  I'm concerned that we are going to run out of rounds before reaching a price I'm comfortable with.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'm going to sell the product to him."
