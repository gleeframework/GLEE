"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's budget, but it's still better than buying from John. Bob should counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit of $800,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident I can get the product at a price that works for both of us, and I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering it to you for $885,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's very close to his budget of $800,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will walk away and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to ensure Bob gets the product within his budget."
