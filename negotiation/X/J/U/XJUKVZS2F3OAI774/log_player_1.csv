"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a low price right away. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $140. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, trying to push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I understand you're still not quite at my ideal price, but $140 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $145?  I'm really hoping to close this deal with you."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $135 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is likely to get us nowhere. He's still below my minimum acceptable price, and the rounds are getting limited. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
