"Hi Alice,  $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $7000. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, I can't go as low as $7000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell for $8500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8500 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
