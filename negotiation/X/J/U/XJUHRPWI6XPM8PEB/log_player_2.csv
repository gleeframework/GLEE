"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price before accepting or resorting to John.  Rejecting allows you to explore negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $7,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** A significant counteroffer (30% off) shows you're serious about negotiating while leaving room for compromise.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""a bit steep"") makes the counteroffer less arbitrary. 
* **Showing Interest:**  ""Really interested"" keeps the conversation positive and prevents Alice from thinking you're disengaged."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, I can't go as low as $7000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell for $8500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to keep negotiating. There's room for a lower counteroffer that might be more appealing to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway.
* **Positive Framing:** ""Fair price for both of us"" positions the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Maintain Interest:**  Continuing the conversation keeps the negotiation alive."
