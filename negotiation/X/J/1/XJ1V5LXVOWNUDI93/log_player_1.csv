Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The Message:**  It's friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects my offer. This gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also lower than my initial offer of $14,000. Accepting his offer would mean selling the product for less than what it's worth to me. 

**Strategy:**

* I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. 
* I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* If Bob continues to offer a price that is too low, I will sell the product to John for $15,000, as this is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still represents a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This price is a compromise, offering a significant discount from my initial offer but still remaining above Bob's proposed price. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging his counteroffer, reiterating the value proposition for him, and emphasizing my willingness to compromise. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us.
* I'm still leaving room for negotiation, but I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to go below a certain price. 
* My next move will depend on Bob's response. If he rejects again, I may have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also only $200 lower than my last counteroffer of $13,000.  Given that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, it's a good idea to accept Bob's offer, as it's a reasonable price and avoids any further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* It's important to recognize that negotiating can be time-consuming and doesn't always lead to a better outcome.
* Accepting Bob's offer allows me to make a quick sale and secure a decent profit.
* I can always use the experience from this negotiation to improve my negotiation skills for future transactions."
