"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $10000 is a good one, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12000. How about we try $12250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",12250.0,Alice,5,
