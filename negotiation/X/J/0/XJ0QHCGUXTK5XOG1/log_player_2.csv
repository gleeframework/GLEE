{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating. 
* I'm aiming for a price that's still attractive to me but might be a bit aggressive for Alice.
*  I want to see how Alice responds to this counteroffer. If she accepts, great! If not, we can continue negotiating."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice keeps raising her offer, which means she is likely firm on her desired price.
*  I'm still hoping to get a lower price, but I need to be more strategic.  
*  I'll try a counteroffer closer to Alice's latest offer, but still within my budget. 
* If she rejects it again, I'll need to seriously consider buying from John to avoid running out of rounds."

* This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last one, showing a willingness to meet her halfway.
* If this is rejected, I'll likely need to buy from John in the next round to avoid losing the chance altogether."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now higher than my initial acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  
* I've already made a significant counteroffer, but Alice is not budging. 
* To avoid missing the opportunity altogether, it's better to buy from John at this point, as I'll still be able to save some money compared to buying from John initially."
