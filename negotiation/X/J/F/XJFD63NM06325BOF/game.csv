"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and its potential benefit to your business. Let me know your thoughts!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $12000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13500? This price reflects the product's value and gives you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $13000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
