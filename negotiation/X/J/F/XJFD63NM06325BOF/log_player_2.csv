"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and its potential benefit to your business. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  You have no information about the product's actual value, and you can always buy from John for the same price. Rejecting gives you an opportunity to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  By offering significantly lower than Alice's initial price, you show that you're serious about negotiating and encourage her to come down.
* **Reasonable counter:** $12,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further negotiation while still respecting your budget. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a polite and interested tone, keeping the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $12000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13500? This price reflects the product's value and gives you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $13,500 is still above your target price.  Rejecting her offer gives you a chance to counter with a price closer to your desired $12,000, potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $13,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:**  Instead of jumping back to your initial $12,000, you're moving closer to Alice's offer in a way that shows you're serious about negotiation.
* **Justifying your offer:** You're reinforcing the value of the product while emphasizing your budget constraints.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, maintaining a good rapport with Alice."
