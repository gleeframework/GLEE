"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $107.50. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $106.25?",106.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I can offer it to you for $106.00. It's a bit of a stretch, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",106.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. I can go up to $105.50, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us.",105.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105.50 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I can offer it to you for $105.25. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",105.25,Alice,7,
