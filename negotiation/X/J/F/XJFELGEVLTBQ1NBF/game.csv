"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for such a high-quality product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $14000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",13500.0,Bob,6,
