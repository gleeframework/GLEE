"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

I appreciate the compromise Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That seems fair to me.,90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $98 is closer, but to seal the deal, I'd be willing to do $93. What do you say?",93.0,Bob,6,
