"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm only able to go up to $950,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit while also acknowledging the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) and is within Bob's budget.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject his counteroffer, potentially forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price slightly higher than his ideal but still a good deal."
