"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm only able to go up to $950000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit while also acknowledging the value the product holds for you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
