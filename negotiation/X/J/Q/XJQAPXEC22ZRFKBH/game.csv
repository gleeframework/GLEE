"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm confident that's a fair price given the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. While $1,800,000 is a respectable offer, I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,150,000. This price reflects a more accurate valuation of the product's long-term benefits for your specific needs.",2150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $2,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but your current offer doesn't reflect the true value and potential this product holds for your business. I'm willing to stand firm at $2,050,000. Let's not miss this opportunity over a difference that, in the long run, is insignificant compared to the value this product will bring you.",2050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer at $1,700,000, so I'm now offering $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
