Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to lower her price, it's still above Bob's budget. With only a few rounds remaining, it's not guaranteed that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $800,000, as it is within his budget and saves him a significant amount of money compared to Alice's final offer."
