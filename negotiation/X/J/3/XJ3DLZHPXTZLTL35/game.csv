"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $125, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $122? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to make a concession to move the sale forward.",122.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $122 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I'm really interested in buying it, and I think that's a fair price. Can you consider it?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you a deal at $122 and you've rejected it. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're not willing to meet me at $122, I think we're at an impasse. I'll consider selling the product to John for $120 if you're not willing to meet my price.",122.0,Alice,7,
