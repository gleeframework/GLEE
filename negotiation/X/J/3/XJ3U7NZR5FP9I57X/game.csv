"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I'm still unable to meet the price point of $1,300,000. I would like to propose $1,250,000 as a compromise. I hope this is within your consideration.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're close to a deal that benefits us both.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $1,275,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
