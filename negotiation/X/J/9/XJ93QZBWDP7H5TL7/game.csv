"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,250. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,750?  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you place on it. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us if we keep talking.  How about $11,000? It's a fair price that allows us to both come to an agreement. ",11000.0,Bob,6,
