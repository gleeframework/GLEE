"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. Let's discuss the details.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me in the middle at $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm counteroffering at $850000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $750000. Can we discuss further?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is my best and final concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a concession, Alice, but I still think $825000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $775000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still discussing the details. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's worth. I'm counteroffering at $810000. This is my last concession, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",810000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $810000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I'm thinking $785000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",785000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not convinced that $785000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $820000. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",820000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go above $785000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm making one final offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",785000.0,Bob,10,
