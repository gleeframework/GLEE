"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $760,000? This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while staying within a reasonable price range.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $825,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
