"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 maximum and what John offers. You can save a considerable amount by rejecting this offer and going with John."
