{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything significantly less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your value for the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum of $15,000 and allows me to earn a bit more.  Accepting his offer is the best choice."
