"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. This product, tailored specifically to meet your needs and expectations, is worth $1,500,000 to you. I am offering it to you at a special price of $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair and advantageous deal considering its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you. I am confident that this investment will not only meet but exceed your expectations. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is overvaluing the product to you:** She claims it's worth $1,500,000 to you, but you know your own valuation is lower. 
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product at your maximum price ($1,500,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her or go with John's offer. 

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, there's room for saving money by either getting her to come down or going with John."
