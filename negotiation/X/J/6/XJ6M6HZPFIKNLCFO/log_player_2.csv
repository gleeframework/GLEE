Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $115? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this great product.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is unlikely to budge below $115, and you've already reached your maximum budget. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which meets your needs."
