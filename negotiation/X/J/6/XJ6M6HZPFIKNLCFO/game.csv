,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider something closer to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $120 is closer to what I'd be willing to spend, it's still a little high for me.  Would you consider $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle again at $110? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $100 even? That's the absolute maximum I can offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $115? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this great product.",115.0,Alice,7,
