,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I can work with that price. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115, which is a fair compromise given our current positions.  I hope you'll consider this final offer. Let me know your decision.",115.0,Alice,5,
