Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly greeting, sets a price point that is a good starting point for negotiation ($140 is a reasonable compromise between your $120 minimum and Bob's $150 value), and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While $130 is less than your ideal price, it's still above your minimum of $120 and closer to Bob's perceived value. Accepting his offer secures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
