Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Offering it at or above $15,000 is pointless since Bob only values it at $12,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. You can always come down a bit and still make a good profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:**  The fact that John will buy it for $15,000 provides a strong safety net. This means you shouldn't accept anything less than $15,000 from Bob unless you're convinced he'll walk away."
