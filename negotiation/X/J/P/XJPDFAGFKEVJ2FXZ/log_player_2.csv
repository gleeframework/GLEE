Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really serious about getting the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, which is $10,750. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?

At this point, Alice is showing a willingness to compromise and the price difference is getting smaller. Accepting at $10,750 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price and further haggling might irritate Alice."
