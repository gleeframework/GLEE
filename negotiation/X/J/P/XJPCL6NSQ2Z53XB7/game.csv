"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $155? ",155.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $165 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about I offer it to you for $160? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",160.0,Alice,5,
