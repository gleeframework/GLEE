Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're running out of room for negotiation. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us. This is my final offer at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000.
