"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $132.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",130.0,Bob,4,
