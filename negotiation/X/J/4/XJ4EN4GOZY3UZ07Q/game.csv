"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great price considering the value it will bring to your business.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, $7,500 is a great starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,250. This is a great compromise that still provides value to both of us.",7250.0,Alice,3,
