"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $90, which is higher than my minimum value but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Strategy:** This opening offer establishes my starting point and sets the stage for negotiation. I'm prepared to lower my price if necessary, but I want to see how Bob responds first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $70 is tempting, it falls below my minimum value of $80.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. 

I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $70 is a good offer, I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with $85. This is a compromise that's halfway between my minimum value and Bob's initial offer.  
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my willingness to negotiate. I'm framing the $85 price as a ""meeting halfway"" point to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my flexibility while still staying above my minimum desired price.  I'm aiming for a quick resolution to avoid losing time and the risk of having to sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $75 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I believe there's still room to find a price that's mutually agreeable.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective.  Let's split the difference one more time.  How about $80?  That's my absolute minimum, and it's a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with $80, which is my minimum value. I'm emphasizing that this is my absolute minimum to convey my seriousness and show that I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and reiterating my willingness to find a middle ground.  I'm framing the $80 price as a ""fair deal"" for both of us.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a final attempt to secure a price that meets my minimum value.  If Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John for $80. However, I'm hopeful that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept my offer."
