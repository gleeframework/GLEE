"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. $18000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10000 right now.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. It's a good middle ground between our initial offers. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $12000. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there with $13500. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another small concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13200. It's a tiny increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,7,
