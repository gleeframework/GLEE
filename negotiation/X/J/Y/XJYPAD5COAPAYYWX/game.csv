"Bob, I'm excited about the potential for this product in your hands. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both a great deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. It's a valuable product, and I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to keep the negotiation moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
