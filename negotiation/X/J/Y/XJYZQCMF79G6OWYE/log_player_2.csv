Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1,000,000. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to consider my costs and profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to the value the product holds for you as possible. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering $1,300,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm at my bottom line. I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer of $1,225,000. I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I won't be able to go lower than $1,250,000.
