"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1,000,000. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to consider my costs and profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to the value the product holds for you as possible. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, this is a fair deal you're offering, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we split the difference one last time?  If you're willing to do $1,225,000, I'll accept right now.",1225000.0,Bob,6,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering $1,300,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm at my bottom line. I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer of $1,225,000. I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I won't be able to go lower than $1,250,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,7,,
