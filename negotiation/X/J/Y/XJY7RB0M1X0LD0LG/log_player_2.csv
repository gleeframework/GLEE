"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $120 is too high for Bob, as he values the product at $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down as much as possible while still being within his budget.  $100 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the product's value.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal considering he values the product at $150. Accepting the offer saves Bob $40 compared to buying from John and allows him to close the deal.  There's no guarantee that Bob will get a better price in the future rounds, so it's a good decision to accept."
