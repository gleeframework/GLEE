"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a high price ($1,800,000) gives me room to negotiate downwards. It also sets a strong initial expectation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great opportunity"" to emphasize the value Bob would be getting, even though it's higher than his perceived worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

**Important Note:**  I'm aware this is a high initial offer. I'm willing to take the risk of Bob rejecting it, as I have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000.  My goal is to maximize my earnings, and I'm prepared to use these 10 rounds strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. This is still a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $1,400,000 is a significant improvement from his initial perceived value of $800,000, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer in the next round. This keeps the negotiation active and gives me the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 at any point. This provides a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll carefully consider a counteroffer that bridges the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'll aim to find a price that is both acceptable to me and enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings and offers you a solid investment opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridge the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,600,000 is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product and framing the offer as an investment opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, signaling my willingness to continue the negotiation and find a mutually agreeable solution.

**Strategy:**

By using a counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. I'm confident that this price is still attractive to Bob, considering his initial offer of $1,400,000, and it gives me a good chance of securing a deal that meets my minimum requirements. I'm also keeping in mind that John is always a viable option, which provides a safety net in case the negotiation doesn't lead to a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,400,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. This means I'm guaranteed to make at least my target profit.
* **Final Offer:**  Bob has stated that this is his final offer.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk of rejecting Bob's offer and entering another round of negotiations. However, the potential reward is minimal, as I'm already at my minimum price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this point. It ensures I achieve my minimum financial goal and avoids further risk of a failed negotiation. While I would have preferred a higher price, this outcome is still successful."
