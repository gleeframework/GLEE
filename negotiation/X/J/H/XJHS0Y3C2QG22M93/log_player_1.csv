Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price of $12,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still being attractive to Bob (he saves $3,000 from his maximum valuation). 

This approach aims for a win-win scenario. You secure a substantial profit above your minimum, and Bob gets the product at a price well below his perceived value."
