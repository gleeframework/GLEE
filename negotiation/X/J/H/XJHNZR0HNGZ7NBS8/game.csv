"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1000000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
