"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $650,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. Would you be open to $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant gap from my initial asking price.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience through all this.  I understand that you value the product highly, and I want to be sure we can reach an agreement.  Would you consider $775,000? I think that's a very strong offer, and it demonstrates how serious I am about purchasing this from you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
