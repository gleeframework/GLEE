Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $650,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. Would you be open to $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is steadily increasing his offers. We're still significantly below my minimum, but I want to see how much further he'll move towards my target before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant gap from my initial asking price.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 850000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your patience through all this.  I understand that you value the product highly, and I want to be sure we can reach an agreement.  Would you consider $775,000? I think that's a very strong offer, and it demonstrates how serious I am about purchasing this from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but his pace is slow.  At this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $800,000 within the remaining rounds. John's offer is a guaranteed $800,000, and it makes more sense to take the sure profit now rather than risk Bob not meeting my price."
