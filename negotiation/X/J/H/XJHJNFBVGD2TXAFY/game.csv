"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $1,500,000. This price reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
