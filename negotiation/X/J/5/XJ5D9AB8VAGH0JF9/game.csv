,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
