Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000 is a good starting point.** It's a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,000,000, making it appealing to Bob, while still leaving me with a decent profit.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It highlights the mutual benefit of the deal and keeps the conversation open. 
* **This strategy allows for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly.

**Remember, I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if I feel Bob isn't serious or if the negotiation drags on too long.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000 and even below his own perceived value of $800,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation.** I can counter with a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Selling to John is still an option.**  While $1,000,000 is appealing, I'm not yet desperate enough to give up on negotiating with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I'll need to send Bob a counteroffer.  It needs to be higher than $750,000 but lower than $900,000 to keep the negotiation moving. I'll also need to adjust my message to be firm but still open to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at more than $750,000, I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum value:** $850,000 is a compromise, but still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Message is firm but still open to compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's budget, but also reiterate the value of the product. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can consider lowering the price further, but only slightly. 

**Remember, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory outcome.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value.**  $825,000 is only $75,000 below my desired $900,000. 
* **The negotiation is likely to continue.**  If I reject, Bob may be unwilling to offer any more, and I could potentially lose the deal with him altogether.
* **The risk of selling to John is minimal.** Although I can sell to John for $1,000,000, the extra $175,000 from that sale isn't worth risking losing the deal with Bob entirely.

**By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale with a reasonable profit, and I minimize the risk of ending up with no sale at all.**"
