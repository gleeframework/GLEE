"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm going for a high price, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept. However, I'm ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response.  

Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $8000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I will counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $9,000.  This reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still aiming to keep the cost at $8000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is persistent in his $8,000 price point. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also mindful of the time and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. It's better to secure the $8,000 now than risk further rounds of negotiations that might lead to a lower price or even a breakdown in the deal."
