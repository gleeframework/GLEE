{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer rather than just rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I get a price closer to my minimum of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering $9,500. This is a compromise that still allows me to get closer to my minimum of $12,000, while also showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum, it's getting closer and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will just take more time and potentially lead to a lower price. I'm also concerned that John might not be interested in the product for much longer, so it's important to close a deal soon."
