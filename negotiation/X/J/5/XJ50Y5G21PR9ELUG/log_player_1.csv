Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping he'll negotiate down.  This is a classic bargaining strategy to leave room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can get at least $100 from John.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about $105?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price of $100. This shows flexibility while keeping the negotiation in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price. John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum, so it's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
