"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $750,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions.",825000.0,Bob,4,
