"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is higher than her product valuation ($1,300,000 vs. $1,200,000). There's room for negotiation. While I could buy from John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still comfortably above her valuation.  This leaves room for negotiation and tests her willingness to move.
* **Polite and Positive:** I want to keep the negotiation amicable and collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now met her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000)."
