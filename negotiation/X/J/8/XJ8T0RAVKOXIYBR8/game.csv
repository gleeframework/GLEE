"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? It's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm happy to see we're making progress. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within your budget. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11500. I'm willing to pay $11250. This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,6,
