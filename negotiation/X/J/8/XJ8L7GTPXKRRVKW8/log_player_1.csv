Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob will see value in negotiating, as he can potentially get it for less than $15,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for some back-and-forth to see if you can reach a price that's mutually beneficial.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
