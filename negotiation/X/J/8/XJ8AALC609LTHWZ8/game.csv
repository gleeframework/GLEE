"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach an agreement, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $912,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $912,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $890,000 for the product.  This price is close to your last offer, and it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal!",890000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,7,
