"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit high for me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for closer to my initial price. How about $13,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it leaves room for us to both be happy with the transaction.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 just isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still need to be careful with my budget. How about $12,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay under $12,500.",12200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $12,750.  This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product and my initial asking price.  If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. ",12750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above $12,750. How about $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stick to my budget.",12500.0,Bob,8,
