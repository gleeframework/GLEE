Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit high for me.

You have three options:

I want to try to get a better price than $12,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above $12,750. How about $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stick to my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've gone through several rounds and it seems like Bob is unwilling to go higher than $12,500. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John for $10,000 is still a decent outcome, and it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
