,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $75 is just a little too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $85, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $78 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about $82? That's a fair price for both of us.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $82 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $79 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",79.0,Bob,6,
