I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product to me. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $15,000, so there's no risk involved in offering a higher price."
