Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price ending in ""999"" might make Bob perceive it as a slightly better deal psychologically.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We know the product's worth to Bob ($8,000), but not his negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above that. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Alice has more information (John's guaranteed offer) than Bob.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
