"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. Given its quality and exclusivity, I believe it's worth more than $100. Would you be interested in discussing a fair price? Let's aim for something around $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I propose we set the price at $95. This offers a reasonable compromise between the value of the product and your budget. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. Given my budget, I can offer $85 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both your value and my limitations.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the quality of the product and your budget, I am willing to agree on a price of $90. I believe this price strikes a good balance between the value of the product and your financial situation. I hope this proposal works for you.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I value your effort, $90 is still slightly above my budget. I'm confident I can offer a final price of $87, which would be the best possible compromise. It's within my budget and I believe it's a good price for the product. Let's close this deal.",87.0,Bob,6,
