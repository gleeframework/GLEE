"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation. It also tests Bob's level of interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$1,200,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm going to try to squeeze out a bit more by rejecting this offer and seeing if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,550,000. This is a strong position because it's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows Bob I'm serious about closing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will continue to offer lower prices or we'll run out of rounds.  It's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees I meet my minimum price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
