"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make sure you see the value of this product.  $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet closer to the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
