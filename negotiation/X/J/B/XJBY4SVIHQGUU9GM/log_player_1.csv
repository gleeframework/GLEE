Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to offer $9000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,000. This is close to my minimum acceptable price and it's better than selling to John for $10,000.  It's also possible that if I reject this offer, Bob might not make another counteroffer or walk away from the deal entirely."
