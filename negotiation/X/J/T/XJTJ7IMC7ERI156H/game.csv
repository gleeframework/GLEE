"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While I can't accept your offer of $1000000, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1100000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1000000.  Would you be open to meeting halfway at $1050000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
