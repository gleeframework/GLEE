"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'd accept ($1,500,000) but still within a range that might be attractive to Bob. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by expressing confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is unfortunately not enough.  The product's value is undeniable, and I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to go with John's deal if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  While it's tempting to accept as I'm running out of rounds, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and while I'm willing to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is John's price.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to finalize the deal with John if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price.  While I'd like to earn more, it's important to close the deal. I'm running out of rounds, and John is a reliable alternative. It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk losing both Bob and John."
