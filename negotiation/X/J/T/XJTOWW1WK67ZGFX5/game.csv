"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is unfortunately not enough.  The product's value is undeniable, and I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to go with John's deal if we can't reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and while I'm willing to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.  Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is John's price.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to finalize the deal with John if we can't reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
