{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds for you. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high. While it's closer to my target, I want to see if I can get it even lower.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a slightly higher price.  I'll also continue to consider buying from John if we can't come to an agreement."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, my absolute minimum.  This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this now.
