Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand he's trying to negotiate, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. I believe this price is fair considering the potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's coming closer to my desired price, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable amount. I believe I can push for a better price in the next round."
