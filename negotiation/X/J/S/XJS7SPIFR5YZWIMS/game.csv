"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'll meet you halfway again, and offer you the product for $9,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,5,
