"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the return on investment you'll experience.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,100,000 falls quite short of what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $1,200,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one final adjustment to seal the deal. How about we settle at $1,225,000? This allows me to recognize your limit while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
