Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price of $8,000.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a strong offer of $12,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price without explicitly revealing his maximum valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John provides a safety net. This allows us to confidently aim higher with Bob."
