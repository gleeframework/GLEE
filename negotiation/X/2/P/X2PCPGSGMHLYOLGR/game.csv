,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your original price. However,  I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference at $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both agree on.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
