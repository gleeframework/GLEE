You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference at $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both agree on.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than John's offer, it's still a bit higher than Bob wants to pay.  Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
