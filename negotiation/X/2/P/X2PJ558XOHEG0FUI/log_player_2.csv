Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's counteroffer of $125 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but he's willing to try to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again offering a price halfway between his previous offer of $105 and Alice's current offer of $125. He's demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price he's comfortable with. This approach shows a consistent pattern of negotiation that could lead to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still within Bob's budget, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price. Since Bob is trying to save money but also wants the product, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
