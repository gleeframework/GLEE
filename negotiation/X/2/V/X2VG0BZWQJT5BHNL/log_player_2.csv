"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than John's offer, there's still room to negotiate.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum budget as possible.  Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer while still leaving some room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is only $1,500 over Bob's maximum budget.  It's a good deal for Bob considering the potential hassle and time involved in further negotiation. At this point, it's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
