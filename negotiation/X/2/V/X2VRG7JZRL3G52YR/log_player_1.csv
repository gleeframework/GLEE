Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so starting near that value is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, leave some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down. This makes him feel more in control and could still land you a price higher than your backup offer. 
* **Justify the Price (Subtly):**  Mentioning ""fair price"" and ""significant value"" subtly reinforces the idea that the price is reasonable without explicitly revealing your bottom line.
* **Don't Be Greedy:** Asking for the full $15,000 Bob values the product at might make him walk away.  There's a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
