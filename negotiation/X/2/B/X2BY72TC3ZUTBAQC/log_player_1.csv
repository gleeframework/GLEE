Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $100 but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $120 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
