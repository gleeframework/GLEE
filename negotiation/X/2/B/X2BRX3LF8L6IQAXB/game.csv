"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the maximum I'm willing to pay, I'd like to offer you $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your position, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would allow us to reach a compromise and make this deal work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also being closer to your desired price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
