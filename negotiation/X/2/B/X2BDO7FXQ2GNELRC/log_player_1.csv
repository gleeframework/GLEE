"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount for Bob:** He values the product at $10,000, so he's getting a good deal.
* **It's still above my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000, so this price leaves room for negotiation. 

This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation that could lead to a price closer to my ideal selling point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can continue to negotiate and try to secure a price closer to my desired $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my counteroffer to $9,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his initial valuation of $10,000. However, it's also closer to my desired price point and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. This approach balances the need to get a good price with the potential risk of losing the deal if I'm too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,700 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $9,000.  I've shown flexibility by lowering my offer in the previous round.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a price that's more favorable for me.  I'm also aware that selling to John for $8,000 is always an option if this negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $8,900. This is a small compromise that shows I'm serious about making a deal, but it's still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to close the deal. We're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation, and I need to balance the need to close the deal with the desire to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,800.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  With only 4 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation could result in Bob walking away or me having to sell to John at a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit while securing the sale."
