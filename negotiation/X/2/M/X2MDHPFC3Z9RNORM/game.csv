"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth to both of us. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still thinking that $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
