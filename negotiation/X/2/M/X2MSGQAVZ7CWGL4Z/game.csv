"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a little too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point is still extremely competitive considering the unique benefits and potential returns this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I'm targeting something closer to $700,000.  Would that be a possibility?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand your perspective, but the product's intrinsic value and market potential warrant a higher price.  Let's settle at $1,650,000.  This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's worth.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price is still beyond my budget. To be completely transparent, I have a firm ceiling of $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
