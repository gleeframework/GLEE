Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price is still beyond my budget. To be completely transparent, I have a firm ceiling of $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his absolute maximum price is $800,000.  It's highly unlikely he'll budge beyond this point. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss compared to John's standing offer of $1,500,000. Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to bridge this gap. Therefore, the most profitable decision is to sell to John."
