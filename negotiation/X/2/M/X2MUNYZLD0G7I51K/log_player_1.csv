"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit. This should encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and hopefully lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my target price. I believe I can get closer to $100 by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try again? I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is closer to my desired price, I still believe there is room for improvement.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $92 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $94? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 94} 
```

I'm making another compromise, offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer while still leaving some room for potential profit. I hope this will convince Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. How about we try $91? I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer of $91 guarantees a sale and a decent profit.  It's also a good compromise and shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway, potentially leading to future business opportunities."
