"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To find a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
