Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus you could try to capture.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he declines, you go with your guaranteed sale.

**Strategy**

You need to strike a balance between:

* **Greed:** Aiming too high (close to $1,500,000) might make Bob walk away.
* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Aiming too low (close to $1,200,000) means missing out on potential profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,380,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1380000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Target Price:** $1,380,000 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's valuation, giving both parties a significant gain.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to justify the price without directly mentioning Bob's potential profit.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable, a slightly more generous offer might be strategic.

**Remember:** Negotiation is an art. This offer is a starting point. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
