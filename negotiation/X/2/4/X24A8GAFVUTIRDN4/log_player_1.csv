Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* This gives Bob room to negotiate while also leaving me a decent profit margin. 
* It's important to be friendly and positive in the message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a more favorable price. I can make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially getting closer to my desired price.  Selling to John right now would be the most profitable option, but I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Message:** I'm remaining positive and emphasizing that this is still a good deal for Bob. I also use language like ""Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us"" to keep the negotiation open and friendly.
* **Goal:** My goal is to reach a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than $11000. How about $9800? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his final offer of $9,800 is still far too low for me. I'm not willing to take such a significant loss on this product.  

At this point, I'm confident that John will buy the product from me for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees me a much better outcome compared to accepting Bob's offer."
