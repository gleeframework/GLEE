Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to give up on this negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
