"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a significant discount on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low. How about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is quite tight. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
