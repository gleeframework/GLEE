Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000:** This demonstrates your desire to sell to Bob, while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob:** This provides incentive for Bob to negotiate and potentially agree to a price closer to your target.

By offering this price, I'm positioning myself to potentially maximize my profit while still being open to negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is:

* **Significantly higher than John's offer:** This makes it more financially beneficial to sell to Bob.
* **Close to my minimum acceptable price:**  I'm comfortable accepting this price as it's close to my lower limit.

It's likely further negotiation won't result in a significantly higher price, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
