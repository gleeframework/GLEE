"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $8,200 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
