Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $7,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
