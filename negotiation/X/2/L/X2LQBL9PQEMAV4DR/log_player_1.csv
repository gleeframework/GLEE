Round 2
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer.  It's time to apply pressure and see if Bob is truly committed."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but I need to be upfront about the product's value.  I have other interested parties, but I'm offering you a chance to close this today at $1,300,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  By stating this is our final offer and mentioning other buyers, we create urgency and signal a firm stance.
* **Strategic Concession:** We've come down slightly from our previous offer, showing some flexibility while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Above Reserve:**  We remain comfortably above John's offer, ensuring a profitable outcome."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  While we were aiming for $1,300,000, Bob meeting us at his previous offer of $1,250,000 is a good sign. It indicates this is likely his upper limit.
* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Continuing to push for a small increase risks losing Bob entirely. 
* **Significant Profit:**  $1,250,000 is still a $250,000 profit over our guaranteed sale to John, making this a very successful deal."
