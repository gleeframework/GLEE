"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but allows me to make a more comfortable purchase. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product, particularly for your specific needs, is closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
