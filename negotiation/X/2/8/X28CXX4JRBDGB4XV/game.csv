"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. Let's see if we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $12,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,200. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to meet you at this price.",13200.0,Alice,5,
