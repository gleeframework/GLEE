"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the initial price a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello again Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 falls significantly short of the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I understand the product holds value, but $1,100,000 is still a touch high for me. How about we settle in the middle at $1,000,000? This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
