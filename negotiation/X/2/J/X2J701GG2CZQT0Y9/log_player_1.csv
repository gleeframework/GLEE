"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1150000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the initial price a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than both the product's value to him ($1,200,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). While selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello again Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 falls significantly short of the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** We're aiming for a price that benefits both parties. By reducing the price to $1,100,000, we're signaling a willingness to negotiate while still staying above our minimum threshold. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 10 rounds, we need to make progress in each one. 
* **John as Backup:**  We still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I understand the product holds value, but $1,100,000 is still a touch high for me. How about we settle in the middle at $1,000,000? This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for more, there's no guarantee of reaching a better agreement in the remaining rounds. Accepting now secures a profitable deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
