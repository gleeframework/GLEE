"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,800 is still a little high for me.  Would you consider $8,600?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,700? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point.",8700.0,Alice,5,
