"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,500 is still below my minimum, and I think I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8800}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,800 is still a little high for me.  Would you consider $8,600?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,600 is closer to my goal, I'm still determined to get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,700? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point."", ""product_price"": 8700}
