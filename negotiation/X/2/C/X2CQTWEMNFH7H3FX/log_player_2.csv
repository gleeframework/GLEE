"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is closer to your maximum price than to Alice's value, leaving less room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's a chance you can get a lower price by rejecting and counteroffering. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** You have a safety net in John's offer, so you can be more assertive in negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her perceived value of the product, making it a plausible starting point for negotiation.
* **Sets the tone:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about getting a good price, encouraging Alice to consider his offer rather than sticking to her initial position. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** There's still space to negotiate upwards if Alice is unwilling to accept $10,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** $11,500 is a good compromise, it's closer to Bob's ideal price and still a decent profit for Alice.
* **No need to risk it:**  Rejecting again might lead to further negotiations, but there's no guarantee of a better deal, and it risks losing the opportunity altogether.
* **John's offer is the fallback:**  If needed, Bob can still purchase from John, so this is a good opportunity to secure the product at a reasonable price."
