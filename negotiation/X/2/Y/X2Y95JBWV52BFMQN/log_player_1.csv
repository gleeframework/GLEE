Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?"", ""product_price"": 12250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $12,250. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I want to make a deal happen.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $11,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
