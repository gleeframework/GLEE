"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob.  Alice's offer is too high, so Bob should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 
 
Bob starts by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still potentially acceptable.  He is aiming to get a good deal, but also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's maximum, he still wants to try and get a better price. He has already rejected a higher offer and shown he's serious about negotiating. There are still rounds remaining, so it's worth continuing to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob is now offering his maximum price, making it clear that he is willing to close the deal but won't go any higher. This is a strong signal that he's serious about buying the product and hoping to get a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and Bob is within his budget. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will walk away, and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
