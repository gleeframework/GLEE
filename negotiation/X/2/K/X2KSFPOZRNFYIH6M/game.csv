"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my value for the product and the market rate, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my original offer was a fair one. Considering your willingness to pay $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a profit while also giving you a good deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
