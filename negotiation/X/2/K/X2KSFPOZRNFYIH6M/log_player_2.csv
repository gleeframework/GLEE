"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's significantly above your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a good deal for you compared to Alice's perspective, you can still do better. You should counter-offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my original offer was a fair one. Considering your willingness to pay $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a profit while also giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your target price of $800,000. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get a lower price. If you accept Alice's offer, you'll be paying more than you want. You can still get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still too high for Bob.  While she's made concessions, the price remains above Bob's ideal budget.  Given the option to purchase from John for $800,000, it's the most financially advantageous choice.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a price lower than John's offer."
