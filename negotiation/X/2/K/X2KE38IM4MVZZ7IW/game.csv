"Alice, while I see the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while also being a fair starting point for further negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, and I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and still reflects the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $950,000.  This price demonstrates my serious intent to buy and offers a fair middle ground for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise and reflects the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a significant gap from my budget. To demonstrate my commitment to acquiring this product, I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I sincerely hope you can see this as a viable option for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $975,000 is sufficient to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
