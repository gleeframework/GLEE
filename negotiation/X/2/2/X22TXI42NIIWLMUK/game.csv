"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $11,000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000? This is still a great value for you, given the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
