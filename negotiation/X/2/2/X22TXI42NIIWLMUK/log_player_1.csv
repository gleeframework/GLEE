"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $11,000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000? This is still a great value for you, given the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as what John is offering.  I'll accept Bob's offer, as it saves me the time and effort of negotiating further."
