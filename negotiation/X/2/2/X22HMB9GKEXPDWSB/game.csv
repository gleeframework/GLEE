"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,500. This is a fair price, as it's closer to your value and it's the maximum I can afford right now. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,750. This is a good compromise, as it's still a bit above your maximum budget, but it's closer to my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16750.0,Alice,5,
