"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to leverage the fact that the product is worth more to me than Bob. I want to see if I can get close to my minimum price in the first few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $130. This is closer to my minimum price of $120, and I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is just below my minimum price of $120, but it's still a decent deal considering I'm already four rounds into the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
