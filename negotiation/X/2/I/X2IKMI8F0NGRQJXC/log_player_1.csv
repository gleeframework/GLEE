Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired price, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind, potentially making him more receptive to a lower counteroffer that is still above your minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling that you're willing to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate and can walk away if the deal isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a substantial amount, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. You have the security of John's offer, so there's room to negotiate further and see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer comes down by $100,000 from your initial offer and is $200,000 above Bob's counter. This signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Highlighting Value:** Re-emphasizing the product's unique value and potential aims to justify the higher price point to Bob.
* **Seeking Compromise:** Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer maintains a price above your guaranteed sale to John, giving you some room to potentially negotiate further down if needed."
