Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This leaves room for negotiation without immediately shutting him down.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:**  You still have a margin for profit even if Bob accepts the first offer. 
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:**  You can adjust your position based on Bob's response. 

Let's see how Bob reacts to this initial offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I will reject this offer and try to get a higher price. I will counter with an offer closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's lower than my initial offer:**  Shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above Bob's offer:**  Maintains a profit margin for me.

This should put some pressure on Bob to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but not quite there. The risk of continuing the negotiation is that he might keep lowering his offer or become unwilling to negotiate further. I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
