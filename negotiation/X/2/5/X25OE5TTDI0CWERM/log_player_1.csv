Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique nature of the product,  $800000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $600000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price range between $700,000 and $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's unique value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay at this time. I'm willing to go up to $700000. If this is acceptable to you, we can close the deal. If not, I may have to consider other options.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $700,000. However, I'm still not convinced that this is a fair price for the product's value. I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. How about we meet at $725,000? It's a small step up from your offer, but I think it's still a reasonable compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 725000}"
