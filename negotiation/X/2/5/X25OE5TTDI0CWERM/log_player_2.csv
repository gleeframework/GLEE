"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. $800,000 is a significant amount, and there's potential for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique nature of the product,  $800,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It demonstrates a willingness to buy, but also sets a clear expectation for a lower price. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price range between $700000 and $800000. How about we meet in the middle at $750000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's unique value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not willing to accept it. $750,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I want to see if I can push her down further before considering accepting. Rejecting her offer will give me a chance to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay at this time. I'm willing to go up to $700,000. If this is acceptable to you, we can close the deal. If not, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues the negotiation while demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. It is a small increase from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about buying, but still keeping the price within my budget.  This will give Alice a chance to either accept the deal or make a final counteroffer before I have to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $700000. However, I'm still not convinced that this is a fair price for the product's value. I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. How about we meet at $725000? It's a small step up from your offer, but I think it's still a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is getting closer to my desired price range.  We're nearing the halfway point between my last counteroffer and her previous offer. Accepting at this point is a good compromise and gets me the product at a reasonable price.  It's also important to consider that I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and going to John would cost me significantly more."
