It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $12,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $10,000 is a significant discount from her initial price, but still leaves room for a compromise."

$11,000 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still hoping to get it for a little less. Let's see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $10,500.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price."

Alice has come down to my counteroffer, so it's a good deal for me. I'm happy to accept and save $4,500 compared to buying from John."
