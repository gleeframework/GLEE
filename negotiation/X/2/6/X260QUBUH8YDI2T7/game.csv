"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $800000 for me. While I see the value, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $800000.  I'm happy to start at $800000 and see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend $800000, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $837500.  This would still be a good deal for both of us.",837500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $837500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise.  While $850000 is getting closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. Let's meet halfway one more time and try $825000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,7,
