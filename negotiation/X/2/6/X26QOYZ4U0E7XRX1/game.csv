"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much as I can. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still give you a significant savings compared to the product's true value to you, and it would be a good deal for me as well. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go down to $10,750. This is a small compromise on my end, but it's a significant amount for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement here. ",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I need to be honest, that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'd be happy to make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
