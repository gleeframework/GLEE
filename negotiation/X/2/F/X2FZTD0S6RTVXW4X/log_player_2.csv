"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at the same price, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense.  You're not losing anything by rejecting and you might be able to get a better price from Alice or another seller later."
