""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,300,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes your profit.
* **Competition (John):**  Mentioning another interested party adds a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to accept a higher price.

Offering the product at $1,300,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still securing a substantial profit for you."
