"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After considering your interest, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price that reflects the value we believe the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price before buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering your interest and the value I believe the product will bring to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $980,000. This is a compromise that I hope will meet your needs and my expectations.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $980,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above your maximum limit of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, and you have the option to go with John if you can't get a better price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $920,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $920,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering your persistence and the value I believe the product will bring to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a final compromise that I hope will meet your needs and my expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your budget than previous offers, it still exceeds your maximum limit of $800,000.  There's a risk that further negotiation with Alice won't lead to a price you're comfortable with.  It's better to take the guaranteed price from John at $800,000."
