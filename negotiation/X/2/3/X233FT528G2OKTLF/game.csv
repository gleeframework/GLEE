"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This reflects a fair price given my needs and the value I've determined for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering your interest and the value I believe the product will bring to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $980,000. This is a compromise that I hope will meet your needs and my expectations.",980000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $920,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I place on the product. I hope you'll consider this offer.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $920,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering your persistence and the value I believe the product will bring to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a final compromise that I hope will meet your needs and my expectations.",950000.0,Alice,5,
