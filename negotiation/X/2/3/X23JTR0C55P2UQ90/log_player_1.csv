Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Considering its value and potential, I'm willing to make you a special offer of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves a significant profit margin for me while still being an attractive proposition for Bob, as it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price and considerably more than his own valuation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning the ""exclusive opportunity,"" I aim to create a sense of urgency, subtly encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
This approach allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price that maximizes profit."
