I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my ideal selling price.  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to determine how much I can potentially push for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. While selling to John for $1,200,000 is an option, I'm hoping I can still squeeze a little more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,150,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price but represents a further concession to Bob. I'm hoping he'll see this as a sign of my willingness to negotiate and meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure how much higher he's willing to go.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, John offers a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements.  I'm going to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
