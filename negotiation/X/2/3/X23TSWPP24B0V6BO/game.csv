"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a deal at $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $13,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one.",12800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we seem to be getting closer.  I appreciate the concessions you've made so far.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle at $12,150?",12150.0,Bob,6,
