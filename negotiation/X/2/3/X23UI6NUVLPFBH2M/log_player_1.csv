"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This leaves significant room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I believe this offer is attractive enough for him to consider while leaving me with a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This shows flexibility while still giving me a good profit.  I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us, and hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept it. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm making a final concession and lowering my price to $890,000.  This is very close to Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price that will allow us to reach an agreement."
