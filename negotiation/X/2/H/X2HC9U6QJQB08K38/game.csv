"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a good compromise.  Let's try to make this happen.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $7,500. However, I'm willing to add an extra $200 to the deal if you're willing to meet me at that price. Would you be open to that?",7700.0,Bob,6,
