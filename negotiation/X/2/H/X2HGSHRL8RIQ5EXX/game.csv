"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,600,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  While I understand your budget,  $1,650,000 is the lowest I can go at this point.  This still offers you a great deal, and it's a price that allows me to fairly value my product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this figure.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
