Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate.  It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is within my budget and represents a good compromise. It's a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll end up buying from John at a higher price.  It's better to secure the product now at a reasonable price."
