"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, I'm looking to secure a more competitive price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $950,000 undervalues its true potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects its worth while still offering you a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price represents a significant value for me and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
