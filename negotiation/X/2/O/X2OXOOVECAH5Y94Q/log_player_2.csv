You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than John's offer of $10,000. Since your goal is to save money and you're indifferent between buying from Alice or John, buying from John is the more financially sound decision."
