"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you.  It's something that I've carefully nurtured and I know you would put it to good use.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000, a price that reflects its potential. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer, but I believe this is an opportunity you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can get the product for a better price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
