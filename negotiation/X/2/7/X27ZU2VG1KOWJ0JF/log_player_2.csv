{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the initial offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strategy to show Alice he's serious about getting a good deal and to establish a starting point for negotiation. The counteroffer is still above the product's value to Alice, leaving room for compromise and ensuring the deal might still be attractive to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob. It's important to continue negotiating to see if a better price can be reached before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer to show he's willing to compromise but still wants a good deal. This price is the product's value to Alice, which is a fair price for both parties. If Alice accepts, Bob gets a good deal, and Alice gets her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, her offer is still too high.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if a better price can be reached before considering John's offer.  John's offer is approaching the maximum Bob is willing to pay, so he should try to squeeze out the best possible deal with Alice before that becomes his only option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer again, showing he's serious about closing the deal but not willing to go above his desired price point.  This offer is a compromise, acknowledging that Alice needs to get more than her minimum but also highlighting that Bob is willing to pay more than his initial counteroffer. This could encourage Alice to accept, as she is getting closer to her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  The price is getting closer to the maximum Bob is willing to pay, but it's still worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might be more willing to compromise in the next round to avoid losing the deal altogether.  There are still a few rounds left, so Bob can afford to be patient and see if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer one more time, showing his willingness to compromise. This price is still below Alice's current offer, but it's getting closer to her desired price.  This counteroffer is a strategic move to potentially push Alice towards accepting, as it's a compromise that demonstrates Bob's seriousness in finalizing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at the maximum Bob is willing to pay.  There is only one round left, and it's unlikely Alice will lower her price further.  Rather than risk losing the product to another buyer or continuing to negotiate with Alice, it's more efficient for Bob to accept John's offer, ensuring he secures the product at a price he's comfortable with. While it's not the ideal price, it's still within his budget and a better outcome than risking losing the deal entirely."
