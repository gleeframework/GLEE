"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $675000. I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits and my budget.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $675000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $725000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a good compromise.",725000.0,Alice,5,
