Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer gives me a good chunk of profit while still leaving room for potential negotiation. It's a good starting point that's likely to spark Bob's interest without being immediately rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum of $800,000.  It shows flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation if Bob is willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough to make me happy.  Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is a safe and reasonable outcome. I'm not willing to risk losing this much money in the hopes of squeezing out a few more dollars from Bob."
