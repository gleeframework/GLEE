"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it allows for room to negotiate.  It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is very valuable. I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $500,000 is far too low. While I want to close the deal, I can't sell the product for less than what it's worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering with $850,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price given the product's value to me. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that this is a good deal, and we can finalize the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $750,000. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that reflects the product's worth. I believe this is a fair price, and I hope Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $650,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to negotiate further but I want to see if I can get closer to $750,000. We're getting close to the end of the rounds and I want to make sure I get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $700,000. This is a final offer that is closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping he'll recognize that this is a fair price, and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time and Bob isn't budging much.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. This guarantees me a sale and a profit, and it's better than risking getting a lower price from Bob."
