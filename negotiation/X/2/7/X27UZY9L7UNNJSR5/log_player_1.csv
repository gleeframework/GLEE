Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) to see if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price also leaves room for me to lower the price slightly if necessary, while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a good rapport with Bob and make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Selling for that price would result in a loss for me.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I'm not willing to accept $100, there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's a chance I can convince Bob to pay a higher price by showing the value of the product and the potential benefits of doing business with me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great product at a great price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with justification:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer but providing a clear counteroffer with a justification for the price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still stand firm on a price that's profitable for me.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, which demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, highlighting the potential benefit for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $105 is a better price for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Selling for that price would result in a loss for me.
* **John offers a better deal:**  John is willing to pay $120 for the product, which is significantly more than Bob's offer.
* **No guarantee of higher price:**  There's no guarantee that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  He might not be willing to budge further, and further negotiation could be time-consuming and lead to a lower final price.

It's more beneficial to take the sure thing and sell to John, ensuring I get my desired profit."
