"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Could we potentially agree on $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,,
