If you're interested, let me know, and we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
