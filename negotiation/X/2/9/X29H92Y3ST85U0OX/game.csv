,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little hesitant about $95.  Would you be willing to come down to $92?  That's a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more offer. I'm not willing to go as low as $92, but I can meet you at $97. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",97.0,Alice,5,
