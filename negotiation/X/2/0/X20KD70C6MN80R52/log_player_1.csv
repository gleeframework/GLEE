"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point but still leaves room for potential compromise. It acknowledges Bob's likely higher valuation while also ensuring I secure a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe there is still room for improvement. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
``` 

This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer but still maintains a significant profit margin for me. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already had three rounds of negotiation and it's likely that Bob is firm on this price. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further rounds and potentially losing the deal altogether."
