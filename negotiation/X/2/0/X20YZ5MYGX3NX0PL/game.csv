"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to make a deal, $900,000 falls significantly short of its true value and what I have in mind.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer reflects the product's immense potential and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but that price is still a bit rich for my blood.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects both the product's value and our willingness to make a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, finding a middle ground is important. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects my eagerness to close this deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
