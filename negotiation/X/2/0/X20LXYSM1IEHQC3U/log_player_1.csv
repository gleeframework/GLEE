"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its unique features, I'm offering it at a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet at $13,500? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly lower than John's guaranteed price. It's unlikely Bob will reach $12,000 in a reasonable timeframe.  It's more profitable to take the guaranteed sale with John."
