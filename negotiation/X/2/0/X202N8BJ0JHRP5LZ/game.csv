"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, which is a significant amount considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and is a significant investment on my part. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $950,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
