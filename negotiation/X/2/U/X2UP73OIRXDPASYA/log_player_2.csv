"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $120 is still a bit high. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go any higher.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still leaves room for a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still aiming for a lower price, and $100 is still above your ideal range.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you another chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 95}
