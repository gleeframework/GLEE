Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go any higher.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still leaves room for a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $95 is a good price, and I'm not sure I can get much higher. It's also better than selling to John."
