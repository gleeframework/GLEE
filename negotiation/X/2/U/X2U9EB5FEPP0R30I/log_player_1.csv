Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still being attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $120. If he rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for $100, but I'm hoping to get a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get $115, $110 is still a good price for me and it's better than selling to John for $100. It's also likely that further negotiation would result in a lower price for me, so accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option."
