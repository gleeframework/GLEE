"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900000 is simply too low for me. The value of this product is significantly higher than that.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1050000. This is a fair price that takes your interests into account while still allowing me to make a profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
