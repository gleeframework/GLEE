"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Can you consider that?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $15000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $17500? It's still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $17500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. Can you consider that?,16000.0,Bob,4,
