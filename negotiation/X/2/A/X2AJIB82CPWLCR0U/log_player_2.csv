Bob should reject the offer. While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject the offer. He can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as her offer is still above his desired price. It's possible that Alice might be willing to come down further to secure the sale."

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still above his ideal price, it's only $65,000 more than his maximum budget and the negotiation seems to be nearing a compromise.  It's likely that Alice won't go lower, and it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal.  Buying from John would save him $65,000, but it's not guaranteed that he can negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Accepting Alice's offer provides a reasonably good deal and ensures he gets the product."
