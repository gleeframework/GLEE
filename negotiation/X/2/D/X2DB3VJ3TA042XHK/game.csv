"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment. Would you like to make an offer of $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,000,000. It's a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $950,000. I think this is a fair price that we can both agree on. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
