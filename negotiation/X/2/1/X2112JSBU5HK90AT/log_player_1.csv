Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity with significant value, and I believe it would be a great asset for you. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to me. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your product's value, but $1,100,000 is still out of my range. Let's try $950,000. It's a significant step closer to my budget, and hopefully, we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal.  I'm not yet willing to settle for $950,000, especially since John is willing to pay $1,000,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer, I can't go that low. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as John's offer, and since I need to make a decision now, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
