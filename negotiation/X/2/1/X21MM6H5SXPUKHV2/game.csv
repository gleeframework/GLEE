"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $90 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $75.  Would you be willing to consider that?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $82.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
