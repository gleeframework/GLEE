"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point. He has room to negotiate and should reject the offer, aiming for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value. 
* **Reasoned justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, suggesting a willingness to negotiate but also establishing a clear price point.
* **Sets the stage for further negotiation:** This counteroffer opens the door for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $850,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still likely get a better deal. 
* **Potential for a better price:**  Alice is willing to negotiate, so Bob should continue to try to lower the price.
* **Avoiding overpaying:** Bob is very price-sensitive, and accepting now would mean paying more than he wants to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong position:** Bob is now very close to his ideal price and is showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to Alice's interests:** Bob emphasizes that this price is fair and beneficial for both of them, creating a win-win scenario.
* **Urgency:** The message suggests a desire to close the deal quickly, which could add pressure to Alice."
