Explanation:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet Alice's minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate or a final offer too far below Alice's value. John offers a guaranteed sale at Alice's desired price, making it the most logical choice."
