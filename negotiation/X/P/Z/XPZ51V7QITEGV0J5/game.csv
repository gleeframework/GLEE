"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",170.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $155, which is a great compromise. This way, you'll still get a great deal, and I'll make a decent profit. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I can do $142.50, which is a compromise that I think is fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a decent profit. What do you think?",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $137.50. Can you consider that?",137.5,Bob,6,
