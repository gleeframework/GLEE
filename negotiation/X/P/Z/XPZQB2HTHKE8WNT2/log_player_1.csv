"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm not desperate enough to settle for $9,000 when I know I can get $10,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my desired $10,000 than my minimum, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
