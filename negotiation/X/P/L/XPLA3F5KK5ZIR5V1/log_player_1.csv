"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for potential negotiation room and ensures I get a good starting point.  I'm confident in the product's value, and I'm hoping Bob sees the potential and is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see how Bob reacts."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm countering with $18,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still being above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $17,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and significantly higher than my minimum.  It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
