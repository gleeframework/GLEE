Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, offering it slightly below his valuation maximizes your potential profit while still ensuring he gets a perceived deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, the slight buffer below Bob's valuation allows room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price too close to $12,000 might discourage Bob, pushing him to reject the offer. By presenting a price that seems like a good deal, you increase the likelihood of a successful sale. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price and securing a sale with Bob, rather than resorting to John's guaranteed but lower offer."
