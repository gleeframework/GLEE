"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on it. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm offering the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value and potential you'll gain from it. Let's try to find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
