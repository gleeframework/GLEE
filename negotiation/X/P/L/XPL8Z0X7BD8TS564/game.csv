"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and your desire for a good return. I look forward to your response.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",1380000.0,Alice,3,
