"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the significant value it will bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,800,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for significantly less.  It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $1,500,000 is still above Bob's desired price point. He's already made his maximum offer, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
