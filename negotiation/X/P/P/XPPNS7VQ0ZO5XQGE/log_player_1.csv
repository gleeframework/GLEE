Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation if he rejects it. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $135 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a really good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $128. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $128 is still below my minimum price of $150.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm confident I can get my full price from John. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with less than I'm aiming for.  I'll go with the guaranteed sale to John."
