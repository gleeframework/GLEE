Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This price reflects its quality and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, knowing that the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights the potential value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while also being open to a negotiation that might lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if that's a possibility. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is too far off.  Rejecting it allows me to counteroffer and potentially find a middle ground that is more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to see if we can find a deal. This still represents a significant value for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $12,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $12,000, the product still represents significant value.
* **Openness:** The message again conveys my willingness to negotiate further. 

This approach attempts to find a middle ground that balances my need to make a profit with the need to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $8,000 offer, which is far below my minimum price of $15,000. Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better result, and I'm unwilling to sell the product for such a low price.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the best option in this situation, as it guarantees me a fair price and avoids further unproductive negotiation."
