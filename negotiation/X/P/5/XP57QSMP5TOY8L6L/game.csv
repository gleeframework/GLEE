"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",18000.0,Alice,3,
