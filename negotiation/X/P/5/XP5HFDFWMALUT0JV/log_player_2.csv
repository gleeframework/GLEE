Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go up to $75, but I'm willing to meet you at $85. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $85 is getting closer to your $80 limit, she has stated it's her final offer.  You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $80. It's better to secure the deal with John and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
