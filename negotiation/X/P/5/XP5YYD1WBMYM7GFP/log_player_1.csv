Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $130 is above your minimum price of $100, but still below Bob's perceived value of $150. 
* **Shows you're open to a deal:** The message is friendly and inviting.
* **Gives you a good baseline:**  You can adjust your price based on Bob's response. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to your minimum price but still above your desired earnings.  Since you're aiming for as much money as possible, rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $127.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 127.50} 
```
 
This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:** It's a slight move towards Bob's price, showing you're willing to work with him.
* **Highlights value:**  It emphasizes your confidence in the product's worth.
* **Remains above your minimum:**  You're still aiming to get more than your $100 minimum.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125 again? I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, and we've already gone through a round of counter-offers.  At this point, accepting his offer is the best choice. You're still earning more than your minimum price of $100, and continued negotiation might only lead to further delays without guaranteeing a higher price. It's important to weigh the potential gains against the time investment in negotiations."
