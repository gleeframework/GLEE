Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, while still keeping the price well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept a higher price.

**Why not higher?**

Going too close to $1,000,000 might make Bob feel like he has no room to negotiate and could lead to an immediate rejection."
