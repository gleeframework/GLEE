Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant amount for me and leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a good price.  I believe Bob is likely to accept, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is still a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000.  This is a compromise that is still profitable for me, but closer to Bob's offer.  I hope he will accept it, as it's a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $960,000 is still a good deal and close enough to my target to make it worthwhile.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether and forcing me to accept John's lower offer."
