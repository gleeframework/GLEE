Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit under my minimum, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $8,500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal.  You'll save $500 and avoid further negotiation."
