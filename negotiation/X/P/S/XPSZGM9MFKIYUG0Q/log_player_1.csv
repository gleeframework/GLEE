"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but within a range that Bob might consider, given his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Setting the Tone:** The message is friendly but firm, establishing my position as the seller and highlighting the product's worth. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If negotiations stall, I'll consider selling to John to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is good, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  It's also far below the value Bob himself perceives ($800,000). 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it opens the door for further negotiation. I believe there's still room to find a price that benefits both of us.
* **Selling to John is a Safety Net:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll aim for a price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's limited budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is too far below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  considering your interest. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still considerably higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Acknowledging Bob's Budget:** I've demonstrated flexibility by coming down in price, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth while emphasizing a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to reconsider my strategy. If he accepts, I've secured a good price.  If negotiations continue, I'll remain open to further negotiation, keeping my minimum value and John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my initial asking price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room for a better offer.
* **Protecting My Interests:**  Selling to John at this point would secure my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum. I'll aim for a price that reflects the product's value while also considering Bob's perceived value and his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $850,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final counteroffer, conveying a sense of urgency and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Near My Minimum:**  $850,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, allowing for a small profit while still being competitive.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's worth and the opportunity for a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept or Reject:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to sell to John or continue negotiating.
* **Weighing Options:** If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider John's offer against the potential of further negotiation with Bob. Time is running out, and I need to make a strategic decision."
