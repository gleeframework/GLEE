Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a great deal, as you know the value is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't commit to $1,150,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I know the product is worth more to him, and I have 8 more rounds to try and close a deal.  Selling to John now would mean losing out on a potential $50,000 profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still gives you a significant advantage. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
