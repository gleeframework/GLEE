"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Bob to see the value in the product.  It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit, but also to leave room for negotiation in case Bob is willing to pay less.  I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob seems determined to stick to his initial offer.  I'm still hoping to get a higher price, so I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be strategic with my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,300,000.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still trying to secure a price closer to my desired value. With only a few rounds left, I need to be more flexible while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price. With only four rounds left, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers.  I'm better off taking this offer and securing a sale.  I can always try to find a better deal with a different buyer in the future."
