"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me, and gives us both a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This still reflects the significant intrinsic value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the product's value to me.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
