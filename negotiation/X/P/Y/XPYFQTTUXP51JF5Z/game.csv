"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about $90 for the product?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $80 is the absolute highest I could go.  Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's still a good price for you, and it's worth it to me to sell the product to someone who's really interested in it.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $82.50?",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob! Meeting halfway between $85 and $80 is a great compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $83.50. It's a small increase, but it's worth it to me to get the price I want.",83.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $82 for the product, but that's the absolute limit for me.",82.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $83.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",83.5,Alice,9,
