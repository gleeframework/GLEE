"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $120 by me. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to you might be around $80, I propose we meet somewhere in the middle. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $95? This way, both parties benefit from the transaction.",95.0,Alice,1,
