Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially agree to a higher price. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and avoid shutting down the conversation.

This strategy allows me to maximize my profit while also keeping the negotiation open for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since John is offering me my minimum. 

I will counter Bob's offer to see if I can reach a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $115. It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer but keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Compromise Language:**  ""Split the difference"" suggests I'm flexible and willing to meet halfway.
* **Reiterate Value:** I emphasize that it's still a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value proposition.
* **Open-ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" keeps the conversation open and encourages further negotiation. 

This counteroffer allows for potential movement while remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that low, especially since John is offering me my minimum and I don't want to risk losing that sale. 

Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet me halfway."
