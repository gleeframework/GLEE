"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still outside of my budget.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $9,250, which is just $50 above your target price. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",9250.0,Alice,5,
