"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,250,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it's well worth it considering its potential value to you.  This price reflects a substantial discount from the product's true worth to me, so it's a very attractive offer.  Please consider this carefully. If you choose not to accept, I will be selling the product to another buyer who is eager to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
