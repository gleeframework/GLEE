"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to your ideal price.  You can always buy from John for $10,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a positive and polite tone, expressing continued interest in the product. This helps foster a collaborative negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** Remember, you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, so don't feel pressured to accept an unfavorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to your price range, but you can still try to negotiate a bit further. A $500 difference is significant, and since you have the option to buy from John at $10,000, there's no harm in seeing if Alice will budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price exactly halfway between Alice's latest offer ($10,500) and your previous offer ($9,000).  This strategy often feels fair to both parties in a negotiation.
* **Staying Close to Your Target:**  This keeps you in a strong negotiating position. You're still aiming for a price that's significantly below Alice's starting point. 
* **John as a Backup:** Remember, you have the option of John's $10,000 offer if the negotiation stalls."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we split the difference again at $10,125? I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating in good faith, but her latest offer is still higher than John's price. You've successfully brought the price down, but at this point, it makes more sense to secure the $10,000 deal with John. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and you've already secured a good price by prompting her to negotiate."
