"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $90 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum of $100, I'm still losing $15. I'm willing to try and negotiate further, as there are still more rounds and I can always sell to John for $100 if I don't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $88?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88}
