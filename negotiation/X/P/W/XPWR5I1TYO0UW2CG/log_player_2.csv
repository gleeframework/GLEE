"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than Bob's maximum, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to $80, the value Alice places on the product.  Offering $90 is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get a better deal than $95. While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a lower price and avoids the risk of accepting a deal that isn't optimal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $90 and Alice's latest offer of $95.  Offering $92 shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below his maximum.  The closer the offers are, the more likely Alice is to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected a $95 offer and made a counteroffer of $92, but Alice is now offering $97. This is a slight increase, but still significantly lower than the $120 Bob would pay John.  

Considering he has limited rounds, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product for a price within his budget rather than risk further negotiations that might not result in a better price."
