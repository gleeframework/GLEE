"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. Can you meet me halfway?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet at $8250?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we meet at $7750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $7750. How about we meet at $8000? I'm willing to sell it to you for the minimum price I need to make it worthwhile, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
