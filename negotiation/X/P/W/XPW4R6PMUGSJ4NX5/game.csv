"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it would be highly valuable for your business. My initial price is $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this price still reflects the value of the product while accommodating your budget.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there with $1,200,000. It's important for me to get a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and leaves room for both of us to gain from this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise for me. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a price that allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  While $1,350,000 is tempting, I'm still working with a tight budget. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,325,000. This is my absolute maximum, and it would be a great deal for both of us. I'm ready to close this deal right now if you agree.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
