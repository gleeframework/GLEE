"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is really interesting, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I can always sell to John for that price.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."

This is a good compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $100. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a revised offer of $95. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to be at $95.  This is my absolute best offer, and it's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're making a final concession, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, which would be $92.50. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm running out of time, and I'm not confident that I can get Bob to agree to a price that's at least $120. I've already made several concessions, and his counteroffers are still below my minimum. To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed $120, I will sell the product to John."
