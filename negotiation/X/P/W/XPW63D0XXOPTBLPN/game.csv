"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is really interesting, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider this offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $90 is still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to receive.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above a certain point. How about $100? This is a good compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $100. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a revised offer of $95. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. This would be a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",97.5,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to be at $95.  This is my absolute best offer, and it's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're making a final concession, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, which would be $92.50. Can you consider this offer?",92.5,Bob,8,
