"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is too far below the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $775,000? It's a fair price that considers your needs and my investment in this product.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $775,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet closer to my offer, perhaps at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
