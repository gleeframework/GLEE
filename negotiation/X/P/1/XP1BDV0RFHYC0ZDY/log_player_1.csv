Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and open tone to encourage a successful negotiation.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup, giving me the confidence to walk away if the deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and even lower than what John is willing to pay.  While I am interested in selling to Bob, I want to try to get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is too far below the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $775,000? It's a fair price that considers your needs and my investment in this product.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that $775,000 is a ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Confidence:** I express confidence in reaching a deal at this price, encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Note:** While $775,000 is still higher than John's offer, I'm trying to maximize my profit while still keeping the negotiation open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $775,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet closer to my offer, perhaps at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some flexibility, his offer of $725,000 is still below what John is willing to pay.  At this point, the negotiation is taking time and I'm not seeing a clear path to reaching a price that meets my minimum requirement.  Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is a safer and faster outcome."
