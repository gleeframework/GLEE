"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, and it allows you to make a substantial profit.  I believe this is a win-win situation.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. You know you have a backup option and can try to get a better deal from Alice."
