Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $9,000. I believe it will be very beneficial for you, and this is a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $10,000, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might result in a quicker sale and still leave me with a good profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,000 is a price point that's attractive to Bob (as it's less than his perceived value) while still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob doesn't immediately accept $9,000, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price that works for both of us."
