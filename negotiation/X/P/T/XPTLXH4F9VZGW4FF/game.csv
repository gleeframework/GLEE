"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,100,000?  I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,050,000.  However, I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet at $1,100,000? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $1,100,000. I think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. How about we meet at $1,020,000? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I need to stay within my budget",1020000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, $1,020,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,070,000? I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,070,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,020,000 and $1,070,000, which would be $1,045,000. Can you consider that?",1045000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,045,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about $1,060,000?  That's just a small step further, and I think it would be a fair price for both of us.",1060000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,045,000. I think that's the maximum I can afford, and I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. Can you meet me at $1,045,000 or is that a non-negotiable price for you?",1045000.0,Bob,10,
