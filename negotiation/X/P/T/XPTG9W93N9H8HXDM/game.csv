"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
