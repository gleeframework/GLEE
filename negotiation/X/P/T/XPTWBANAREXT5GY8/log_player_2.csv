"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.

You're still trying to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still above your target. Let's see if we can get Alice down to $105."
