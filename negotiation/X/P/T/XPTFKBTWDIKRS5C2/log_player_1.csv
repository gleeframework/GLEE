Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it offers significant value, but let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I can afford to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above my minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to be polite and open-ended. Bob's response will give me insight into how interested he is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts the $19,000 offer, I make a significant profit. If he negotiates down, I can still potentially get a price higher than $15,000. If he rejects the offer entirely, I can move on to John with no loss."
