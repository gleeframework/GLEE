"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer.  You can always buy from John, so you have leverage to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20%) is a good strategy. It shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and sets a clear expectation. This also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further.  Remember, you have the option of buying from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice came down to $135, it shows she's willing to negotiate. A small counter-offer of $130 keeps the negotiation moving and demonstrates your continued willingness to compromise, potentially pushing Alice closer to your target price."
