"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of its value. After considering your proposal, I am unable to match the price you've suggested. However, I would like to extend an offer of $825,000 for the product. This is the highest price I can offer while still ensuring a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
