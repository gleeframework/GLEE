"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $115. Let's meet in the middle!",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",125.0,Alice,5,
