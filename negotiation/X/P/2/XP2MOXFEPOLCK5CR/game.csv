"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. While I recognize its value, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise, reflecting both its value and your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair price considering my constraints. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to a realistic valuation, it's still below my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000 as my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
