"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'll propose $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting the price I want. I'll meet you at $1,100,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
