"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range. 
* Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, and Bob could end up having to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
