{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is closer to Bob's perceived value, but still gives me room to negotiate upwards. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and show I'm willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to Bob's perceived value of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
