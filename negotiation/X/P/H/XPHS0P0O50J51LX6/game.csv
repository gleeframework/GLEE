"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $120. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you pointing out the value to me, but $170 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm happy to pay up to $120 for this product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $145. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $120. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really only able to pay $130.  If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to buy. ",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $140. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $120. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
