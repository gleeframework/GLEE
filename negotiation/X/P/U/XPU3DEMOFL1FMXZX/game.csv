"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. I believe this price reflects its true value, but I'm open to negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle, though. My revised offer is $9,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to consider it.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to settle for $7,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, and I'm willing to consider your offer of $7,000. However, I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I can meet you at $8,200. I think this is a fair price that's closer to my minimum, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",8200.0,Alice,5,
