"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,050,000 is still pushing my budget.  I could do $950,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
