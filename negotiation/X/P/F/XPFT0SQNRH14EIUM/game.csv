"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
