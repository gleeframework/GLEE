"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer is far above your maximum price. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that you see its value. However, I was expecting a higher offer from you. Considering your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1400000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, given the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, I need to make a profit, and $1100000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Since you have a guaranteed option with John, it's more financially sound to go with that deal."
