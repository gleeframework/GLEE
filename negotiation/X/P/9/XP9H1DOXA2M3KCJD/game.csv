"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. This reflects the value I see in the product and is the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that you see its value. However, I was expecting a higher offer from you. Considering your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1400000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, given the product's worth to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but my maximum offer remains $1100000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, I need to make a profit, and $1100000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
