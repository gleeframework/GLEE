Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal to someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  A high initial offer allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This strategy maximizes potential profit while still leaving you the option to accept his counter-offer if it's closer to your desired price.
* **Value justification:**  The message hints at the product's value (""worth a great deal"")  to justify the high price without revealing specifics about the guaranteed sale to John. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Gauging your buyer and adjusting your strategy based on their personality and negotiation style is key in real-world scenarios."
