Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,190,000. I know this product can significantly benefit you, and I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment at this price."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my valuation. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,190,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as an investment, potentially making it more appealing to Bob. 

**If Bob rejects the offer:** I'll proceed to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
