{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  I propose a price of $1250000. This represents a good compromise, and it's still a price that is worth it for you, given the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer than her initial offer, it's still not worth accepting. You should continue negotiating and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and it's a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $1150000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $1200000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now exactly at your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's not ideal, but it's a fair price and allows you to buy the product within your limit. There's no guarantee you'll get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, and you risk losing the product to someone else. Accepting the offer is the best option in this round."
