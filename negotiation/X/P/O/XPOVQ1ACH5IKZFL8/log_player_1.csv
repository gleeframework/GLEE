""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a faster sale and still yield a substantial profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets a $450,000 discount from the product's worth to him, incentivizing him to buy.  I secure a profit of $450,000, which is a significant sum. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slightly lower price, could be more advantageous than waiting for the guaranteed sale to John. 

By starting with this offer, I leave room for potential negotiation while still prioritizing my goal of maximizing profit."
