"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum value ($150) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum value of $150. This is a fair price considering the product is worth more to me than to Bob, and it gives him a chance to get the product at a price closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below the $150 I can get from John.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140, which is still above Bob's last offer but lower than my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving up the profit I could get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging much and we are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150.  While I was hoping to get more, this is still my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal with Bob."
