Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'm going to try and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer. I'm hoping this will be a good balance to get the deal closed."
