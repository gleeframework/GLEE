Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point, as it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $12,000. This leaves some wiggle room for counteroffers.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence in negotiating with Bob. If he rejects my offer, I can always fall back on John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest. I can use this opportunity to negotiate a higher price.
* **John provides leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer strengthens my position. If I can't get a better price from Bob, I have a guaranteed sale for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on value.
* **Maintain pressure:** By offering a counter, I maintain the negotiation momentum and show Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $13000. Can you meet me at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $13,000 is still below my ideal price of $15,000, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for a quick sale:** Accepting Bob's offer allows for a quick sale and avoids further negotiation rounds.
* **John as backup:** Even if I accept Bob's offer, I still have John as a backup buyer, giving me flexibility if something goes wrong."
