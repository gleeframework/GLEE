"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm asking for $200 for it. It's a steal, considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I think the product is overpriced at $200.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that's significantly lower than the original offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is way too low for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $170. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's counteroffer of $170 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price of $120.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate a better price. I'll offer a price that's even lower than my previous counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $120 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $140, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one last attempt to negotiate a better price. Since I've already offered $120 and Alice has rejected it, I'll try to meet her at a price that's close to her last offer, but still below it.

{""message"": ""I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I really need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Can you meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
