"Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm asking for $200 for it. It's a steal, considering its value. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is way too low for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $170. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $120 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $140, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I really need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Can you meet me at this price?",130.0,Bob,6,
