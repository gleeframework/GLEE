"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. While the product is worth significantly more to me, I'm willing to negotiate to ensure we both get a good deal. If you're not interested, I have another buyer who's willing to pay full price. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
