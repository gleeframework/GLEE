Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find it's worth the value, especially considering its benefits to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $119, you are leaving Bob with a small profit margin ($1), which makes it highly likely he will accept the offer. This price also maximizes your profit compared to accepting John's offer of $100."
