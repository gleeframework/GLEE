Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price in this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. This avoids the risk of him rejecting your offer and forcing you to John.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to discuss this product with you. It offers significant potential, and I know you've been looking for something like this. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  I believe this price reflects its true value and offers a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
} 
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point within the ZOPA, leaving room for potential negotiation if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's potential benefits reinforces its value in Bob's mind.
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:** This positions your price not as a hard demand, but as a starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. How you respond will depend on your negotiation style and Bob's counter-proposal."
