Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, and I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'm going to try to push for a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,500 just doesn't work for me. How about we settle on $14,500? It's a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Bob's offer of $14,000 is still too low for me, and I'm not sure if we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
