"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm asking for $1,400,000, which reflects its true worth.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's product is likely valuable, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows him to purchase the same product from John for a significantly lower price."
