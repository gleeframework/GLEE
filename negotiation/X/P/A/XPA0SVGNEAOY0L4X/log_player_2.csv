"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for a little less than what I'd get from someone else.  Would you be interested in buying it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and securing the lower price."
