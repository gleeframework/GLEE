Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer, along with the offer itself:

**Reasoning**

* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Alice has a safety net â€“ John will buy the product for $1,000,000. This means Alice should accept nothing less than this amount.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  Alice needs to offer a price lower than this for Bob to even consider it.
* **Negotiation Power:** Alice has the upper hand. She knows Bob's maximum and has a guaranteed buyer.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and to streamline the process, I'm willing to accept a price of $900,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I have another buyer ready to proceed at my desired price."", 
""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable:** The offered price ($900,000) is below John's offer and above Bob's valuation, giving room for negotiation while still aiming high.
* **Deadline:** Creating a sense of urgency encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents stalling.
* **Confidence:** The message implies other interested buyers, strengthening Alice's position without revealing the guaranteed sale to John. 

**Important Note:** Alice should be prepared to walk away if Bob tries to negotiate below $1,000,000. She holds the stronger position in this scenario."
