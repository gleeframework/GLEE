"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a high but not outrageous offer anchors the negotiation in our favor. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves ample room for negotiation while staying significantly above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message aims to be collaborative and positive, emphasizing the product's value and our willingness to discuss.

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the option of John's guaranteed offer on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value to me. This is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While it's a step in the right direction, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate, especially since we have John's offer as a safety net. We'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is considerably lower than what I had in mind.  To be fair, let's meet closer to the middle. How about $2,000,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession by dropping $300,000, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate while still staying well above Bob's offer.
* **Justified Value:** We reiterate the product's value to anchor the price in Bob's mind.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  Framing our counteroffer as a ""middle ground"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a similarly substantial move upwards.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving and maintains pressure on Bob to increase his offer significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to a price we can both agree on. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to our guaranteed sale price with John. However, we are still in a strong position to negotiate further. We've consistently moved down while Bob has significantly increased his offer. This indicates we can likely secure a better deal than $1,400,000. We'll counter with an offer closer to $1,500,000, putting some pressure on Bob while still leaving us with the option of John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To bridge the gap, let's settle on $1,800,000. This reflects the value this product brings and allows us to finalize the deal."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our counteroffer by a smaller amount this time ($200,000), signaling that we're approaching our desired price point.
* **Finality:** The language used suggests we're nearing the end of negotiations and encourages Bob to take this offer seriously.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps us significantly above Bob's last offer while still providing some room for negotiation if needed before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's aim for a final price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a strong deal for us. It exceeds our guaranteed offer from John by $100,000. While we could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation wouldn't yield a significantly better result. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and brings a successful conclusion to the negotiation."
