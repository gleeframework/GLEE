"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value to me. This is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is considerably lower than what I had in mind.  To be fair, let's meet closer to the middle. How about $2,000,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to a price we can both agree on. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To bridge the gap, let's settle on $1,800,000. This reflects the value this product brings and allows us to finalize the deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's aim for a final price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
