"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting high, at 1.5 million dollars. This sets the bar for the negotiation and allows for potential room to come down. 
* I'm not starting at the absolute maximum I'd be willing to accept, as that would leave no room for negotiation. 
* This offer is bold and demonstrates confidence in the value of the product. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. The negotiation will depend heavily on Bob's response and how I assess his interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial price of $1,500,000.  
* I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for the minimum right away. 
* By rejecting this offer, I can gauge Bob's true interest and potentially drive a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* This shows a willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial valuation.
* This counter-offer demonstrates a strategic approach to negotiation, showing a willingness to meet halfway while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob has moved closer to my valuation, and his offer is now only $100,000 below my initial price.
* With each round, the risk of a deal falling through increases.
* While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer is a good strategic move. It secures a strong price and allows me to move on. 
* Selling to John would only net me $1,000,000, whereas accepting this offer earns me $100,000 more."
