"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $18,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's a good middle ground that would allow us to both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000, which is $13,500. I hope this is a more reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my preferred price point. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  At this point, it might be worth considering buying from John for a guaranteed price of $10,000, but I'm hoping to secure a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it would be a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $12,500, which is $13,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high for me.  While we've made progress in the negotiation, it's unlikely that Alice will go lower than $13,000. At this point, it's better to buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
