Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's value to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or accept a counteroffer.  However, if he's willing to pay, I'll be able to earn a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm sticking to my guns and offering the product for $1,200,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it represents the product's value to me.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept my offer. If he doesn't, I can always turn to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
