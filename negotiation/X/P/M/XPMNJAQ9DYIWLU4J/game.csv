"I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a profit.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we bring the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within a budget, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about we try $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we try $10,750? It's still a good price for me, and it's a bit more in line with the value it holds for you.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  To be honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $10,000.  If you can meet that, I'll buy it from you today.  Otherwise, I may need to go with the other option.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you have other options, Bob, but I'd like to remind you that this product is unique and has its own value. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's the best I can do.",10250.0,Alice,7,
