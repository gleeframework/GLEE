"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  $9,000 is still higher than the product's worth to you, and there are more rounds to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500, which is a bit more than Alice's value for the product but still well within your budget. This should hopefully make it appealing for her while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still a bit high, and we're only on round 3. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if we can get her closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $8,750. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm still trying to get a good deal.  We're halfway through the rounds, so it's important to keep making progress."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting higher, which is not ideal. However, it's still worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John. We have a few rounds left, and a counteroffer could potentially lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

This time I'm going to offer $8,800.  This is a small increase from the last offer, showing Alice that I'm committed to a deal, but still trying to keep the price within a reasonable range. With only a few rounds remaining, it's important to keep the pressure on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable, but we still have a couple of rounds left to try and negotiate.  It's worth one more attempt at a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise before having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm increasing the offer again to $8,900. This is a significant increase from the previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product.  With only two rounds remaining, it's crucial to make a strong final push. If Alice rejects this offer, we'll need to decide whether to buy from John or accept a final offer from Alice in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting higher, and we're in the final round.  It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that's satisfactory to me, and I'm getting close to my limit with John.  It's time to buy from John and avoid potentially risking a last-minute deal with Alice that could be worse."
