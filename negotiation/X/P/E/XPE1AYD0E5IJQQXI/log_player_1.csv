{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It is above my minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.  It's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value to Bob while giving me room to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let the product go for that price. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
