Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to sacrifice any more value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $650,000 and $625,000. I'm offering the product to you for $637,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $637,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $637,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final offer.  The difference between her offer ($637,500) and my desired price is getting smaller, and I risk her walking away entirely. Accepting this offer secures a significant savings compared to John's price."
