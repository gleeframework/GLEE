Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $500,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $600,000?  That would seal the deal for me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
