Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is closer to my desired price of $12,000. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not happy with the price. 
* **Plan B:** I have the option of selling to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still below what I want to receive. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I can still counter-offer and potentially get a price closer to my target. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory price, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're trying to get the best price possible. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,750, which is a fair compromise. This reflects the value of the product and also gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining value:**  $10,750 is still above my minimum price of $12,000, which allows me to potentially get a better deal.
* **Maintaining negotiation:** I'm still open to negotiation, hoping to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
