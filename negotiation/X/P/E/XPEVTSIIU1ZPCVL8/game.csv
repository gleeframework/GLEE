"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're trying to get the best price possible. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,750, which is a fair compromise. This reflects the value of the product and also gives you a good deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,
