"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still do better.  He knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're trying to get the best price possible. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,750, which is a fair compromise. This reflects the value of the product and also gives you a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,750 is still higher than what Bob can get from John for $10,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks further lowering the price but also risks Alice backing out of the deal entirely. Since Bob has a guaranteed deal with John, it's the most logical choice to secure the product at the lowest possible price."
