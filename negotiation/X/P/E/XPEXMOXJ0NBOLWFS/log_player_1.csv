```

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $1,500,000 as possible.

# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. 

**Strategy:**

* By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation.
* I will counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to secure a deal that benefits me more.
* I'm still open to selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. Let's try $1,600,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product is worth every penny.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still within a range that I believe is reasonable for both parties. I'm aiming to find a middle ground while still securing a profit closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and encouraging Bob to consider my offer, emphasizing the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

* By rejecting Bob's offer and countering with a price closer to my minimum value, I'm demonstrating my commitment to achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.
* This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also signals that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my desired value.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll consider adjusting my price further or selling to John, depending on the circumstances and the remaining rounds."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,550,000?  This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't regret this purchase. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only four rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm running out of time and the potential for a deal with Bob seems unlikely. 

**Strategy:**

* It's time to secure the guaranteed deal with John.  He's willing to pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* Selling to John guarantees me a profit, even if it's not as high as I initially hoped for.  It's the most sensible choice considering the remaining rounds and the potential for further deadlock with Bob."
