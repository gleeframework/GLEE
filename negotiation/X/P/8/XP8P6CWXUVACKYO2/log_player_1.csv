Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value. This is a calculated risk, as Bob might reject it outright. However, it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 

I'm also confident that I can get at least $12,000 from John, so I don't have to settle for anything less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering $14,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, $13,000 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $12,000. It's important to recognize that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, and I'm willing to close the deal to secure the profit."
