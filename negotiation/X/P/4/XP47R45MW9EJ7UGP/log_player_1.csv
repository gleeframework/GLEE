Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially faster sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still represents a good deal compared to John's offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't come across as an ultimatum.  There's room for Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price."
