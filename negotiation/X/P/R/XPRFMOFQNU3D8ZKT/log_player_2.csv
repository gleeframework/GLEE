"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to pursue. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's a significant gap between her offer and her minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would still leave you with a healthy profit, and it's a fair price considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves room for profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her original offer but still above Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $75,000 compared to buying from John, while still getting a decent price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
