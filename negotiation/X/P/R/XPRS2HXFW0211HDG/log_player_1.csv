Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a bit higher than Bob's value, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I'm willing to go lower, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm offering $160. This is a compromise - it's more than Bob's offer but less than my initial price. Hopefully, this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come up a bit."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell to John. While I would have liked to get closer to my desired price, Bob seems set on $150. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so it's the most logical choice."
