"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is far too high.  Bob's maximum budget is $8,000, so accepting this offer would be a significant loss.  It's better to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000.  I'm willing to start with an offer of $8,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it can bring you significant benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's budget of $8,000.  While she has moved closer, it's still not a feasible price for Bob.  He should continue to negotiate and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $18,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I value meeting the needs of my customers, $10,000 is still too low for me to consider.  If we could agree on $14,000, I'd be willing to close the deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her offer of $14,000 is still well above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to try to negotiate a lower price, as he has the option of buying from John for $8,000 if he can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, so I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
