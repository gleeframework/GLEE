"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a competitive price for a product of this quality.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing us both to make a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate that. To be honest, $8,750 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $8,900, but that's my final offer.  This is a high-quality product, and you won't regret this investment.",8900.0,Alice,5,
