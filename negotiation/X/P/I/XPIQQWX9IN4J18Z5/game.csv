"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
