"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $115 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, how about $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's value of the product but still leaves us room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  We're getting closer, but let's see if we can push a bit further down before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $107?"", 
""product_price"": 107
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our last counter-offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards our desired price range."
