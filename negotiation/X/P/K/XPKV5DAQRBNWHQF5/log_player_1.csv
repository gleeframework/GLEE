Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters.  It's also a good starting point to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum price and shows I'm willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him.  John is a guaranteed $12,000, so I'll sell to him."
