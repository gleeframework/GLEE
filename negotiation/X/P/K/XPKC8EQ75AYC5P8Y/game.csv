"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,400,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,300,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,125,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,125,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not convinced that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
