Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,300,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,125,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,125,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not convinced that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,275,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
