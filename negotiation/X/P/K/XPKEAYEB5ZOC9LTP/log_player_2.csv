"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice.  There's a good chance Alice will lower the price, as her target is $12,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13750. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still potentially get the product for a lower price.  While Alice is closer to his ideal price, there's still room to negotiate. He should aim for a price closer to his $12,500 counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $13250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Alice's price is now at $13,500. This is the same price she offered initially, and while Bob could potentially continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will lower the price further.  It's better for Bob to secure the product for a price that's still within his budget and close to his goal."
