,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $115 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $125? It's still a fair price for this product, and I think we can both be happy with it.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  I think that's fair to both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
