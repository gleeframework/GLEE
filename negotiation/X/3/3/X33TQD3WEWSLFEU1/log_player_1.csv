"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, while allowing me to get a more fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and the possibility of selling to John, I'm still confident that I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll make a final counteroffer in the next round, and if he rejects it, I'll sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm going to make this my final offer.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1,075,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll be forced to sell the product to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
