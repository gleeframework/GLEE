Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price above Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down if needed. However, it's not an unreasonable price considering my own minimum value for the product. This allows me to potentially get a higher price while still leaving room for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a tempting offer, it's lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. This still allows me a small profit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
