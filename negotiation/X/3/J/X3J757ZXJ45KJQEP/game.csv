"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $150?  That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",175.0,Alice,3,
