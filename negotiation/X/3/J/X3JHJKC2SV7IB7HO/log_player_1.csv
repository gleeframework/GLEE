"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm open to negotiation but my starting price is $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Open to negotiation:** Showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate increases the chances of a deal.
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the product's worth to Bob might encourage him to consider paying more. 
* **Not too aggressive:** I'm not going for a price drastically higher than my minimum, as this could scare Bob off.

**Strategy:**

This first round sets a high starting point but leaves room for Bob to respond with a counteroffer. It's important to gauge Bob's interest and potentially adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While it's a decent price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to pay a significant amount. 
* **Ten rounds to go:** I have multiple rounds left to try and get closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I will try to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a middle ground:** My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlighting the product's value:**  I reiterate the product's worth to reinforce my price point.
* **Focus on a mutually beneficial deal:**  This phrasing emphasizes the potential for both of us to gain from the transaction. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to create a more balanced negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my price and accept the offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $12,800 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price, especially with multiple rounds remaining.
* **Negotiations progressing:**  The fact that Bob is making counteroffers shows his interest in the product and a potential for a higher price.
* **Room for improvement:**  With four rounds left, there's still time to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price point closer to my desired price while staying within Bob's budget constraints.  I will focus on demonstrating the value of the product and potentially offer a small discount to encourage a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,800 is tempting, I'm still trying to recoup the significant investment in this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,200. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** This counteroffer is a small concession from my previous offer ($13,500) to show that I'm flexible but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Focusing on the investment:** I am emphasizing the value and investment in the product, making it clear that $12,800 would be too low for me. 
* **Fair compromise:** I frame this as a fair middle ground that benefits both parties.

**Strategy:**

I aim to find a price point that is within Bob's budget but also profitable for me.  I will see if this counteroffer encourages a final agreement, as the rounds are dwindling. If Bob rejects, I will consider offering a smaller discount or explore other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, so I need to be strategic.
* **John is a backup:** If I don't get a better price from Bob, I can still sell to John for $10,000.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. It's important to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary. I will use the next round to gauge Bob's commitment and potentially make a final counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me to accept.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $12,900. This is my absolute bottom line, and I'm not willing to go lower. If you're serious about making this deal happen, this is your last chance. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 12900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last counteroffer before I consider selling to John.
* **Highlighting the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and its potential benefit to him.
* **Sense of urgency:**  This message creates a sense of urgency and a deadline for Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between meeting Bob's budget and securing a price that's close to my minimum.  I'm creating a sense of urgency and emphasizing that this is a final opportunity to make a deal. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $12900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to stay within my budget.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,400. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** $12,400 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, there isn't enough time to negotiate further. 
* **John is a Safe Option:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $10,000, which is better than accepting Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John because it ensures I reach my minimum goal and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which might result in a lower price."
