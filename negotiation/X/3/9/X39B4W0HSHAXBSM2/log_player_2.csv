Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves me room to profit, but it also shows my willingness to negotiate with you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is coming down, but we're still above John's price. Let's see if we can push her a bit further before accepting or going with John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
