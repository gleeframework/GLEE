"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves me room to profit, but it also shows my willingness to negotiate with you.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
