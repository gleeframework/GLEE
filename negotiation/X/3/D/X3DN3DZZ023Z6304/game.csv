"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start closer to my range?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we settle on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can do, but $1,400,000 is still a stretch.  Would you consider $1,200,000?  That's a substantial amount and shows I'm serious about buying.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. However, I still need to get as close to the maximum value as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the product's worth to you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
