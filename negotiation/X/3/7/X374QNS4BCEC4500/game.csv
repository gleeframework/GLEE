"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,000,  which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, which is the highest I'm comfortable with. If you're willing to sell at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $8,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500 as a final compromise. This reflects the value of the product to you and ensures I can make a fair profit. If you're serious about buying, let's make this happen.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to sell at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,350 as a final offer. This reflects the value of the product to you, and it's the best I can do. If you're serious about buying, let's finalize this deal.",9350.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,350 is still not acceptable for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is the absolute highest I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to sell at this price, I'll have to go with another option. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,10,
