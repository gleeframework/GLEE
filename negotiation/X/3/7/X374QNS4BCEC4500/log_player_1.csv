"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob, making the offer seem more appealing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price.
* **Maintain a reasonable margin:** $10,500 is still above my minimum desired price of $15,000 and leaves room for potential further negotiation.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I want to keep the conversation friendly and maintain a positive atmosphere to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,750 is still well below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm not desperate to sell and want to maximize my profit.
* **Negotiation room:** With 6 rounds left, there's still time to try and push for a higher price.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John for a much higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,000,  which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  $10,000 is still much closer to my desired price of $15,000 than Bob's offer.
* **Focus on finding a compromise:** I want to emphasize that we're both trying to find a solution that works for everyone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, which is the highest I'm comfortable with. If you're willing to sell at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $8,800 is far below my minimum desired price of $15,000, and significantly less than what I could get from John.
* **Negotiation room:**  I have 4 rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob.
* **John's offer is the fallback:** If I can't reach a better deal with Bob, selling to John for $15,000 is still a very profitable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but $8,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500 as a final compromise. This reflects the value of the product to you and ensures I can make a fair profit. If you're serious about buying, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but still above my minimum threshold. 
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's worth to Bob to make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Urgency:** The ""final compromise"" language adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Stronger position:**  This price is closer to my desired price than Bob's offer, and with only 3 rounds left, the pressure is on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to sell at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,200 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation room:** With only 2 rounds left, there's still time to push for a slightly higher price. 
* **John's offer is a strong backup:** I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a low price.

I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,350 as a final offer. This reflects the value of the product to you, and it's the best I can do. If you're serious about buying, let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last offer, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.
* **Slight compromise:** I'm making a small concession, demonstrating willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining value:** $9,350 is still significantly above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Focus on closure:** I'm emphasizing the importance of finalizing the deal to encourage Bob to accept.

With only one round remaining, I need to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing my profit. This final offer leaves room for a possible counteroffer from Bob, but it's also close enough to my desired price that it's worth the risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,350 is still not acceptable for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is the absolute highest I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to sell at this price, I'll have to go with another option. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **No room for further negotiation:** This is Bob's final offer, and I'm not willing to risk losing a sale to John by continuing to negotiate.
* **John's offer is the best option:**  Selling to John guarantees me a much higher profit than accepting Bob's final offer.

I've exhausted all reasonable negotiation options with Bob.  It's time to secure the best possible outcome and sell to John."
