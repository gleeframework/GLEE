"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than $12,000, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay under $9,000. Would you be willing to come down to $9,200? I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $9,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John for $12,000. While there's always the potential to negotiate further, accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially breaking down."
