Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $175. This is a bit above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm hoping to leave some room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with $150, I'm not going to give in so quickly. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to counter with $165. This is still a decent price for Bob and is closer to my target price of $175. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is being stubborn and won't budge from his offer. I've already made two counteroffers, and I'm not willing to go lower.  It's better to sell the product to John for $150 than continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting nothing."
