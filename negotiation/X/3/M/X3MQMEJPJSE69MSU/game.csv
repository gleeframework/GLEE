"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? It's still a fair price for a product worth $100 to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $85 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $90? I think this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $90 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to pay $87 for the product.",87.0,Bob,6,
