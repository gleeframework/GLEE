"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $7,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?  I think that's a fair price.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,750. I'm willing to offer $6,900, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",6900.0,Alice,5,
