"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is already a good deal, but there's no harm in seeing if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $7,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?  I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. I'll try one more time to see if I can get a slightly better deal before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $6,750?"",
""product_price"": 6750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,750. I'm willing to offer $6,900, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and $6,900 is a good price. It's not worth the risk of her raising the price again or the negotiation failing."
