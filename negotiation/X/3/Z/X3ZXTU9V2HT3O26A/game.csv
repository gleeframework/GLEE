"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a reasonable profit for me. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
