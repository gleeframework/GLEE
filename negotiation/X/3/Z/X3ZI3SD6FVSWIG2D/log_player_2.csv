"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $8000 is a good price for you, but I need to make sure I can make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still hoping to get the price closer to his target of $8,000, and Alice's counteroffer is only $500 lower than her initial offer.  He can try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really committed to getting this product, so how about we split the difference and go with $8500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8750. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he's still a little above his target of $8,000,  Alice has come down significantly, and this is a good deal for Bob compared to the $12,000 price from John.  There's a good chance Bob could negotiate further, but accepting at this point is a smart move to avoid risking a breakdown in the negotiation."
