"Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a great starting point. I'm really interested in the product but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $8000 is a good price for you, but I need to make sure I can make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really committed to getting this product, so how about we split the difference and go with $8500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8750. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",8750.0,Alice,5,
