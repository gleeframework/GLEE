"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is at the maximum he's willing to pay.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to negotiate and accept $115 for the product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob can save $5 by accepting Alice's offer. While he could continue to try and negotiate a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John or reaching the end of the negotiation rounds with no deal makes accepting Alice's offer the most sensible choice."
