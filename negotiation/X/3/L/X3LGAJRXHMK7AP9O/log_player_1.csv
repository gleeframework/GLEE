Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, giving him some room to negotiate. It's also significantly lower than my minimum price of $150, leaving me room to drop the price if necessary.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also inviting Bob to respond, showing that I'm open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to balance maximizing my profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By starting with a relatively high price, I aim to secure a good price while still giving Bob an incentive to counter-offer. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to lower the price gradually in subsequent rounds of negotiation, always keeping in mind John's offer as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum price of $150 and doesn't come close to what I believe the product is worth.  

**Strategy:**

While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that severely undervalues my product. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions.  I'll keep in mind John's offer of $150 as my fallback option, ensuring I don't end up selling for less than what I consider fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $100? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with $100, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer of $130. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and open to further negotiation. I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, highlighting the value Bob would get at this price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our current positions. By dropping the price by $30, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate but also ensuring I don't drop below my minimum acceptable price. This strategy is a balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation, knowing that I can still sell to John for $150 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $100 is closer but still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $75? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer of $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, especially considering I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to find a price that is more acceptable to me. However, I'll keep in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John, ensuring I don't end up with a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my offer to $90, which is a significant drop from my previous offer of $100 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $75. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a price that is closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but emphasizing the value of the product.  I'm framing the offer as a compromise and suggesting a ""meet halfway"" approach to encourage a deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price. By reducing my offer by $10, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate further while still keeping in mind the guaranteed sale to John for $150."
