"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $100? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $100 is closer but still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway and see if we can make this work.",90.0,Alice,5,
