Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential returns it can bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  We want to get as close to that as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Safety Net:** We have John as a backup buyer at $800,000, so we don't need to go below that.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a significant profit for you (Alice). 

This strategy aims for a high initial offer, maximizing potential profit while still being reasonable enough for Bob to accept."
