"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $800000.  This represents a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
