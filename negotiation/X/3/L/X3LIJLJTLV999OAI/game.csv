"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. I'm confident it's a fair price considering its potential, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, considering my current financial situation and the potential value I see in the product.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your interest. However, $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still allows for a good profit margin for me while being more within your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the unique value of the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1200000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit out of reach.  I'm confident I can get a good deal with John for $800000, but I'm still interested in your product.  I'm willing to go up to $900000 if you're open to it. This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,4,
