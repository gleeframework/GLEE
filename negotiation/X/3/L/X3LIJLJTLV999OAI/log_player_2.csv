Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your interest. However, $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still allows for a good profit margin for me while being more within your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the unique value of the product. What are your thoughts?
