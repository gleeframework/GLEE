"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $140 is a bit too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to bring the final price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price ($120) while staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is significantly below my minimum selling price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is my final offer. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is firm on her price, and $125 is a good deal for me. It's closer to her value, ensuring a fair deal, and it saves me money compared to buying from John."
