I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but I believe it gives me room to negotiate while still achieving a profitable sale.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet. I think I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's current offer. I hope this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price,  $7,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale at $8,000, and I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  I'm going to sell to John."
