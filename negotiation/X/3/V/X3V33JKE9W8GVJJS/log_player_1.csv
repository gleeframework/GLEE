Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start negotiations significantly higher. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering it at $2,250,000 (150% of Bob's perceived value) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value and justify the high asking price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. We expect Bob to negotiate.  How we respond to his counter-offers will determine the final selling price."
