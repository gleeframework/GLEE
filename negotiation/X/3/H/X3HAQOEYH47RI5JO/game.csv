"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given the value it holds for your business. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This would still be a very attractive price for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
