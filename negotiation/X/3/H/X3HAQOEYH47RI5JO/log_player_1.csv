Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a little higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This would still be a very attractive price for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with the gap. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant amount above my minimum, and we're running out of rounds.  Accepting his offer seems like the best strategy at this point."
