Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so you can be firmer in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always come down in price, but you can't go back up!"
