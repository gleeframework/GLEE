"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($1,100,000) anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves space for potential counteroffers and adjustments while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is framed positively to encourage a collaborative negotiation rather than an adversarial one. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving options open for reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's still considerably lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 and my initial offer.  There's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects my understanding of its worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $50,000, showing flexibility but not drastically.
* **Reaffirming Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Aiming for Midpoint:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still targeting a strong profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $950,000 is the highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $950,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding my minimum by $150,000. 
* **""Highest I Can Go"":** Bob's language suggests this is likely his final offer. Pushing further risks losing the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate returns rather than risking further negotiation rounds for a potentially marginal gain."
