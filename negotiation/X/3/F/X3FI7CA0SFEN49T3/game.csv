"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be happy to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150 for the product? I'm really interested in purchasing it, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",150.0,Bob,4,
