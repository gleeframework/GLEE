"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but I believe the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of what this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this.  $1,275,000 is my final offer. This price reflects a fair deal given the product's potential.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
