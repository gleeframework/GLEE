Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I propose we aim for a more reasonable price closer to $950,000. I hope this suggestion is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the product's value, I must stay within my budget. I propose a price of $1,075,000. I hope this is a step towards reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing willingness to negotiate. We're getting closer to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, but there's still room for Bob to improve his offer significantly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,110,000. This is my final offer, as it's crucial for me to receive a fair price for this unique product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,085,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. Accepting $1,085,000 is a solid profit above the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, and it avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
