Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth this much to me, and I believe this offer gives Bob a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter, but I'll also be keeping John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer. I'm not in a rush and want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer, showing flexibility. However, I'm still aiming for a price above Bob's initial counteroffer, demonstrating my confidence in the product's value. I'm hoping this will lead to a quick agreement, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price and it's within a range I'm comfortable with. It's important to recognize that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, and I risk losing a valuable buyer.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
