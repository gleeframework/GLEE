"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit over my budget.  How about we settle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $760,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $820,000, which is the lowest I can go.",820000.0,Alice,5,
