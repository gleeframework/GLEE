Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to my desired price, but $1,100,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating in hopes of getting a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This is a final offer from my side, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is close to my last offer of $1,050,000.  Considering I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, accepting Alice's offer saves me $125,000.  It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept it."
