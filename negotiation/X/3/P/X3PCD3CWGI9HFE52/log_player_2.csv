Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $75. How about we try $80, which is my minimum, and we can call it a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Alice has reached her minimum price, and it's a reasonable deal for you. There's no guarantee you can get a lower price, and continuing to negotiate might irritate Alice.  Accepting now secures the product at a good price."
