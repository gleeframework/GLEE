Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, $100.  While it's unlikely Bob will accept this, it sets the starting point for negotiation and shows that I'm firm about my value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum value of $100. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a compromise at $90. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it's still closer to my value than Bob's offer."
