"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price.  $95 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",105.0,Alice,3,
