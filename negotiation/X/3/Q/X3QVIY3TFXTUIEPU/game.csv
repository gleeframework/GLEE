"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could we work something out closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your position, the $1,100,000 price point doesn't accurately reflect the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,210,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's value.  What do you say?",1210000.0,Alice,5,
