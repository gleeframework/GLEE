"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Given the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I've reviewed your latest offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go without compromising my financial situation. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
