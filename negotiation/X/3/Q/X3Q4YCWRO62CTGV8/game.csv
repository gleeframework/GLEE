"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business. I've assessed its worth and believe a price of $1,200,000 would be fair for both of us. This price allows for a significant profit for you while still ensuring a substantial return on my investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This allows for a substantial profit for you and ensures a fair return for me. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be frank, I have a budget I need to stick to, so $950,000 would be the sweet spot for me.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment. Would you consider $1,000,000? This price still allows for a significant profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair price for the value I'm offering.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
