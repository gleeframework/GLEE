Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business. I've assessed its worth and believe a price of $1,200,000 would be fair for both of us. This price allows for a significant profit for you while still ensuring a substantial return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I have 9 rounds left and want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This allows for a substantial profit for you and ensures a fair return for me. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be frank, I have a budget I need to stick to, so $950,000 would be the sweet spot for me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I have 6 rounds left and I'd like to try and get closer to my desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment. Would you consider $1,000,000? This price still allows for a significant profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair price for the value I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
