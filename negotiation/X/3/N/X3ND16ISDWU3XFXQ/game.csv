"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  This allows for a significant profit margin for you, while still ensuring a very favorable outcome for me. Please let me know your decision.  If you decline, I have another buyer waiting in the wings.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
