"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I have to think about the value of the product and the potential returns it could bring. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you're placing on it, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $775000 is a significant compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. However, I still need to consider the value I've placed on it. I'm willing to make a slightly smaller concession and offer it to you for $795000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but $795000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $785000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it, and I'm willing to commit to purchasing it at this price.",785000.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not sure if I'm willing to pay $790000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $785000 and $790000, which would be $787500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product, and I'm willing to commit to purchasing it at this price.",787500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $795000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $792000. I'm willing to pay $790000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",790000.0,Bob,10,
