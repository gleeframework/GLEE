"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming for a higher profit margin.  I'm hoping to get a counteroffer from Bob and negotiate from there.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm hoping to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $15,500. This is above my minimum threshold of $15,000 and represents a good compromise. While I could try to get a slightly higher price, there's always the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and me having to settle with John for $15,000.  This feels like a good balance of risk and reward."
