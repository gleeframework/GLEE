"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $162.50. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",162.5,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $155?",155.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, $155 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",160.0,Alice,5,
