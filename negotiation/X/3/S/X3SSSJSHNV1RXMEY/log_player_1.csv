{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for a potential compromise. It also emphasizes the value of the product, making it more likely that Bob will consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $100 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great value for you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
