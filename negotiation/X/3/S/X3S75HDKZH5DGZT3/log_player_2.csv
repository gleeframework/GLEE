"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1000000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer. If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for a higher price, but I'd rather sell it to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000, which is too high. I'd rather buy it from John for $800,000.
