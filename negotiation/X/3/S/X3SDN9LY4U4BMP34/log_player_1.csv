Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a friendly tone and expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is your minimum, you can likely get more. It's worth exploring if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $120.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has dropped his offer below your minimum. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's likely he won't budge further. Selling to John for $100 ensures you meet your minimum and avoid further potential losses."
