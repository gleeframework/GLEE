"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to let it go for $750000. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $875000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to propose $825000 as a compromise. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable gap between our values.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'll need to get closer to my original asking price. How about we try $900000?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your effort in trying to reach an agreement, Alice. However, I am unable to meet you at $900000. Let's try $875000 as a final attempt before considering an alternative seller.",875000.0,Bob,6,
