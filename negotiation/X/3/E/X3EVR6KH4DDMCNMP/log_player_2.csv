"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so he starts with a counteroffer that is $50,000 above that price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still better than buying from John, Bob can still try to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially getting closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his last offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows he is willing to compromise and get closer to Alice's price, but is still trying to save money. This counteroffer gives Alice some incentive to accept, as she is closer to her target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $50,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but the risk is that Alice might reject any further counteroffers and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point, as it secures a price within Bob's budget and is still better than buying from John."
