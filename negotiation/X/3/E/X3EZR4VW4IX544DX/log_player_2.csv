"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $10500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's slightly above my minimum asking price and well below what it's worth to you. Let me know if you'd like to proceed! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
