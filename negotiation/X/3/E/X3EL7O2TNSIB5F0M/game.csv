"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? That would be a win-win for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $800,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're tough! I respect that.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it: $787,500.  It's a strong offer, and I think it's time we close this deal.",787500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're making a strong offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $806,250.
