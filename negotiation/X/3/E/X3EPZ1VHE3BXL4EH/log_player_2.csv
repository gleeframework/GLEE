# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have a clear goal of saving as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price point of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your proposal, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  Starting at your absolute maximum price point shows Alice you're serious about getting a deal but also sets a clear limit.

* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends on a positive note, indicating you're open to further discussion."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counterproposal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise for me. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Please consider this seriously, as we're getting closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```
