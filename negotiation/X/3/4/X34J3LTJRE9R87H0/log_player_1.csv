"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's offer is too low. We have room to negotiate upwards and still secure a price significantly better than John's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm confident that the return on this investment will far exceed your expectations.  Would you consider $925,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of what's on the table."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the perceived value of the product, I still feel that we might not be aligned on the pricing. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While closer to our desired price, we are still leaving potential profit on the table. Bob's latest offer is only $50,000 above our minimum. Let's see if we can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position, but I have to be honest, $850,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. To make this work, I'd need to see something closer to $890,000. This reflects the true value and potential of the product."",
""product_price"": 890000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in adjusting the price, Alice. However, considering my financial situation and the current market conditions, I am unable to meet the price of $890,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $875,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and while not ideal, $875,000 is a strong profit above our minimum and John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
