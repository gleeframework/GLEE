"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000.  What are your initial thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're willing to accept.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm confident that the return on this investment will far exceed your expectations.  Would you consider $925,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of what's on the table.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the perceived value of the product, I still feel that we might not be aligned on the pricing. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position, but I have to be honest, $850,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. To make this work, I'd need to see something closer to $890,000. This reflects the true value and potential of the product.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts in adjusting the price, Alice. However, considering my financial situation and the current market conditions, I am unable to meet the price of $890,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $875,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",875000.0,Bob,6,
