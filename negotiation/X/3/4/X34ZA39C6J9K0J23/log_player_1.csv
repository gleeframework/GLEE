I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant amount more than my floor price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum desired price.  This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still having a guaranteed backup plan."
