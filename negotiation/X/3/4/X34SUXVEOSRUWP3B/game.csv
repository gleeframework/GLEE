"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
