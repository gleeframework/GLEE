"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1100000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850000, which is a significant amount, and hopefully a good starting point for us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $950000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $900000.  This is a fair price that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975000. This is a good compromise that should work for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $975000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll offer $925000.  This is a fair compromise and a strong final offer from me.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975000 is still too high, I'll meet you at $950000, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Alice,7,
