"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is more in line with the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to continue negotiating.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you consider $975,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value and my financial limitations.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
