"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer for the product is $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way above his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Let's meet in the middle at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He can try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $13,500? It's a good compromise and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While he's getting closer to his budget, $14,000 is still above his ideal price. He can try to negotiate further to see if Alice will budge. It's risky, but he has time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $13,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000, which is $13,500. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer. Alice has come down to $13,500 which is still slightly higher than his ideal price, but close enough for him to consider. The deal is close, and he should take it before the price goes up again or he runs out of rounds.  If he rejects, he might get a better deal, but there's also a chance that Alice will become more firm on the price.  Also, he's only got 3 rounds left before he has to buy from John."
