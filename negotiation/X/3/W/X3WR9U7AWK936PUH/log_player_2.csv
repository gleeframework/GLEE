"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $12,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is stuck on $12,000, but we've made it clear we're aiming for $10,000. We need to show we're serious about the lower price without going too low and risking her walking away.  It's still early in the negotiation, so we have time to nudge her down."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I need a price that works for me. To show I'm willing to compromise, I'll offer $10,500. That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're being firm by stating our final offer, showing Alice we're serious about the lower price. 
* **Small Concession:** By increasing our offer slightly to $10,500, we're showing a willingness to compromise and meet her halfway from her last offer of $12,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning it's our final offer creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your seriousness, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** Alice seems fixed on a price above $11,000. We need to demonstrate that we're willing to walk away if she doesn't budge further.
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have a few rounds left. Continuing to counter with small increments might not be the most effective use of the remaining time. 
* **John's Price:** While $15,000 from John is not ideal, it's important to keep it in mind as a fallback option as we approach the later rounds."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but so do I. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but that's really the best I can do. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to seriously consider my other options."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  We're down to the wire.  This counter-offer is a final nudge towards a price we can accept. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning other options, we're subtly reminding Alice that we're willing to walk away from the negotiation.
* **Minimal Concession:** The $250 increase from our previous offer shows we're still willing to negotiate, but only slightly.  This keeps us close to our target while applying a bit more pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has made it clear she won't budge below $11,250. We've been equally firm about our price ceiling. 
* **Final Round:** This is the penultimate round. Even if we counter-offer in Round 10, it's unlikely Alice will drop her price significantly enough to make it worthwhile for us.
* **John's Guarantee:** While buying from John is more expensive ($15,000), it guarantees we get the product.  Continuing with Alice for one more round has a high risk of ending in no deal at all. 

At this point, it's wiser to secure the product at a price we know is available, rather than risk walking away with nothing after investing so much time in negotiation."
