"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still early in the negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  There's no need to rush into a decision, especially since Bob has the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10000, but I'm not comfortable going that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate. There are still many rounds left, and he can likely get a price closer to his target of $10,000.  Plus, he still has the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like. How about we meet at $10,500?  That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $10500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $11500. How about we meet at $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, Bob can still push for a lower price. He's only had 5 rounds, and there's still room to negotiate.  Since he has the option to buy from John for $15,000, he doesn't need to settle immediately.  He can likely get a better deal if he continues to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,750?  That's a fair compromise considering we're both getting closer to our target prices."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11000. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about we meet at $10875? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected a few offers from Alice, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to go much lower than $10,875.  This price is within Bob's budget, and he's already nearing his target price of $10,000.  It's more likely that Alice will reject any further counter-offers. 

Accepting this offer ensures that Bob gets the product at a good price without risking losing the deal by being too aggressive."
