"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves some room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is more than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this shows flexibility and encourages him to come up a bit more."
