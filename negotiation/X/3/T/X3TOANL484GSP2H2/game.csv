"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $110 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $120 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $115. Can we discuss further?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $120. Let's be reasonable here - we're both getting closer to a deal, and $120 is a fair price for both of us. ",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $120, but I'm willing to meet you at $112. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price",112.0,Bob,6,
