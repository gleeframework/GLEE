"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. It's a substantial investment, but I'm confident the potential returns will justify it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. While I'm interested in the product,  $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is my absolute minimum,  I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm confident this product will deliver significant value, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. It's a price that reflects the value of this opportunity, but also gives you room to profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $950000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm ready to commit at $900000, which reflects the value I see in this product and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
