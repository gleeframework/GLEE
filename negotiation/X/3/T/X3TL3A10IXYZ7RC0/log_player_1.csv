Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. While I'm interested in the product,  $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm not thrilled with his initial offer, I'm confident I can get a higher price if I continue negotiating.  $800,000 is my absolute minimum, but I believe I can do better."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is my absolute minimum,  I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm confident this product will deliver significant value, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. It's a price that reflects the value of this opportunity, but also gives you room to profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $950000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm ready to commit at $900000, which reflects the value I see in this product and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a little more, $900,000 is a good price, and it seems like Bob is committed to buying the product.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer."
