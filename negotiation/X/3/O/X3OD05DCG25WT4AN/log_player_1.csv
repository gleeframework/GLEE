"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable to you, but $120 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $90 is a reasonable outcome. It surpasses Bob's initial offer and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or losing him as a buyer."
