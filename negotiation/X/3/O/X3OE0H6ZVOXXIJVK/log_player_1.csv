"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit your business. I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I start significantly higher ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and negotiating style. His counter-offer will reveal how much he truly values the product and how flexible he's willing to be.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware of John's offer ($1,500,000), which serves as a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, given its potential value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to negotiate a price closer to my target.  I'm not ready to accept his offer or go to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the premium value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and recognizes the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a substantial concession from my initial price to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Above Minimum:**  Importantly, I remain well above my absolute minimum ($1,500,000) and closer to my initial ask.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value and benefits, I aim to justify the higher price point and keep the negotiation anchored in a favorable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair given the product's potential value and my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting close, and there's a risk Bob could walk away or lower his offer.  Accepting now secures a significant profit."
