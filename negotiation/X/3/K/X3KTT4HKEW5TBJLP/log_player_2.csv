# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you.  I'm offering it at $1,100,000. This offer stands for 48 hours, after which I will be moving forward with another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is tempting, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a significantly lower price."
