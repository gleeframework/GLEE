"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $900,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  The product is only worth $800,000 to Alice, leaving room for a lower price that still benefits both parties."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility.  While it's a good starting point, I'm aiming to get a bit closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This still leaves a good profit margin for you and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim for a price closer to $850,000, as it leaves a good profit margin for Alice while still saving Bob a significant amount of money."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, I'm still a bit above my target price.  How about we settle on $875,000? This is a fair compromise,  leaving you a decent profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your target price, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own needs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her original offer of $900,000. While Bob might be able to squeeze a bit more out of her, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for a much higher price is significant. Accepting the offer is the most practical choice, allowing Bob to save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
