"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and negotiating is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I really need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to pay $11,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, it's still above Bob's budget and what he's willing to pay.  He's better off continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower price.  He can also always opt to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product.  This would give you a decent profit, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal.  While $10,500 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and he's not ready to settle yet. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his target price of $8,000. He can also always buy from John if the deal with Alice falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a good price for both of us.  I hope you can agree to this, as I'm very interested in buying it from you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $10,800? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still higher than he's willing to pay.  With only a few rounds left, it's unlikely that Alice will come down further.  Bob is better off buying the product from John at $8,000 and saving the time and effort of further negotiation.  He's already secured a great deal, and it's not worth risking further negotiation for a small potential price reduction."
