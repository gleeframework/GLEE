"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I really need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to pay $11,000 for the product?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product.  This would give you a decent profit, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's try to close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a good price for both of us.  I hope you can agree to this, as I'm very interested in buying it from you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $10,800? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",10800.0,Alice,7,
