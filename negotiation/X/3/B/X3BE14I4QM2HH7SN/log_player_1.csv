"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and slightly below my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique features"" and ""true worth"" aims to justify the high initial price and potentially shift Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:**  While I have the John offer as a backup, it's too early to reveal it. I'll aim to negotiate with Bob for the best possible price before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). Accepting would mean a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Bob's low offer suggests he's aiming for a very favorable deal. Rejecting it signals that I'm serious about the product's value and won't settle for a low price. 
* **John as Leverage:** While I'm not selling to John yet, knowing I have a guaranteed offer helps me negotiate with more confidence. 
 

I will counter with a price closer to my acceptable range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds that figure, making your offer unfeasible. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $950,000. This reflects a substantial adjustment on my part while still recognizing the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** My counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial price but remains above Bob's perceived value and closer to my minimum.
* **Justification:** By stating the product ""significantly exceeds"" Bob's offer, I reiterate its high value while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Pressure Point:** This counteroffer puts a bit more pressure on Bob. He's now aware I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm to a price above his initial perception. 
* **Time Consideration:**  With each round, the risk of Bob walking away increases. This offer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still striving for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $950,000 is still more than I had budgeted for this purchase. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving upward, but his offer of $725,000 is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum.  The pace of the negotiation suggests it might be difficult to bridge the gap quickly.
* **John Option as Leverage:** Knowing I have John's offer makes me less inclined to accept a low offer from Bob, especially when we are still far apart. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 7 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate at this pace might not be the most efficient use of time if Bob is unwilling to make substantial jumps in his offers. 

I will reject Bob's offer, but in my next counteroffer, I will clearly signal that my patience is limited and I'm considering other options if we don't reach a more agreeable price soon."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart on price. I've received a very strong offer from another interested party, and while I'd prefer to do business with you, I need to be realistic about my options. My final offer is $875,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I need a decision from you this round to move forward."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** This counteroffer sets a firm tone and signals that my willingness to negotiate further is limited. 
* **Introducing Urgency:** By mentioning the ""other interested party"" (John) and making this my ""final offer,"" I'm introducing urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Time Pressure:** Limiting Bob to making a decision ""this round"" puts the pressure on him to respond quickly and seriously consider the offer.
* **Strategic Compromise:** While $875,000 is a compromise, it's still a price point significantly above Bob's initial offer and provides a reasonable profit margin.

This approach aims to either secure a favorable deal quickly or allow me to move on to John's offer without wasting further rounds."
