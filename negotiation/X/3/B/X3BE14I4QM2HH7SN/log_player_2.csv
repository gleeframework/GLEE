Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds that figure, making your offer unfeasible. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $950,000. This reflects a substantial adjustment on my part while still recognizing the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart on price. I've received a very strong offer from another interested party, and while I'd prefer to do business with you, I need to be realistic about my options. My final offer is $875,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I need a decision from you this round to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and implying she has another buyer.  While her price is getting closer to your limit, it's still a significant difference from John's offer. At this point, the risk of further negotiation isn't worth the potential savings. John provides a guaranteed price that meets your needs."
