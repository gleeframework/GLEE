"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, the price you're asking is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value is significant, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. To be frank, I'm working with a maximum budget of $800,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
