"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is interesting, but $18,000 is too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good deal for you. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000, but I'm not going any lower than that.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a fair compromise for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15,500 is still too close to your original asking price.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500, which is a fair compromise considering we've both made concessions.  Let's get this done.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, which is my minimum price, but I'm willing to make a deal with you at this point.",15000.0,Alice,7,
