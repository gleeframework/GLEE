,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still fair considering the value the product provides. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll need to explore other options.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. If we can meet in the middle here, I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
