"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $15,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $17,500. This is a significant markup, and there are only 10 rounds to negotiate. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still fair considering the value the product provides. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to your desired price, you're still above your target of $15,000.  There are still rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and continuing the conversation is the best option. You may be able to secure a better deal by pushing further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. If we can meet in the middle here, I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
