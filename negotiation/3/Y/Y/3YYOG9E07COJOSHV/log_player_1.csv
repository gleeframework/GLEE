Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $10,000 is above your $8,000 floor, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:**  By offering $10,000, you're leaving some potential profit for Bob, making him more likely to accept. 
* **It sets the tone for a negotiation:** You're starting by showing you're willing to negotiate, but also that you're confident in the value of your product. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response and the potential of selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, accepting his offer guarantees you a sale at a reasonable price.  It's also a good strategy to avoid risking further negotiation with Bob, as he might be unwilling to go higher."
