"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which holds significant value for you at $15,000. I understand its importance to you and would like to offer it at a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. I propose to sell the product to you for $12,000. This offer not only provides you with an opportunity to acquire something of immense value at a discounted rate but also ensures a profitable sale for me. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product for more than its value to her ($8,000). Her offer of $12,000 gives her a good profit margin.
* **Your Limit:** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but it's always better to pay less.
* **Negotiation Power:** You have John as a backup option at $15,000. This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. There's a chance she might come back with a lower offer closer to your desired range."
