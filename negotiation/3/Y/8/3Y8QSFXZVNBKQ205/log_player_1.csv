Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob is unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my desired price point, I believe I can get closer to $100 with a counteroffer. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident that I can find a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, I'll be happy with the price. If he rejects, I can consider selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $92.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and possibly end up selling to John for $80."
