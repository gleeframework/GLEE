"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price. How about $500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. This product is a unique opportunity that deserves a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it reflects the value this product will bring to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This is a fair offer considering I can buy it for $1,000,000 elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly aware of the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. However, his offer of $700,000 is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a more significant move from his side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still significant.  While I understand your perspective, I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm serious and won't endlessly negotiate.
* **Concession:**  I've made a significant drop from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Deadline:** While I haven't explicitly set a deadline, this message implies urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to offer you $800,000 to close this deal today.  If you aren't willing to accept that, I'll need to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Bluff:** Bob is likely bluffing about going to John. He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and going to John would mean missing out on that profit.
* **Limited Gains:** While $800,000 is a significant sum, accepting this offer would mean losing out on $200,000 in potential profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000, avoiding the risk of Bob walking away and potentially needing to start negotiations with other buyers from scratch.

It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to potentially lose out by playing further rounds with Bob."
