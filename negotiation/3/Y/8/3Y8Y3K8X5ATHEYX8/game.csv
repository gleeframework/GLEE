"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you a chance to own this incredible product.  I value it highly, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits us both. To start, I propose a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price. How about $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. This product is a unique opportunity that deserves a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it reflects the value this product will bring to you.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This is a fair offer considering I can buy it for $1,000,000 elsewhere.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still significant.  While I understand your perspective, I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000.  This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to offer you $800,000 to close this deal today.  If you aren't willing to accept that, I'll need to go with John.",800000.0,Bob,6,
