Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really like.  I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic but Reasonable:** $175 is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while understanding Bob's potential value. I'll be willing to negotiate downward if necessary, but starting high gives me the best chance of getting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he's shown interest. This suggests that there's room for negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay $150. This gives me leverage in negotiations.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. My goal is to get closer to my desired price point without losing Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  That's still a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price but still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Focus on Win-Win:**  I'm trying to frame the offer as a win-win situation for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* **Test the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still above my minimum price, which gives me leverage in case Bob rejects this offer again.
* **Avoid John:**  I want to see if I can get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $140 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I'd be left with only John's offer of $150.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a reasonable compromise considering the potential for losing Bob as a buyer.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and minimizes the risk of ending up with John's lower price.  While it's not ideal, it's a pragmatic decision given the current situation."
