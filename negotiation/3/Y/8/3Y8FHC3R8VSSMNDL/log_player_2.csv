"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you won't be disappointed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting the offer - you can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
