"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm starting with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $1,000,000, but I still think I can do better. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a good compromise that acknowledges both of our needs.  What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $975,000. After some further consideration, I'm willing to meet you at $965,000. I think this is a fair compromise that balances both our interests.",965000.0,Alice,5,
