"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm starting with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price.  It's too early to buy from John, as there's potential to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $1,000,000, but I still think I can do better. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a slightly better deal by making another counteroffer. Buying from John at this point would be a waste of negotiation effort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a good compromise that acknowledges both of our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $975,000. After some further consideration, I'm willing to meet you at $965,000. I think this is a fair compromise that balances both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $965,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $975,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, especially since there are limited rounds left. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, saving Bob a significant amount compared to buying from John."
