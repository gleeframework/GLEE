"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above $1,000,000.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than I'd like, but it's the best I've gotten so far.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,050,000."
