Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, I've already had 5 rounds of negotiation. Time is running out and I don't want to risk further negotiation and ending up with a lower price.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is the minimum I am willing to accept. I will sell to John."
