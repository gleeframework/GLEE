{""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $800,000, I'm offering the lowest possible price I'm willing to pay. This is a strong opening counteroffer that shows my commitment to a deal while making it clear I won't overpay."

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better price closer to my target.  I'm confident I can push for a better deal with further counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial counteroffer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's within my budget.  This counteroffer is a fair compromise that might be more appealing to Alice than her previous offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point.  I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can secure a better deal with another counteroffer. The negotiation process seems to be moving in the right direction, and I believe I can push for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget. This counteroffer is a fair compromise that could be acceptable to Alice. 

This is a strategic move as it shows Alice that I am serious about purchasing the product while also maintaining a price point that is within my comfort zone. This counteroffer might encourage Alice to make a final concession to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and while it's possible we could continue to negotiate, the risk of getting stuck in a cycle of back and forth is high. It's clear that Alice is not willing to go much lower than $1 million.  Since John offers a price that is within my budget, it's more advantageous to accept his offer and secure the product."
