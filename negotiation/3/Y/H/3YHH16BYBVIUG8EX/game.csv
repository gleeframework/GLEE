"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit more than you initially wanted to pay.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still really interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm at $8,500.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm at $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750.  This is a good deal for both of us and allows us to close this transaction.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,
