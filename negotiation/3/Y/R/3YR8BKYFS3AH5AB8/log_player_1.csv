"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. I think it's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $97.5 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
