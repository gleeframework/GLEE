"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 130} 
 
I'm starting high, hoping to get a good price. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, there's room for negotiation. Let's see if he's willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $125. This is a bit closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $117.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach an agreement before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122.5}
```

I'm going to counteroffer again with $122.5. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate and encourages Bob to come closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $118.5 is closer to my minimum, we're running out of time. I'm going to sell to John for $120.  This guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
