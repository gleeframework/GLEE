{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. It's important to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I think that's a fair compromise between our initial offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 that it's worth accepting.  It's a fair compromise, and I can still make a profit."
