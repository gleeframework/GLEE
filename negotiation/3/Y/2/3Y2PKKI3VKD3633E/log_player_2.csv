It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice.  $95 is still too high, as the product is only worth $100 to you."

While I'd love to get it for less, Alice is only budging a little. At this point, $92 is the best price we've seen, and there's a chance she might not budge further. It's better to secure the deal than risk losing it and ending up paying John $100."
