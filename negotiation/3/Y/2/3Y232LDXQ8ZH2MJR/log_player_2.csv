"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,250,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table.
