"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high opening offer, but it allows for room to negotiate. It's also above my minimum acceptable price, which gives me some wiggle room.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob while also keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer. I'll reject and counter again, hoping to find a price we can both agree on.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize that the value of the product is worth this price. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's not worth risking a lower price, especially with the potential to get my minimum with John.  I'll sell to John to ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with."
