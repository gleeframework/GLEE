Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000, which would be $1,112,500. Would you be open to considering this price?

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it."
