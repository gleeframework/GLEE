"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we split the difference again and settle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. Let's meet in the middle again and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",125.0,Alice,5,
