{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold. I have 6 rounds left and I want to try and get closer to my goal of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll need to seriously consider purchasing from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
