"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this is a great product, $14,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  How about we split the difference and make it $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to make $13,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in between",13000.0,Alice,5,
