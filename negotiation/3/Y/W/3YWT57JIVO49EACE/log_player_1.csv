"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, giving Bob some room to negotiate. I'm also being positive and highlighting the product's value to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, say around $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is significantly below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a more reasonable counter-offer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $80 is way below what I can offer it for. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $80 was a bit low, Alice.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last counter-offer? Would $100 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is exactly what the product is worth to him, and while it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and it's better than selling to John for $150. I'll accept his offer."
