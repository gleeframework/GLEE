"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $110. You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice values the product at $100. This means there's room for negotiation. Reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice is willing to negotiate but is still a bit higher than your target.  Reject the offer and continue to try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want $115, but I'm still trying to stay closer to $105.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, though! How about we try $112.50? It's a small step back from my original ask, but I think it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $112.50, which is within your budget and a decent deal. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely she won't go much lower. Accepting the offer saves you time and effort compared to potentially going back and forth further."
