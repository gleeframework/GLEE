"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $105. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want $115, but I'm still trying to stay closer to $105.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, though! How about we try $112.50? It's a small step back from my original ask, but I think it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think!",112.5,Alice,5,
