Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a high starting offer, reflecting the product's value to me. It also opens a dialogue and allows for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1000000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'd be willing to pay $750000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the potential value of the product. Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that we'll reach a higher price, and I risk losing the deal altogether. It's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
