Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1,262,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, her final offer of $1,262,500 is still more expensive than John's offer of $1,200,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price than John's."
