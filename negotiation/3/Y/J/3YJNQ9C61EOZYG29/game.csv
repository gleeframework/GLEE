"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to that number.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from your target. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $1050000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $975000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it.",975000.0,Bob,4,
