"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $87?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87}
