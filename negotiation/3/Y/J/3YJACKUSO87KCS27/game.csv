"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the unique value of this product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $950000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product and would allow us to close this deal quickly.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise a little.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000. This is a fair price, considering the value of this product and the time we've spent negotiating. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I'm confident this price is acceptable.
