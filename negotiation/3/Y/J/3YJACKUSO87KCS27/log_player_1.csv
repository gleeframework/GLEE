Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price closer to my target.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe there is still potential to get a better price from Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $950000.
