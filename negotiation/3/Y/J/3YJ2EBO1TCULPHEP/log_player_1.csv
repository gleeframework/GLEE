Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great price considering its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've set the price at $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've included a friendly message that highlights the value of the product for Bob while also presenting the price as a ""great deal."" 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that's not too aggressive, I'm hoping to start the negotiation on a positive note. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind, knowing I can always stop the negotiation and sell to him for $8,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's my minimum acceptable price, it's not worth losing out on potential profit.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better price. There's a good chance Bob will come up in his counteroffer, especially since he recognizes the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to make this work. This price is still fair given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $10,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still securing a decent profit.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints and offer a reason for my counteroffer. I remain optimistic about reaching an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a lower price, I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price point. I'm keeping the negotiations moving forward while still maintaining a profitable margin."
