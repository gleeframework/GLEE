"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product worth well over $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price considering it's much closer to my budget. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. That's a significant compromise on my end. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,250 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $10,900. This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at the moment. What do you think?",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,900 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $11,050.  This is a fair compromise and I believe it's the best we can do to close this deal.",11050.0,Alice,7,
