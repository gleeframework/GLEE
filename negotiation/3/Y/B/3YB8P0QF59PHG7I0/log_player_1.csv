Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what I would sell it to John for. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but still ensures I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with this counteroffer. It's still a good profit for me, but also closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than what John would pay.  It's not a huge difference, but it's still a good profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
