Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a good deal. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further, but I'm confident in the value of my product and my ability to get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $8,000. I'm confident I can make a counteroffer that will be more appealing to Bob than selling to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm offering a price that's in the middle ground between Bob's offer and my minimum price.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target, it's better to secure the sale than risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John would be a guaranteed $8,000, but Bob's offer is slightly better, and I don't want to risk a prolonged negotiation that could potentially fail."
