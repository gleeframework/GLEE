"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's a good deal compared to John's price, Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000? This still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's a step in the right direction, Bob is still aiming to save more money.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  With 8 rounds left, there's ample opportunity to continue negotiating. 
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If the negotiation stalls, Bob can still fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer. How about $10,750?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $10,750 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:** While this offer is close to Bob's desired price, there are still 5 rounds left, and Alice might be willing to negotiate further. However, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the negotiation dragging on for too long is high.
* **The offer is a good compromise:**  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a significant amount compared to buying from John and allows Alice to get closer to her desired price.

In this situation, it's best for Bob to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
