Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $120 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to aim higher. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping me well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justify the Price:**  Mentioning ""special price"" and ""value"" aims to frame the offer positively, even though it's above Bob's perceived value. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging I might need to negotiate down to Bob's valuation."
