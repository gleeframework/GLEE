"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,275,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,285,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1285000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.  That's my absolute final offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,275,000, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,275,000 and $1,300,000. I'll offer it to you for $1,287,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll consider selling it to John for $1,500,000.",1287500.0,Alice,7,
