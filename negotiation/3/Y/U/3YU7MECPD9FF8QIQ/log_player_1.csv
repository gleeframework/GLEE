Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer and work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm going to counter-offer at $8,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer and closer to my desired price. I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, his offer is still below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm not willing to drop that low, and further negotiation seems unlikely to get me to a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so I'll take that option."
