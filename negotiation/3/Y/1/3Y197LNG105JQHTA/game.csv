"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you showing me the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'd be happy to pay $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I can do $13500, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a little hesitant at $13500.  How about $12500?  That's a good midpoint between our last offers, and I'm ready to make a decision.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13000, and I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm getting closer to my target, $13000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12750?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12750 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $12900, and I think that's as low as I can go. This is already below my initial offer, and I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",12900.0,Alice,7,
