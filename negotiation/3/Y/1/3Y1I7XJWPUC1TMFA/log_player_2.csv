"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of significant value to you.  I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting this offer, you open the door to a potentially better counter-offer from her, bringing you closer to her $8,000 valuation."
