"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget, and he can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This price is still a good value for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, lowering the price by $200,000 from Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates Bob's seriousness in getting a deal, while also leaving room for potential negotiation.  He's emphasizing the value of the deal for both parties and framing the offer as a win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,200,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget and a good deal for him.  While he could potentially negotiate further, accepting the offer ensures a purchase within his desired range and avoids risking losing the deal by continuing to haggle.  There's a chance that Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying the higher price from John."
