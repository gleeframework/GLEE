"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This price is still a good value for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,200,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
