Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,200,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's going to be a long negotiation to get anywhere near my minimum price. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a fair deal and avoids further haggling."
