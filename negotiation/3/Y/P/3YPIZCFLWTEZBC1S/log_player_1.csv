Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the potential profit. 
* **Testing the waters:** By offering it at $18,000, you gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Value:** While the product is worth $10,000 to both you and Bob, its actual market value is unclear. Researching similar products can inform your pricing strategy.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, a slightly lower starting point might be more effective."
