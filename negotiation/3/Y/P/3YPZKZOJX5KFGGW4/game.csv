"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $10000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down.  $13000 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $10000.  If you can't go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
