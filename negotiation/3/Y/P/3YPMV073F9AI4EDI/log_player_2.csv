"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it offers. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to accept $85? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to sell the product for $90. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit for me. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $90 is a better offer than $95, it's still above Bob's maximum desired price of $85. Rejecting the offer allows Bob another chance to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $87? I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 87}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt reply, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Considering the value of the product and aiming for mutual benefit, I am willing to accept $88 for the product. I believe this price strikes a good balance between fairness and profitability. I look forward to your consideration of this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately needing to buy from John for $100 outweighs the potential savings of a few more dollars. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without further risk."
