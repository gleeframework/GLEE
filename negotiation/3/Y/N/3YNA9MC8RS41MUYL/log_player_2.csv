"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation, and it's unlikely she'll accept a counteroffer as low as I'd like in the first round.  I'll counter-offer next round to try and bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
 ""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($65) aims to shift the negotiation in my favor. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it establishes a lower target price.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help me understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she outright rejects it, I know I might need to increase my offers more incrementally.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping the option of buying from John ($100) in mind as a fallback if negotiations with Alice don't progress favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $85. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice came down from $90 to $85, it's a small concession. It suggests she's aiming for a price closer to her initial offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** We still have seven rounds left. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a price closer to my target.
* **John as Backup:**  The option to buy from John for $100 is still available if negotiations stall or become unreasonable."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price directly in between our last offers ($65 and $85). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will reveal more about Alice's flexibility. If she accepts, it's a good deal. If she counters, it will indicate her acceptable price range.
* **Time Consideration:** We're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation. While I don't want to rush, I need to make progress to avoid getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable selling it for $75. I can do $82.50, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Movement:** Alice's price reduction is very small ($2.50). It suggests she's becoming less flexible and trying to anchor the price close to her previous offer. 
* **Testing Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I'm gauging how firm Alice is on her ""lowest price."" There's a chance she might be bluffing to see if I'll crack. 
* **Time Factor:** We're halfway through the rounds. Continuing to negotiate for a better price still makes sense, but I need to be mindful of the remaining time. I might consider a smaller counter-offer next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're really close. I understand you have a bottom line.  Would you consider $78 â€“ it's a fair price for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller counter-offer this round ($3 increase from my last offer). This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but still want a price closer to my target. 
* **Direct Approach:**  My message is straightforward and acknowledges that Alice is likely close to her limit.  This might encourage her to finalize the deal rather than drag it further.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to increase the pace of negotiation. This offer aims to either secure a reasonable price now or get a clear indication of Alice's absolute lowest price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is my minimum price. If you're really interested in the product, this is the best I can do. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Her Limit:** Alice has explicitly stated that $80 is her minimum price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Good Deal:** While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, $80 is already a good deal, saving me $20 compared to buying from John.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only three rounds left, continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice sticking to her price and me having to settle for John's $100 offer. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
