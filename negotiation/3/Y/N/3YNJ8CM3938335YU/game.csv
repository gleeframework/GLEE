"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is certainly a respectable offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the product's potential for you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
