Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $145 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly above his valuation and close to your minimum. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
