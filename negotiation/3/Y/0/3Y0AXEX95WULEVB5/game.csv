"Hi Alice, $140 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great price for the product, and I think we can reach a deal here.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $117.50.  Let's finalize this deal.",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair. How about we split the difference at $121.25?  It's a little closer to my price, and I think we can finally make this deal work.",121.25,Alice,5,
