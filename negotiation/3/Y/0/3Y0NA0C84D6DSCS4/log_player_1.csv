I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still not at the point where I'm comfortable selling. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for anything lower than $90 right now."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, the time is ticking, and I'm not confident I can get to my desired price point within the remaining rounds.  It's better to guarantee the $100 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
