"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $140 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $130. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
