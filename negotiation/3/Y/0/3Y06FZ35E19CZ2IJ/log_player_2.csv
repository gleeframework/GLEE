Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $130. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $130. To avoid further back and forth and potentially paying more than your limit, it's best to buy from John for $120."
