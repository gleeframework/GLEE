"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $105, which would be $112.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $112.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to try to meet you halfway between $112.50 and my original offer of $90, which would be $101.25. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",101.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $101.25. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112.50 and $101.25, which would be $106.75. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",106.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $106.75 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $106.75 and my original offer of $90, which would be $98.375. I'm not sure if I'm willing to go any lower than that. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",98.375,Bob,6,
