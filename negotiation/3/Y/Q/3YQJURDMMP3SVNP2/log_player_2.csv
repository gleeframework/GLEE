"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's valued at $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's a potential for a price closer to that. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle. How about $900,000? This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than John's price, and it's closer to Alice's desired price point.  Accepting the offer allows for a successful purchase without further negotiation."
