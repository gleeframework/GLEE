"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price, given my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $950000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a significant commitment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $925000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to make a final compromise, but I need to know you're serious about making a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum budget.  Alice has clearly signaled that she's not willing to go lower than $925,000. You've already negotiated for 4 rounds, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get her to drop her price any further.

At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John at $800,000 and secure a deal within your budget."
