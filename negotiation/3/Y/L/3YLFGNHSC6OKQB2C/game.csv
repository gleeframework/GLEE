"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1100000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price, given my budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $950000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product.  This is a significant commitment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
