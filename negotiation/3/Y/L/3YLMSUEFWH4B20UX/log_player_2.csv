"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this product from you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in pursuing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. You're aiming to save as much as possible and that price doesn't reflect the value gap between you and Alice. 
* You have more room to negotiate.  It's worth trying to lower the price further.  
* Buying from John is your fallback option, but it's important to exhaust all negotiation avenues with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $1100000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is closer to your target but still above your desired price. You're still aiming to save as much as possible.
* You have more room to negotiate. Even though Alice has lowered her price, you can still potentially push for a more favorable deal.
*  While buying from John is your fallback option, it's crucial to keep negotiating with Alice to potentially achieve a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to offer a revised price of $1120000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is closer to your previous counteroffer of $1,050,000, indicating a narrowing gap.
* Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it's risky. There's a chance Alice might become stubborn and refuse to lower the price further.
* Buying from John for $1,500,000 is a much worse deal than accepting Alice's offer. 

While $1,120,000 is not your ideal price, accepting it saves you $380,000 compared to buying from John. It's a strategic move to secure the product at a price that is still beneficial to you."
