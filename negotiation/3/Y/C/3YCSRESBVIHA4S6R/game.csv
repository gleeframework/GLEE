"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, so to move this forward, I propose a price of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I think that's a fair offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, $775,000 remains below the minimum I can accept. I'm open to reaching a deal and I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $875,000.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I understand the value you place on the product, and I want to find a number that works for both of us. Would you be willing to agree to $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
