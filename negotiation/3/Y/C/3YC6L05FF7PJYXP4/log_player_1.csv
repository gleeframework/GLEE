Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering it's worth less to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I need to get for the product.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still below what the product is worth to me. This would be a great deal for you, and we can finalize the sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1500000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1250000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to what I need, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, hoping to get a higher price or potentially sell to John if I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $1,250,000 is a fair offer, I need to get closer to $1,500,000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000.  This would be a significant benefit to you, and we can finalize the sale quickly. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $1375000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a very fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's work towards a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, hoping to get a higher price or potentially sell to John if I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.  I have five rounds left, so there's still time to try and get a better offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is a good offer for you, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,350,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting very close.  $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1325000. This is a great compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly. What do you say?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are getting close to a deal with Bob, but with only two rounds left, I'm concerned that I won't be able to get the price up to my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  Instead of risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John and sell the product for $1,500,000.  It's the best outcome for me at this point."
