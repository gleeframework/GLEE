"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a fair price. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and market demand, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
