"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable. My price is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) and higher than Bob's estimated value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to secure a good starting point and leave room for potential counteroffers and negotiation. It also ensures I maintain a comfortable profit margin even if I have to lower the price slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I want to see if I can push for a better deal.
* **Negotiation Power:** By rejecting, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell. This gives me leverage to negotiate further and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a secure option, I believe I have the potential to get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations with Bob.

I'll proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm definitely interested in seeing this product in your hands,  $950,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? I'm sure you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value and highlighting the potential investment return. This reinforces the idea that the price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation. 

By offering a reasonable compromise, I'm aiming to reach a deal that's beneficial to both of us while still ensuring I receive a satisfactory price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,075,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  It's a significant improvement from his previous offer. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or becoming frustrated.  There's also the possibility that I might have to make further concessions.
* **Time Factor:** We're already in round 4, and I'm aware that I only have 10 rounds total. I don't want to risk running out of time.

While I would prefer to get closer to $1,075,000, accepting Bob's offer at $1,025,000 is a good outcome. It's a reasonable price that allows me to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
