Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
