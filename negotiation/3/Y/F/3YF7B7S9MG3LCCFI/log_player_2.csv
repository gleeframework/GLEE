"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. It's a great value considering its worth of $120 to you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  Alice is willing to sell for $100, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to sell the product for $108, which is higher than your offer but still below its perceived value to you. This allows us to reach a fair agreement. Please let me know if this proposal suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $108 is still within your budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $120. You're able to save $12 compared to John's offer. While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice might not budge further.  It's better to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
