"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is significantly lower than I can accept.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
