Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
    *  Lower than your guaranteed sale price ($1,200,000), incentivizing Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counter-offer is too low, you can always walk away knowing you have John as a backup."
