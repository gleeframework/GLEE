"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price.  Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, so there's room to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals that I'm serious about negotiating and I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  This will hopefully push Alice to come down on their price, but I'm prepared to walk away and go to John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down on her price, it's still not a good enough deal for me. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push her lower.  I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm not desperate enough to accept an offer that's still significantly higher than my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and I'm not just trying to get the product for the lowest possible price. I'm also hoping that Alice will see that I'm serious about buying the product and will be more likely to accept a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept the offer. I'm also aware that going through another round of negotiation with Alice might not yield a significantly better result. It's getting closer to my budget limit, and it's risky to keep rejecting offers when I have a fallback option (John) at a much higher price.  This feels like a good compromise."
