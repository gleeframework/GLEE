"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,500,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. He can use the knowledge that John is willing to sell for $1,200,000 as leverage in negotiations with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,380,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account both our interests.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $1,380,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to push for a lower price by making another counteroffer. Bob knows John is willing to sell for $1,200,000, so he has a strong negotiating point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,350,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,370,000. This is a fair price that takes into account our previous discussions and the product's worth.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has reached his maximum budget.  While Alice has come down from her initial price, the offer of $1,370,000 is still above what Bob is willing to pay.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at $1,200,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and gets the product.  Further negotiation with Alice would likely result in a protracted process with no guarantee of a lower price."
