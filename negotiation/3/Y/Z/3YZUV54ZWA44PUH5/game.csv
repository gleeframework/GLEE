"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $155? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference. How about $140?  I'm hoping we can close this deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $147? I think it's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",147.0,Alice,5,
