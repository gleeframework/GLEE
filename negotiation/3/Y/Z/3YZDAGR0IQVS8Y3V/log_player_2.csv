"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $120 to you. Alice is offering it for $100, which is a good deal, but you can likely get it for less.  There's no reason to buy it from John for $120 when you can continue negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $105. Let me know if that works for you!

You have three options:

You're still trying to get the product for less than $100.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can continue negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $97.50. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $108. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is being stubborn.  She's now offering $108, which is higher than your initial target of $100 and getting close to your maximum of $120. At this point, it's best to cut your losses and buy from John for $120. Continuing to negotiate with Alice is likely to result in more back-and-forth and could potentially end up costing you more than $120."
