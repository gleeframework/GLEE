"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is quite close to her perceived value of the product.  While it's tempting to buy it outright for $11,500, there's room for negotiation. You have time and the option of buying from John for a guaranteed $10,000, so it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product is good, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant jump down from Alice's opening offer, but it's still within your acceptable range. By starting low, you're aiming to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A significant counter will reveal how willing she is to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for compromise:** Even if she rejects this offer, there's space to move upwards while still staying below your $10,000 limit.
* **Apply a bit of pressure:** By offering a lower price, you subtly remind Alice that you have other options (John's offer)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10,750. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice met you halfway, but the new offer is still above your ideal price and what John is offering.  There's no rush to accept, and you can likely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You're moving closer to Alice's price, but still maintaining a significant gap to encourage her to come down further.
* **Staying Below John:**  The offer remains below your fallback option, preserving your negotiating power.
* **Projecting Willingness:**  By phrasing it as ""a fair compromise,"" you signal that you're motivated to close the deal but need her to move a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  

Alice has declared this her ""final offer"" and is playing hardball. While $10,500 isn't a terrible price, it's still more than you need to pay.  You have a guaranteed option with John for $10,000, so there's no reason to potentially overpay. It's time to walk away and take the sure thing with John."
