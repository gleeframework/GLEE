"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,500, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $11,250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? It's a fair price for both of us.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I appreciate that. However, $10,875 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,250 and $10,875, which would be $11,062.50. That's my best offer for now. What do you think?",11062.5,Alice,5,
