"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  However, $9,500 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Could we settle somewhere around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I've got another offer for $8,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you have another offer for $8,000, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and my previous offer of $8,200. I'm willing to sell the product for $8,100. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8100.0,Alice,7,
