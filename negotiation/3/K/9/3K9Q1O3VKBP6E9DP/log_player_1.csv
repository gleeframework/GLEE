This is a tough call, as I'm only $2,000 away from my ideal price. However, with only two rounds left, I risk losing the deal entirely and being forced to sell to John for a significantly lower price. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale at a price very close to my target, ensuring a substantial profit."
