"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a high price, but I'm also aware of the potential to close the deal with John if negotiations with Bob fail.  We'll see how he responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident that I can potentially get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can do better. I'm confident I can negotiate further and potentially close a deal for closer to $13,500. I'll continue with the negotiation process to explore this possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm sticking with my strategy of finding a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm not going to give up my desired price range."
