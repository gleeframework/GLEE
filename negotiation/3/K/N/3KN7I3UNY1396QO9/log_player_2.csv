"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,100,000 is still too high for him, and he has the option to negotiate a better price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However,  $900,000 undervalues the product's potential and the unique benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still too high for Bob. He should try to negotiate a lower price, as he has a safety net with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which is a fair price given the value I see and leaves room for you to make a good profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my initial asking price. I believe this price offers a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While Alice is coming down, $1,000,000 is still above Bob's target price.  He's getting close to his own limit, but there's still some room for negotiation before having to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer to an agreement.  I'm willing to go to $975,000 for the product.  I believe this price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I cannot accept less than $990,000 for this product.  It's a final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $990,000 is still above Bob's target price. With only a few rounds remaining, the chance of negotiating a better price is low. At this point, it's wiser for Bob to secure the product from John at his desired price."
