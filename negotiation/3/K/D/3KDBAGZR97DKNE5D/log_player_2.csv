# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000.

{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is far too high for me. While I see the value in this product, my budget is significantly lower. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $700,000.

Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000.

This would be a substantial gain for you and would allow me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To avoid risking further negotiation rounds and potentially missing out on a deal with John, I'm going to buy from John at $800,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price again."
