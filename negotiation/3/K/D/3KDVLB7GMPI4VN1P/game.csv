"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and your budget constraints.  Let's close this deal and get you the product you're looking for.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
