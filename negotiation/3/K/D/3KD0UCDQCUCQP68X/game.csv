"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
