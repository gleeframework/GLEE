Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed backup offer at that price, we want to start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""exceptional value"" and ""true worth,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value above $800,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals that we're open to negotiation and not completely fixed on the $1,200,000.

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a significantly higher price than our fallback option with John."
