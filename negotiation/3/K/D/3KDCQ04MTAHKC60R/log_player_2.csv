"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice's asking price of $1,200,000 is too high.
