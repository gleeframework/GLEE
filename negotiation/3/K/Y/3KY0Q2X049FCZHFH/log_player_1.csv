I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount for Bob, but still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired profit."

I'm offering $110. This is a compromise, giving Bob a bit more of a discount but still leaving me with a comfortable profit. Hopefully, this will be enough to secure the deal."
