Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always beneficial to explore if I can secure a higher profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below that is pointless.
* **Negotiation Room:** By starting at $1,100,000, I leave room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than my guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and favorably.

This strategy aims to balance risk and reward. There's a chance Bob rejects the offer, but there's also potential for a significantly higher profit margin."
