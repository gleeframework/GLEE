"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is just too low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about we compromise at $15,500?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,750 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,250.

Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 15250}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've made a serious offer at $15,000. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough situation!  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm getting the feeling Bob might be bluffing about going to John.  But, with only two rounds left, there's no guarantee we'll reach a better deal.  It's safer to sell to John and guarantee my minimum profit."
