Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm asking $150 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $150 gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **Positive Framing:**  Highlighting the product's value (""fantastic"") increases Bob's interest.
* **Openness:** Asking for his opinion leaves the door open for a conversation and potentially learning more about his perceived value. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer. If the negotiation stalls or I feel Bob is unwilling to meet my price, I'll move on to John and sell for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  $100 is my absolute minimum. I cannot accept Bob's offer at this time. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.  I can use this counteroffer to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to come up. 
* **Exploring Options:** While John offers a guaranteed $100, there's still a chance I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to work with. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** $125 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** ""Great deal"" reinforces the product's worth. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone keeps the conversation open.
* **Room for Flexibility:**  $125 still leaves some space to potentially go lower if necessary, but avoids selling for my minimum right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firm on his $100 offer. Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a higher price.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks wasting time and potentially losing John as a buyer. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. 

While it would be ideal to get more, the situation suggests that Bob is unlikely to budge.  It's more efficient to secure the $100 from John than to continue a potentially fruitless negotiation with Bob."
