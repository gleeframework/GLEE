"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to work with. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
