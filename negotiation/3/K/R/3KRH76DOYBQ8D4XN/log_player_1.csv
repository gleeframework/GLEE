Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

Bob is now quite close to our minimum acceptable price, and further haggling might not yield a significantly better result. It's better to accept the $140 and avoid the risk of losing both buyers."
