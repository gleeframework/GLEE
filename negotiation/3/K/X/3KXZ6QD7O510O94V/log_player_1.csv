{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,250,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's estimated value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and clear, stating the price and highlighting the potential value for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* This price is a strategic move. It allows for potential negotiation while still securing a decent profit for Alice. 
* If Bob rejects, Alice can adjust her counteroffer based on his response, aiming to maximize her earnings.
* Having the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net and leverage during negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). While it's tempting to take the $1,100,000, I need to remember that I have a guaranteed alternative with John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** Selling to Bob for $1,100,000 would result in a substantial loss compared to selling to John.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.
* **Leverage:** Having the option to sell to John gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000,  which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,200,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but below my original asking price.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal while reaffirming my minimum acceptable price. The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while remaining above Bob's current offer.
* **Appeal to fairness:** The message highlights the fairness of the price, emphasizing a win-win situation.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have John as an alternative buyer, which provides leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, $1,150,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for a price that leaves me with a considerable loss.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** Selling to Bob at $1,150,000 would result in a loss compared to selling to John for $1,500,000.
* **Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Leverage:**  I have the guaranteed option of selling to John, which gives me leverage to push for a better offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer, aiming to find a price that is more acceptable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,150,000. However, it's still a bit too far from where I need to be.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this final offer - $1,225,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're open to it."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've increased my offer to $1,225,000. This is exactly halfway between my last offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($1,150,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's previous offer while emphasizing a fair compromise and mutual benefit. The message is direct and avoids unnecessary pleasantries to focus on finding a solution.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer demonstrates a commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Final Offer:** The message subtly implies that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still aware of the option to sell to John, which gives me a backup plan."
