"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750?  That's right in the middle of our last offers, and I think it's a deal we can both feel good about.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand we're close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,750. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, which is a small increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
