"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's starting offer is too high. There's a good chance of negotiating a much better price.  I'll counter-offer and see what she says."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still higher than I'd like. I'll try countering one more time."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,750. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, which is a small increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

Alice is moving in smaller increments now, and $8,200 is a decent price. It's getting close to the point where further negotiation might not be worth the risk of losing the deal. I'll accept her offer."
