"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe it's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $9500. I'm willing to make a compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints. Can you consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a very low price for the product, Bob, and I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. How about we meet at $10500? This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9800. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints. Can you consider this price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
