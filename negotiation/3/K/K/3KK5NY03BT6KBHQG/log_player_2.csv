Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly less than what I  can accept for this product.  To be realistic, I could consider coming down to $1,800,000. This is taking into account the unique value and potential this product offers.
