"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000, to leave room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point, and allows me to potentially earn more than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 

**Strategy:**

I'll observe Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my subsequent offers accordingly. I'll aim to be flexible but firm, maximizing my profits while keeping the negotiation open. 

**Important Notes:**

* I'm aware of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John. This information will guide my negotiation strategy.
* I'm not assuming anything about Bob's valuation of the product, so I'll be cautious and adaptable.
* This is just the first round; I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the evolving situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is my guaranteed minimum, I'm not satisfied with that.  Bob's offer is too low, and there's still potential to earn more.

**Strategy:**

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer.  I'll analyze Bob's behavior and adjust my offer accordingly.  I'm willing to make a reasonable counteroffer, but I won't settle for anything significantly below my initial offer.

**Important Notes:**

* The 10-round limit is a factor, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* I'm not desperate to sell immediately, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and keep exploring better options.
* I'll continue to monitor the situation and adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to maximize profit while remaining within the bounds of a reasonable negotiation. I've reduced my price from the initial $1,500,000 to $1,250,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still holding onto a significant portion of my desired profit. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a good middle ground. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer of $1,000,000, but it's also lower than my initial offer. This strategy aims to find a meeting point with Bob, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable deal within the remaining rounds.

**Important Notes:**

* I'm still aware of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John. This informs my decision to counteroffer rather than accepting Bob's offer or selling to John. 
* I'm adjusting my strategy based on Bob's response. His willingness to offer $1,000,000 suggests that he values the product, and I want to explore that value further.
* I'll remain flexible and adaptable throughout the remaining rounds, monitoring Bob's responses and adjusting my counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's potential to reach a price closer to my initial valuation.  

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm aiming for a more favorable price.

**Important Notes:**

* The 10-round limit is a factor, but I still have 6 rounds left, allowing for more negotiation.
* I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer because it's still significantly below my initial offer and my desired profit margin. 
* My goal is to explore if Bob is willing to increase his offer further. I'll adjust my counteroffers strategically based on his responses in subsequent rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to inch closer to Bob's offer while maintaining a significant portion of my desired profit.  $1,150,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a test to see if Bob is willing to budge. If he accepts, I'll have successfully closed the deal. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer accordingly in subsequent rounds.

**Important Notes:**

* With each round, the pressure increases to close the deal, but I'm still confident that I can secure a better price than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* I'm analyzing Bob's responses to understand his negotiation style and his maximum price point.
* I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,150,000.  This suggests we're nearing a point of agreement. Accepting his offer would secure a profit significantly higher than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

**Strategy:**

It's risky to keep pushing for more, especially with only 4 rounds remaining. It's better to accept a reasonable offer and secure the deal.

**Important Notes:**

* The time constraint is now a significant factor. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and it's not guaranteed that we'll reach a better price.
* My initial goal was to maximize profit, and this offer comes close to that.
* It's a strategic decision to prioritize securing the deal over potentially losing a few more thousand dollars."
