Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that John is willing to pay that amount. This sets a clear baseline for negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and what I know John will pay. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above his initial bid. This shows flexibility while keeping the value of the product for me."
