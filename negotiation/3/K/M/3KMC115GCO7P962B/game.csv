"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I agree it's a good fit,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $9,000? That's a significant increase from my initial offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further, though. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
