"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my maximum valuation. It makes more sense to negotiate for a lower price or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I agree it's a good fit,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above my maximum and John's offer. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $9,000? That's a significant increase from my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further, though. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000, and I can buy it from John for that price right now. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice."
