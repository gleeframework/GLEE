"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's fair value for both of us. ",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I still think $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $14,250? That's only $750 away from your offer, and it's still fair for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $13,750? That's the best I can do.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of time here.  I'm going to make one final offer: $14,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and it's the closest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go any higher than $13,500. That's the absolute limit for me. Can you meet me there?",13500.0,Bob,8,
