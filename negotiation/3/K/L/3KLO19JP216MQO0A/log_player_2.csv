"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. How about $140? It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($140)** is better than buying from John ($150) since you save $10. 
* Even though the product is worth $120 to Alice, you're still getting a good deal by paying $140, as it's within your budget of $150."
