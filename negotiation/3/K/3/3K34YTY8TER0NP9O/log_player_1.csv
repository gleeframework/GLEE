Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **My minimum:** I value the product at $100.
* **John's offer:** I have a backup offer of $100 from John.

By offering $115, I am:

* **Maximizing my profit:** I earn $15 more than my minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob may still be willing to accept, as he values the product higher. 
* **Minimizing risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum value."
