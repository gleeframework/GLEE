Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $100. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $100.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $80. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can come to an agreement."
