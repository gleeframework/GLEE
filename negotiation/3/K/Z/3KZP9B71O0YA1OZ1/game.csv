"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $850,000, so I'll offer $775,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $775,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to pay $825,000. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, which is closer to my target of $800,000. Can you meet me at this price?",795000.0,Bob,6,
