"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120, and John is selling the product for $120, there is no reason to negotiate with Alice. It's better to buy from John and get the product immediately."
