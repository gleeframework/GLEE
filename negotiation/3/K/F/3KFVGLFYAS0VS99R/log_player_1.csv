"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm getting a good price.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $147.50?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 147.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering too low, even with his ""final"" offer.  I'll counter again, but this time I'll be getting closer to my minimum acceptable price to see if he'll budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $115? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to counteroffer, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm better off selling to John for $150 and ensuring I get a good price for my product."
