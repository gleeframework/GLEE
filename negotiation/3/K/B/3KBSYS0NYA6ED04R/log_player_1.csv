I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product, given its value to him, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my last offer and Bob's.  It's still above my minimum price, and hopefully,  Bob will see this as a fair price given his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not confident that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation.  Since John is offering me my minimum, I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
