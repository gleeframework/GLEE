Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable value."
