"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
