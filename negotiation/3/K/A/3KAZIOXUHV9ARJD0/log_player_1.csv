Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the ""true value"" of the product to emphasize the potential bargain for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates that I am willing to negotiate, which encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Plan B:**  I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, which gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $900000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially push the price closer to my desired range.
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides me with the flexibility to reject low offers and continue negotiating. 

I believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a final price I'm willing to consider, given the true value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Finality:**  The message emphasizes that this is my ""final price,"" adding pressure for Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the ""true value"" of the product to reinforce the potential bargain. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my backup buyer's offer, ensuring I have leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $910000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still $90,000 below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiation is getting prolonged, and it's likely that further counteroffers will only result in small price increments.
* **Time Cost:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob is a drain on my time and resources.
* **Guaranteed Deal:**  Selling to John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a significantly better outcome than potentially accepting a lower offer from Bob.

Given the time commitment and the potential risk of further negotiation, selling to John guarantees me the highest return and minimizes the risk of a lower outcome."
