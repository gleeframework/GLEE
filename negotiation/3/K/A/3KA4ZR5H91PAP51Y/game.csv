"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $10,000 to me, and I know I can get a similar one elsewhere for around that price.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 to make this deal happen quickly.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,000. Considering its value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000.  That's a fair price considering I have other options available.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm still looking to get a good profit from this sale. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,5,
