"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  By rejecting Alice's offer, he can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal. Offering $120 is a strong starting point, and  he believes there is room for negotiation to reach a price both he and Alice find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's within Bob's budget, and it's lower than his initial counteroffer.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
