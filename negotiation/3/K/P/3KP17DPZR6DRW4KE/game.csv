"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $680000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $725000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession.

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still not willing to go above $700000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your last two offers, which would be $722750. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",722750.0,Bob,6,
