Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, it's more beneficial to sell to John and ensure a profit."
