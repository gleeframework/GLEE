"I understand you're on a budget, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $11250 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
