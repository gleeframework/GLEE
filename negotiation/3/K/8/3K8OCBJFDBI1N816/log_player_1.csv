Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects a mutually beneficial opportunity. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a deal quickly. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving me bargaining power. However, it also offers Bob a substantial discount compared to my backup offer from John.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and collaboration, making it more likely for Bob to engage in a discussion."
