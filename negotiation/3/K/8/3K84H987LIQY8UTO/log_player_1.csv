Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $15,000 (which is Bob's valuation), you are anchoring the price in his mind and making your offer seem more reasonable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, there's no need to reveal that to Bob. Keeping the possibility of other buyers strengthens your position."
