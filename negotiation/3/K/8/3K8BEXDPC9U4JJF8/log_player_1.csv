Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This represents a substantial discount on its true worth to you, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, my goal is to earn the most I can. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving me room to negotiate above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, a strong incentive for him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob counters, but still keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price."
