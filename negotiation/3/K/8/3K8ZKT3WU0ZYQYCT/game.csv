"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant value for you and still allows me to make a good profit.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. It's a great product, but I have to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  However,  $980,000 just doesn't work for me. Let's try $1,020,000. This gives you a great deal and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000. How about $990,000?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  Let's try $1,005,000.  I'm really trying to meet you halfway here.  This is my final offer before I move on to other options.  What do you say?",1005000.0,Alice,7,
