"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $10,000. It's still a great deal for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's significantly lower than my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's desired price point.**  $11,500 is a good compromise, especially since Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **There's a risk in further negotiation.**  If Bob rejects again, Alice might not be willing to budge further, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Accepting secures a good deal.** By accepting, Bob gets the product for a significant discount compared to John's offer."
