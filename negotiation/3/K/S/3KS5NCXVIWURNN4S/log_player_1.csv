Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $22,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm prepared to offer $8,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle on $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $18,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer to a fair deal, I can't let it go for less than $16,000.  I'm confident you'll find incredible value at this price."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  $16,000 is still quite a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer beyond $12,000. Accepting his current offer means losing out on a potential $3,000 profit. It's in your best interest to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
