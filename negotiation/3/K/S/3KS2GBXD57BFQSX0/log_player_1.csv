{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a bit below my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully sparks Bob's interest. If he rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and weigh it against selling to John for the full $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I would prefer not to lose the sale, $9,000 is far too low. I'll counter with a price closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $9,000 is quite a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I think is fair considering the value it brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is still below my minimum, it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer. It's close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale."
