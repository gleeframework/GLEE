``` 

This offer represents a decent compromise:

* **It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable price:** This ensures I have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.

I've also left room for a friendly opening message to encourage a positive interaction."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.
