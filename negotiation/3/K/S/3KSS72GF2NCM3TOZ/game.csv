"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we meet halfway between our last offers, at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think $135 is a good starting point. Let's try $145. This is a significant investment for you, so it's important we find a price that works for both of us. ",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're right, Alice, finding the right price is important. How about we settle at $140? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $140 is closer, but I'm still holding out for $142.  It's a small difference, and I think it's fair considering the value of this product.",142.0,Alice,7,
