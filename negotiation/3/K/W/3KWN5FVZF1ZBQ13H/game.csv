"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500. I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
