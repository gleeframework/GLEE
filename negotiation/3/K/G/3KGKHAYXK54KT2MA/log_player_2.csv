"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $10,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,000 is my absolute bottom line.  Let's try to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now at her lowest price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially missing out on the product, especially since you can get it for the same price from John."
