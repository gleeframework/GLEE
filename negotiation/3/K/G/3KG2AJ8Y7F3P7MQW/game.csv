"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That seems like a fair compromise.",85.0,Bob,4,
