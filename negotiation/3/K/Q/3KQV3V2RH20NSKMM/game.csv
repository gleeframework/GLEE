"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm thinking of a price of $25000 for the product. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. Can you consider this price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $22000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $19500. Can you consider this price?",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $19500, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $21000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price given the product's value.",21000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $21000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $19000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can consider it.",19000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $19000, but I'm willing to meet you at the middle again. I can offer the product to you for $20500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price given the product's value. I'm starting to think that $19000 is getting too low for me.",20500.0,Alice,7,
