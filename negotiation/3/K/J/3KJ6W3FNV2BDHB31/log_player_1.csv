Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer, as my minimum price is $150 and I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to make a little more on this product. How about $175? This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $160 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I will accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum price of $150, it's still a better deal than selling to John.  I've already rejected his previous offer, and continuing to negotiate could risk him walking away altogether."
