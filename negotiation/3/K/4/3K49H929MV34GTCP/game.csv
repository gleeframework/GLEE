"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is my best price, and I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $9,800. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",9800.0,Alice,5,
