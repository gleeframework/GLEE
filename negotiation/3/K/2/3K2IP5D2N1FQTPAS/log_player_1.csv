"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really like. My asking price is $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly above what I believe Bob might be willing to pay. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate down, while still giving me a good starting point. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, or potentially even John if negotiations with Bob stall. 
* **Building leverage:**  Rejecting this offer shows Bob that I'm serious about my asking price and potentially makes him more likely to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm not budging on my minimum price, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a compromise.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** Highlighting the ""good deal"" for both of us can make Bob feel more inclined to agree.
* **Clear and concise:** I'm direct and to the point, avoiding unnecessary fluff."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.
* **Time is a factor:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to ensure I'm not wasting time on negotiations that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **John is a reliable backup:**  Selling to John for $100 is still a good option, and I don't want to risk settling for a lower price if I'm not confident Bob will go higher.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:**  By rejecting, I might incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Let's try $98. This is my final offer before I need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating that I'm willing to make a small compromise. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""final offer"" and ""other options"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision.
* **Highlighting Value:**  While I'm not explicitly stating John as an alternative, the implication is there, reminding Bob of the opportunity cost of not closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $92. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the likelihood of Bob agreeing to a price closer to my minimum is diminishing.
* **John's offer is secure:** I know John will buy the product for $100, which is more than Bob's current offer.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I continue to negotiate with Bob, I risk the possibility of either running out of time or him not increasing his offer enough for me to accept.

By selling to John, I guarantee myself a profit of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's the safest and most sensible choice given the current situation."
