{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message to build rapport and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. The price is set at $140, which is slightly above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see how Bob responds and to gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum valuation of $150.  While I'd like to sell it to Bob, I'm not willing to accept a price that low.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $135? That's still a great price for this amazing product, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my desired price, but it's closer to my minimum valuation. It's also a good midpoint between our last offers. To avoid further negotiation and potential risk of losing the deal entirely, I'll accept Bob's offer."
