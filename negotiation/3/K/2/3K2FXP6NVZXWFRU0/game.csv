"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate it.  However, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000, so I'm thinking $15,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",15000.0,Alice,5,
