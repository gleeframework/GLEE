"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $80 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle. How about $95? It's a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.
