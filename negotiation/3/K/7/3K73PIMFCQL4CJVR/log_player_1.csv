{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it also gives me some room to negotiate if needed.  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120 if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120, so I'm rejecting his offer.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $80 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle. How about $95? It's a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we try $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.5 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to move closer to $95. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit further. How about $92.50? This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still a bit below my desired price point, it's getting closer to what I need.  It's also a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, which means I'm still getting a good deal.  Rather than risking that Bob will walk away and I'll have to sell to John for $120, I'm going to accept this offer and secure the sale."
