"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I'd like to offer you. I'm asking for $180, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I still have room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to explore if there's a higher price point Bob is willing to pay. I can use this round to send a counteroffer closer to my initial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $150? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, I still have some room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to see if he's willing to go even higher. If he's not willing to budge, I can always sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm not willing to go down to $135,  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $142.50?  Let's try to find a solution we both agree on."", ""product_price"": 142.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I still have two rounds left and can potentially get a better deal. I believe I can get him to increase his offer to $135 or even closer to my desired price of $142.50 in the next round.  Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. I understand your limit is $130, but I can't go lower than $135. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in this negotiation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you can't go lower than $135, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $128 for the product. This is my final offer, please consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final round to negotiate with Bob. His offer of $128 is only $8 less than my minimum desired price and $8 more than selling to John. With only two rounds left, I have a high chance of not getting a better offer, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
