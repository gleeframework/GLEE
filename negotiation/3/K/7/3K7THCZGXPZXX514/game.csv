"Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm very interested in this product but I can't afford $1800000.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1800000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your maximum offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that my offer of $800000 is a fair price, considering my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go any higher than that.  Let's see if we can make this work.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go back to my original offer of $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your maximum offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
