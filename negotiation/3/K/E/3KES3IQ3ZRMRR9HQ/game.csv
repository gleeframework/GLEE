"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $12,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,3,
