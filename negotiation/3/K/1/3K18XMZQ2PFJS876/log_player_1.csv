Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is because:

* **It's my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than this.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can potentially negotiate a price closer to his value of $800,000. 
* **I have a backup:**  If Bob rejects and negotiations break down, I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 

This strategy gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while also leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to my minimum:**  $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Minimizes risk:**  By accepting, I secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a breakdown in talks. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process, and I have a guaranteed sale with John as a backup.

While I'd prefer to get $1,000,000, this is a good compromise that maximizes my profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
