Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob values it at $1,200,000. This presents a $400,000 potential profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a potential $100,000 gain, making the offer very attractive. 
* **First-mover Advantage:** By offering Bob the product first, we increase the likelihood of securing a higher price, even if it means slightly lowering the initial asking price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob finds the offer too good to refuse."
