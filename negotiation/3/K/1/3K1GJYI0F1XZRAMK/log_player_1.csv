Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you (Alice) can send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit higher than the midpoint ($1,100,000) allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little while still keeping Alice well above her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to settle for anything less. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher. If Bob is known to be fair, this offer might be spot on.
* **Relationship:** If Alice wants to maintain a good relationship with Bob, being overly aggressive might not be the best strategy."
