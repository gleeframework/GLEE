"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I have 9 more rounds to reach a deal, so I'm not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a better outcome. With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000.  This is a further compromise, but I'm confident that it's still a fair price for the product.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally be willing to accept this offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $15,600. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not sure if I can get a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  While I would have preferred a higher price, this is still a good profit for me."
