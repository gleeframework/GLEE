* Alice's offer of $115 is still above your target of $150, but it's the closest she's gotten.
* You have only 5 rounds left.
* If you reject this offer, you risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate, and you could end up paying more or even having to buy from John at $150. 
* It's a good compromise, and you're still saving $35 compared to John."
