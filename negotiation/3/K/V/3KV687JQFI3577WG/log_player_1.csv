"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message can help create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob to potentially sway him towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I could accept and make a small profit, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my target price.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $120, giving me a better deal. However, I want to see if I can get a price closer to $120 from Bob. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price.
* **Compromise:** I highlight the fact that I'm willing to compromise to show good faith.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Improvement:** Although the difference is getting smaller, I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with more rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $120, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob yet.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  It's just a small step up from your offer, but it allows me to stay closer to my target price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making another counteroffer, this time splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Middle Ground:** Emphasizing that this is a ""middle ground"" solution can make it seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Focus on Small Step:** Highlighting that it's a ""small step up"" from Bob's offer can make the price seem more acceptable.
* **Target Price:**  I'm still working towards my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited Room for Improvement:**  The negotiation is getting close to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a much higher price from Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $120 is still a better option than selling to Bob for $92. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to do one more compromise. Let's meet at $94. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm making one last counteroffer, hoping to reach a compromise that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Fair Price:**  I emphasize that this price is fair to both sides to make it more appealing. 
* **Moving Forward:**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if he accepts.
* **John's Offer:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $120 as it's a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $91? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $91 is dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. There's very little room for improvement at this point.
* **Limited Negotiation Power:**  I've already made several compromises, and it's unlikely Bob will go significantly higher.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $120 is a much better deal for me, as it's significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a better price. It's time to accept John's offer and sell the product for $120."
