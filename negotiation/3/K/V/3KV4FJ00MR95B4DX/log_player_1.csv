Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.
* This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* I'm trying to maximize my profit, but I'm also considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  
* If he does reject, I can still sell it to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money. 

This strategy balances the potential for a higher profit with the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
