Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  While the product is only worth $80 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives it as a good deal.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so I don't need to go below that price with Bob.

By starting high, I leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing anything because I can sell it to John at my desired price."
