Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,200,000 for the product. This is her ""reservation price.""
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 if Bob declines.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price that is:

* **Higher than her reservation price:** To maximize profit.
* **Lower than Bob's valuation:**  To ensure Bob finds the deal acceptable.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in. Considering its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Why this works:**

* **Strong but fair:** The message positions the price as justified by the product's value.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  While a strong opening, it doesn't completely exhaust Bob's potential willingness to pay, allowing for some back-and-forth if needed.
* **Significantly above Alice's alternative:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is highly likely to get a better deal than selling to John. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or other factors that might influence his decision. In a real negotiation, gathering more information about the other party is always beneficial."
