"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. While I want to find a deal, accepting a $10,000 loss isn't an option. I'll try to negotiate, but I'm keeping John in mind.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still pushing my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is slowly moving up, but it's still a long way from what I need.  I'll counter, but John is looking more and more appealing.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for working with me.  Let's try $15,500.  This is a great price for a product this valuable."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $12,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough one. Bob has hit his maximum price, and while I could push for more, it's unlikely he'll budge. Taking $12,000 is better than losing the sale, but John guarantees $15,000.  

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I could keep negotiating with Bob, it's risky.  John's offer is guaranteed, and waiting might not yield a better result."
