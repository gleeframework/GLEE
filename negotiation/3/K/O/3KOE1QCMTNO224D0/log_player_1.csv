Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down and still make a profit.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth a lot to me, which could make him more willing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below the $100 minimum I've set for myself. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** I can still sell to John for $100 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob that meets my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob that the price is still a good deal for him, highlighting the benefits of accepting the offer.
* **Closing the gap:**  $95 is still above my minimum, but it's closer to Bob's offer and could increase the likelihood of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $90?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is finally above my minimum of $100, meaning I will make a profit.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  While I could continue negotiating, the chances of getting a higher price are slim.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could waste time and potentially lead to a stalemate.  Selling to Bob for $90 is a secure way to make a profit."
