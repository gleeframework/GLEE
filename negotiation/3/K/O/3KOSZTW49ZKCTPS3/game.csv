"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's try to come to a final agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
