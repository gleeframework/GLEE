"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $15,000. It's a fair price for both of us, as it's the maximum I can afford and still get a great deal. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $15,000, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",16000.0,Alice,5,
