,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $9,800? That's my final offer, and I really think it's a fair price for the product.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,800 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $10,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. This is a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
