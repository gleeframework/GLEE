"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering your asking price and the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $10,500 doesn't quite meet my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to secure a fair return. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. This is a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
