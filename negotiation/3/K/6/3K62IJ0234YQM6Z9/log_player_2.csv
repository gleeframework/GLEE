"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering your asking price and the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $10,500 doesn't quite meet my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to secure a fair return. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob can continue negotiating with Alice and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. This is a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
