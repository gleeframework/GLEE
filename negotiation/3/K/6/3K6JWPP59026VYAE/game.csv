"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  This product offers significant long-term value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has long-term value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, which is closer to my initial target. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
