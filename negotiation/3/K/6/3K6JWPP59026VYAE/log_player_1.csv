Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now getting too close to John's guaranteed offer.  While I might be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, the risk of him walking away and losing the $1,500,000 from John is too great. It's time to take the guaranteed win."
