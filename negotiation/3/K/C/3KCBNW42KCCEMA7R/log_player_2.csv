"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  My initial offer is $1,000,000.  Let's talk about how this can benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,000,000 is a decent price, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $900,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $950,000.  This gives you a substantial discount and allows me to recover a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of saving as much money as possible. There's still some room for negotiation, especially since Alice is showing willingness to compromise. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $940,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price range and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of reaching a stalemate or needing to buy from John at a higher price is increasing with each round.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and minimizes potential risks."
