"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $900,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $950,000.  This gives you a substantial discount and allows me to recover a fair price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
