"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob! However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $155 again, but this time I'll throw in a small bonus - I'll include a free accessory that's worth $10. That way, you'll get a great deal, and I'll still make a profit. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,7,
