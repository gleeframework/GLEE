"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it's not the absolute lowest price you could theoretically get for the product, accepting Alice's offer at $14,000 is the best decision. Here's why:

* **Saving money:**  You save $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Uncertainty of further negotiation:** Rejecting Alice's offer hoping for a lower price is risky. She might not budge much, and you'd end up paying more through John."
