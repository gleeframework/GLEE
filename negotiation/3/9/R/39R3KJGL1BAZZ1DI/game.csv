,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there. How about $108? It's a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",108.0,Bob,4,
