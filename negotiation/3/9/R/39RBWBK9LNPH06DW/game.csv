"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
