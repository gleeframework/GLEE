"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price that's still attractive to you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the value of this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm prepared to offer $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit.

This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
