"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price that's still attractive to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the value of this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm prepared to offer $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
