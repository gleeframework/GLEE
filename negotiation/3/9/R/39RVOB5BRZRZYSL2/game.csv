"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get you on board. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $850,000? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000.  Would you consider $810,000?",810000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $800,000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. To be frank, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $800,000. If you're willing to match that, I'll buy it from you today.  If not, I'll have to consider my other option.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have other options, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to match the $800,000 price. I think the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll make one final offer: $825,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,7,
