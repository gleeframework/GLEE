{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but staying below $1,500,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still keeping some room for further negotiation.  With only 4 rounds left, I need to start considering the risk of running out of time.  If Alice rejects this offer, I will have to weigh whether to accept John's offer in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now within my budget, I'm still hoping for a better price.  We're down to the final few rounds, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars in savings.  If Alice rejects my counteroffer, I'll be prepared to accept John's offer in the next round to avoid losing out on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer one last time, but staying just below Alice's last offer. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not willing to go any higher.  With only two rounds left, I need to make a move that balances saving money and avoiding missing out on the deal. If Alice rejects this, I'll accept John's offer in the next round."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the closest we've gotten to my ideal price.  With only one round remaining, I need to make a decision.  While I could try to negotiate a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject my offer and I'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price within my budget."
