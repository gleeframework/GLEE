Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'll also be keeping John's offer in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer.  While $12,000 from John is tempting, I'm hoping I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my value than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this is a reasonable compromise and that Bob will be more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer. I'm starting to feel the pressure from John's offer, so I'll need to be strategic with my next move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm coming down a bit more, but I'm still trying to get as much as I can. I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob, but I'm also aware that John's offer is always a possibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm starting to think I'm not going to get much more from him.  I'd rather lock in a guaranteed $12,000 than risk another round and potentially end up with less."
