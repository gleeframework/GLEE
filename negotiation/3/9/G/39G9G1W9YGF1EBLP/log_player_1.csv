Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at this price?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,200,000 meets my minimum, I believe there is room for negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get a better price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1225000. Can you consider this offer?

I'm still hesitant to accept $1,225,000.  I believe we can find a slightly higher price that's still fair to both of us. I'll counter Bob's offer again."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1275000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is refusing to budge on his offer of $1,200,000, which is my minimum.  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk he won't budge further.  I'm better off selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
