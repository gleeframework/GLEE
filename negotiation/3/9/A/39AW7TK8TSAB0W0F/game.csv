"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see the value in this product is high for you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it. That's the lowest I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? That's my final offer.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and $11,500, which would be $11,125. That's the best I can do. Would you consider that?",11125.0,Alice,7,
