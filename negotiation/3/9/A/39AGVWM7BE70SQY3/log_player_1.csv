Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing the offer as a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $1,200,000, there's a chance Bob will counteroffer, allowing me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 provides a backup option and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can push for a better price by rejecting Bob's counteroffer and making a new one. 
* **John Provides Leverage:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer that is still higher than his offer, but closer to his perceived value of the product.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the value the product offers to Bob to reinforce the justification for my counter-offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and suggesting we can reach an agreement. 
* **Using John as Leverage (Implicitly):**  The fact that I have a backup option with John allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Could we agree on $1,050,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for a loss.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer.
* **Using John as Leverage:**  Having John as a backup option gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price.

I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit away from your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still trying to secure a higher price. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize how this price would benefit both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While this counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, thanks to the backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose $1,060,000 as a compromise. This allows for a fair deal while keeping the price within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still a significant loss for me. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  There's a risk of going back and forth with Bob and potentially ending up with a price that's even lower than his current offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is more than I would get from Bob at this point. It's the safer and more financially beneficial option.

Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John to ensure a secure and profitable outcome."
