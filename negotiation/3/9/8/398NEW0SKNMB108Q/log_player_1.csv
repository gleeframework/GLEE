Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. 
* This price is higher than John's offer of $10,000, giving me the potential to earn more. 
* Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob values the product at $15,000 or more, he'll accept the offer. 
* If he values it lower, he'll reject it, but I'll still be able to sell it to John for $10,000, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum value."
