"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value.  This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping that this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. Even though he's lowered his price again, it's still below my minimum value.  With 6 rounds left, I'm confident that we can reach a better agreement. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price than the previous round, hoping to inch closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12250}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $12,250. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob. It's a small enough difference that it might be tempting for Bob to accept, but it still keeps me above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I've only got 4 rounds left and I'm not sure I'll be able to get him to budge enough. John is offering me my minimum value, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
