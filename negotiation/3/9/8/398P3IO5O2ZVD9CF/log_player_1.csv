Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $175.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm offering $165, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I would prefer to get $165 or even $175, Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge from $150.  I'd rather get the guaranteed $150 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
