"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value is worth $1500000 to you. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the optimal choice."
