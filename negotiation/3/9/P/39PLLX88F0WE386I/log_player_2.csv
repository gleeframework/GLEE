"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more appropriate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $9,000 is cutting it very close to the value of this product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $10,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  What do you think?
