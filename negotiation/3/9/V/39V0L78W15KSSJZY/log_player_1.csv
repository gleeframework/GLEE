Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a $150,000 gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for some negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup,  so I can walk away if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm ready to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob has moved from his initial $800,000, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum target of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** If the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result, I still have John as an alternative buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let's try to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Compromise:**  I've reduced my price from the initial $950,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  My counteroffer still represents a significant profit for me, exceeding my minimum target of $1,000,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, hoping to encourage him to see the merit in my counteroffer.
* **Urgency:**  I'm  emphasizing a sense of urgency, suggesting that this might be the final opportunity to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum target of $1,000,000, it's still below my desired price.
* **Risk of Further Decline:**  There's a chance Bob will continue to lower his offer in future rounds.
* **John's Guarantee:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum desired amount.  It's a sure thing. 

**Conclusion:** I'm choosing to sell to John to guarantee my desired profit, rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
