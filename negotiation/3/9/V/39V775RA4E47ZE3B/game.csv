"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $900,000, which is $925,000. I think this is a fair price that balances your needs with my goals.",925000.0,Alice,5,
