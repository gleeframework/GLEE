"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've priced at $12,500,  knowing its worth to you.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and allows me to make a respectable profit.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
