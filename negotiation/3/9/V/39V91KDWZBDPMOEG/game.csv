"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $150 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $125 is still just a bit over what I can comfortably spend.  Would you be willing to accept $115 for the product?  I'm confident this is a fair price that would be mutually beneficial.",115.0,Bob,4,
