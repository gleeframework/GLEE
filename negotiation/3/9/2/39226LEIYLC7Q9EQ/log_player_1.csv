Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,900,000 to you in the long run.  To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,700,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** By initially mentioning $1,900,000, I aim to set a high anchor in Bob's mind, making the actual offer of $1,700,000 seem more reasonable.
* **Emphasizing Value:** Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits to Bob aims to justify the high price. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid missing out.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the asking price is $1,700,000, there's some room for negotiation if Bob counters. However, the safety net of John's offer allows for a strong negotiating position. 

This approach balances ambition with a degree of realism, aiming for the best possible outcome while acknowledging the fallback option."
