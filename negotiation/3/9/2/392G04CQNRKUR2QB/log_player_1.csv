"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's still a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you'd be willing to pay. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if this doesn't work out."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  How about we split the difference again?  I'm willing to come down to $1,037,500.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, $1,012,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating with Bob. I can also always sell to John for $1,200,000 if it doesn't work out with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,012,500 is still not enough for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a competitive price and me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,005,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to walking away from the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,005,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $1,005,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm not thrilled to be selling for less than I'd like, it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000, which is a more acceptable price."
