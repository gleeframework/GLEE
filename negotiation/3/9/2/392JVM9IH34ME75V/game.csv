"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $16000? It's closer to where I need to be.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I'm still not quite there with $17000. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $16500. This is my final offer.",16500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more move. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16800. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",16800.0,Alice,7,
