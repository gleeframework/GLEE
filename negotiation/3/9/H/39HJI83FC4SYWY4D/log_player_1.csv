"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, knowing that the product is worth $150 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I want to get as much as possible, I'm not being overly aggressive in the first offer. I'm leaving room for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** While $130 is a good offer, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price range.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is still interested in the product, so there's no need to rush into accepting his counteroffer.
* **Room for compromise:** I can still lower my price slightly in the next round, but I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm still hoping to get closer to $135 for this unique product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price slightly from $140 to $135.
* **Maintaining value:**  I'm still aiming for a price that is above my minimum acceptable offer of $120.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by using a question in my message to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $132. Can you meet me in the middle at $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $132.50 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer again, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By accepting, I'm securing a good price without the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower offer or losing time."
