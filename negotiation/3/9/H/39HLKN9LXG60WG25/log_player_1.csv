Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've started with a price of $14,000, which is slightly below Bob's perceived value but still gives me a good profit margin. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** The message also leaves room for negotiation by stating ""Let me know what you think!""  This allows Bob to make a counteroffer if he wishes. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my profits while also being open to negotiation. By starting with a high price, I can potentially get a higher sale price than if I started lower. However, by being open to negotiation and having a backup buyer in John, I ensure that I won't lose out on a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I could accept and secure a sale, I believe there's still room for negotiation and the potential to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $13,000? That would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise. It's a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Positive and Reasonable Tone:** The message emphasizes the ""good deal"" for Bob, making the offer more appealing.  It also explains my rationale for the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with ""Let me know what you think"", leaving room for further discussion and potentially finding a mutually acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground.  I'm showing flexibility while still protecting my interests.  By demonstrating willingness to negotiate, I hope to secure a sale at a price that is fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on the potential profit.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential gain.  Selling to John at $12,000 secures a profitable deal and avoids further uncertainty."
