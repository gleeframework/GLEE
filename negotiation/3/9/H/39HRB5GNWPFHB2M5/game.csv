"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $17,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $17,000. I can meet you halfway at $18,500. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $17,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",17750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $19,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $17,750 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,5,
