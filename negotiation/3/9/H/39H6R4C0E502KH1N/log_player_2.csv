**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the realm of possibility, given that I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000. This initial counteroffer allows for some room for negotiation. It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product but also that I'm not willing to accept her initial price."
