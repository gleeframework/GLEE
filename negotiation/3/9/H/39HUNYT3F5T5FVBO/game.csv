"Alice, your initial offer is way too high.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While your offer is tempting, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's unique benefits.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I appreciate that.  While your offer is getting closer, I'm still seeking a price that reflects its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $1,700,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident that we can both walk away happy with this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
