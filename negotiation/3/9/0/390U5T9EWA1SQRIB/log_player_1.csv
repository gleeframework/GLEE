Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $12,000 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it slightly below Bob's perceived value ($10,000) gives him a strong incentive to buy while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially increasing my profit even further."
