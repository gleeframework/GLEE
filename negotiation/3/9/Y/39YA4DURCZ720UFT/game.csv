"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $650,000. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $650,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $675,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of offering $680,000. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,5,
