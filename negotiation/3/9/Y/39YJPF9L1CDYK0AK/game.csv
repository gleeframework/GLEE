"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $7,000 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $8,200? This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good price while ensuring I get a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,800 and $8,200. Would you consider $7,950? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",7950.0,Bob,6,
