"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is only worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $130. This indicates she's trying to get a good deal.
* **Counteroffering is a better strategy:**  You can likely negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is not the best option:**  John's price is higher than your maximum budget of $150.  

By rejecting the offer, you'll have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Fair offer:**  $100 is still above Alice's value for the product ($80),  giving her some room to profit. 
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes your desire to find a fair price, rather than simply trying to get the lowest price. This can help build rapport and encourage Alice to consider your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable compromise:** Alice's counteroffer of $115 is a compromise between her original offer ($130) and your counteroffer ($100). 
* **Within your budget:**  $115 is well within your maximum budget of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While you could counteroffer again, the chances of Alice accepting a lower price are slim.  

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a price that is both acceptable to you and likely the best you can achieve in this negotiation."
