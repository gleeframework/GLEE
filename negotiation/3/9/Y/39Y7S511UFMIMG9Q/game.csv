"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me halfway and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $750000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $820000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",820000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $820000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $820000, which would be $785000. Can you consider this offer and see if we can come to an agreement?",785000.0,Bob,6,
