Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount more than my minimum value of $10,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It's important to start high, but also be prepared to compromise to get the best outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, but it's not a huge difference. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price of $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that he'll be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value, but it's not a huge difference.  I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. This will ensure I get my minimum value for the product and avoid further negotiation."
