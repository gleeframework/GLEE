"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. As for the price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $14,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a bit more reasonable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $12,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, but I may have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
