Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider my offer?

I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm confident in the unique value this product offers that others don't. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're firm on the value of the product, but I'm not willing to pay $12,500. I'd like to make one more offer of $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product offers. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,500, Bob is clearly signaling he won't budge much higher. Accepting $11,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer altogether."
