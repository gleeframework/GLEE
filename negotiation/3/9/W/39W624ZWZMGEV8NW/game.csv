"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm serious about this product and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
