"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. However, the price of $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
