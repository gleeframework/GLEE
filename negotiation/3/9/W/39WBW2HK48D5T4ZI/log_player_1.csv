Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. However, the price of $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the gap between his valuation and my minimum price is still substantial. Accepting $950,000 would mean losing out on a significant amount of potential profit. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price."
