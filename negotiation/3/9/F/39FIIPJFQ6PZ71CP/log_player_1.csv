Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable paying $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still not enough for me to let go of this valuable product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within your budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much, and we've already gone through several rounds.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I want.  I don't want to risk losing too much time and potentially ending up with a lower offer, so I'll go with John's offer of $1,500,000."
