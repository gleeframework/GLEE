Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm very close to my limit. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  If we can't reach an agreement here, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move much further than his $950,000 offer.  At this stage, accepting John's offer of $1,000,000 is the most logical choice. While a deal with Bob could potentially go slightly higher, it's not worth risking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, especially with several rounds remaining."
