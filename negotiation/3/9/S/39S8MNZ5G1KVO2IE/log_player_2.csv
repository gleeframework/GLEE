"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer keeps the door open to potentially secure a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10,500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $10,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's last offer. Bob is looking to save as much money as possible, but the deal is getting close to his desired price.  Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price, and he only needs to spend a little more than his original counteroffer.  It's also worth noting that if he rejects this offer and makes a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and he might end up with a worse deal or having to buy from John at a much higher price."
