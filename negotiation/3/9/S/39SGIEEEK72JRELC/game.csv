"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential benefits it holds for you.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in this product,  $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, given it's worth $800,000 to you. This would give us both a solid profit margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. While your offer is tempting, I believe it undervalues the potential returns it offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair compromise for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a decent profit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,175,000, but I need you to understand this is my final offer.  This price reflects the true value of the product and represents a significant profit for both of us. I believe it's a fair and reasonable deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
