"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer ($1,350,000) that's significantly closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and frame it as a worthwhile investment for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting point"" signals willingness to negotiate, preventing an immediate deadlock. 

This strategy aims to anchor the negotiation high and gauge Bob's eagerness to purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in this product,  $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, given it's worth $800,000 to you. This would give us both a solid profit margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant profit, it's crucial to remember our goal is to maximize earnings. Accepting now leaves a potential $500,000 on the table (Bob's perceived value minus his offer). We still have negotiating power and time on our side. 

We'll counter in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000, striking a balance between profit and the risk of losing the deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. While your offer is tempting, I believe it undervalues the potential returns it offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession from our previous offer ($1,350,000 to $1,225,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to move closer to our desired price range. 
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes that this is a ""significant discount"" and a ""fair compromise,"" subtly putting pressure on Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to $1,225,000.
* **Avoiding Extremes:**  This counteroffer avoids being too close to either Bob's last offer ($1,000,000) or our initial price ($1,350,000), signaling we're willing to negotiate but won't drastically lower our expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a decent profit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving in the right direction, but we're still leaving potential profit on the table. While $1,100,000 is a good profit, accepting now means losing out on a potential $100,000 or more.  

We'll continue negotiating in the next round, but we'll need to be strategic. A counteroffer around $1,175,000 might be a good middle ground, but we also need to start considering our fallback option of selling to John as the rounds progress."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,175,000, but I need you to understand this is my final offer.  This price reflects the true value of the product and represents a significant profit for both of us. I believe it's a fair and reasonable deal."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we're introducing a sense of urgency and signaling that we're reaching the limit of our flexibility.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes that $1,175,000 is our bottom line while still highlighting the mutual benefits of the deal. 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating that the price reflects the ""true value"" to justify our stance and discourage further lowball offers. 

This approach aims to push Bob towards a decision while leaving some room for a final concession if absolutely necessary."
