Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy he's interested, $11,000 is too low for me. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $11,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a fair deal for both of us. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
