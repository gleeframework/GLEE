"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $14,000. It's worth every penny, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $11,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price. Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, so rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
