"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's initial offer is within Bob's budget, it doesn't give him any room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to lower the price and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to do $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows his willingness to negotiate and creates room for a potential deal.  He's aiming to get a discount of 25%, which is a significant savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice rejecting the offer and potentially causing a stalemate. Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product for a fair price and move on."
