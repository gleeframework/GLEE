"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, we're getting close!  $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. Would you consider $8,900?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,
