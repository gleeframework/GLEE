"Hi Bob, I understand that my initial offer might have been a bit high for you. However, $80 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $120? This product is truly worth it, and I'm offering it to you at a significant discount from my original price.",120.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $100? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get a good deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
