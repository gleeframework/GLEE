"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8,750. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and the market rate.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $8,750 is getting close to my absolute bottom line. I'm willing to accept $8,900, but that's my final offer.  This is a great deal for a product you won't find anywhere else.",8900.0,Alice,5,
