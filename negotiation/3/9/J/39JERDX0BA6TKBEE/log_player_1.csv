"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,750,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,550,000.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the guaranteed offer from John."
