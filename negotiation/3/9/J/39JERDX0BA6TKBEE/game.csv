"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a valuable product.  I believe it's worth at least $1500000 to me, and I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $2000000. Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1750000. It reflects the product's value and allows us both to find common ground. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
