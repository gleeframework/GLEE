"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $700,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
