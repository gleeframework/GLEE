"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a deal, though.  I'd like to offer $1,075,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that's closer to both of our needs.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,075,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,087,500.  This feels like a fair compromise that's closer to both of our needs. ",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your coming down again.  $1,087,500 is still a bit too high for me.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $1,050,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,068,750.  This would be a fair compromise, and I think it would be a good deal for both of us.",1068750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $1,050,000. While I'm willing to continue negotiations, I can't go lower than $1,075,000 at this point. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find value in this deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
