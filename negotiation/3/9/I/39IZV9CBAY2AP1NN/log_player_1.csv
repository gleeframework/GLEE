"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find this offer enticing, considering the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I am willing to negotiate, his offer is too low. I'll reject it and counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm offering $1,650,000, which is still above my minimum value but shows flexibility.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still being a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price and also the price John is willing to pay.  There's no reason to continue negotiating, as I'm guaranteed to get my minimum value."
