Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value and our desired price range, I'd like to offer $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we see in the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

This reflects a fair price that balances both our interests and creates a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can come to an understanding.
