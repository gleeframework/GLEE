"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value and our desired price range, I'd like to offer $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we see in the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering our position, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. We believe this price still reflects the value the product brings to your business, while also being competitive with your desired price range.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This reflects a fair price that balances both our interests and creates a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can come to an understanding.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway. However, we're still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $815,000. We believe this price still reflects the value the product brings to your business, and we're willing to make a final compromise to reach an agreement.",815000.0,Alice,5,
