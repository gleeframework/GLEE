Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is clearly willing to move towards my price point, and $1,090,000 is a strong profit. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation stalling out and ending up with John's lower offer."
