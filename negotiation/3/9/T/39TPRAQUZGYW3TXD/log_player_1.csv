Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** This is the lowest price you're willing to accept ($1,500,000). It's your safety net because you have John as a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This is his likely ceiling for negotiation.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** This is the range where a deal can happen. It exists between your reservation price ($1,500,000) and Bob's likely maximum ($1,200,000).  The ZOPA seems small, but it's crucial you attempt to negotiate within it.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim high initially but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Here's how:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to discuss this product with you.  I've had significant interest, but I believe it could be a game-changer for someone with your vision. I'm initially offering it at $1,750,000. Given the value it brings, I'm confident this is a price that makes sense for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1750000 
}
```

**Explanation of the Offer**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting at $1,750,000 sets a high anchor. While it's above Bob's value, it provides room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** You're not just stating a price; you're highlighting the product's value and the high demand, justifying the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language implies you're open to discussion and finding a price that works for both parties.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob will likely counter-offer. Be prepared to go back and forth a few times. You can gradually reduce your price while emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Know Your Walk-Away Point:** If Bob won't budge above $1,500,000, you're better off selling to John.

**Remember, negotiation is about finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Good luck!**"
