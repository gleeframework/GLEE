"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. However, I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the price to reflect the value I believe the product holds. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
