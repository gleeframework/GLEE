"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? That would be a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $127.50? That's the highest I can go.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $127.50 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, let's settle at $129.  This way we both get a good deal.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $129 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $126? That's the best I can do.",126.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this.  I'm willing to go down to $128, but that's my final offer. If you're not able to meet that, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go down to $128, but I'm still not comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $128, which would be $124. Can you consider that?",124.0,Bob,8,
