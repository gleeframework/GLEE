"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $15000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13500 is closer, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $13000. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $13250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,
