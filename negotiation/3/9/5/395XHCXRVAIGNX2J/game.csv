"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing further, but I believe this reflects its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I acknowledge the product's value, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to offer $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
