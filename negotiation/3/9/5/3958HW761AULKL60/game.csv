"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints but $8,500 is too low for this product.  It's truly exceptional and worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to offer $9,500.  It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $9,500 is still quite a ways off from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's settle this right now -  $11,000 and it's yours.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $11,000 is still a stretch for me.  I can offer $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",10000.0,Bob,6,
