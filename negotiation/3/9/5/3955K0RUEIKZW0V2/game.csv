"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe the product is a good one, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $1,025,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
