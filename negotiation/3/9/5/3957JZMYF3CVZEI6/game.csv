"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $12,000? I understand it's still higher than my initial assessment, but I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value you'll gain from it. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $17,000. I would like to propose $14,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
