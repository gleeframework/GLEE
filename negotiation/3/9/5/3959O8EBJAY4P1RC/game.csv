"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $14,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $16,000, which still gives you a great price on a valuable product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us and avoids the need to go through John.",15500.0,Bob,4,
