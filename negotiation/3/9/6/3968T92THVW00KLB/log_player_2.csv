"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you value it at $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to get a price higher than the product's worth to her, $1,400,000 is still less than your maximum price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
