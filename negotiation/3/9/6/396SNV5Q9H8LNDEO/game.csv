"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product is worth a lot more, and to be fair to both of us, I could let it go for $13,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this quality.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
