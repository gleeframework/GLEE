Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $20,000, you gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually beneficial price.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net in John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a price below your minimum."
