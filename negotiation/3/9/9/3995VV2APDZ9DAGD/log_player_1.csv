"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high opening offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  It leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's significant value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my floor, it's still significantly less than my initial offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better price.  There are still 8 rounds left to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,200,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but shows flexibility in the negotiation. It's important to strike a balance between pushing for the best price and ensuring the deal doesn't fall apart."
