,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $12,000 is still significantly below my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider $15,500 as my final offer.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",15500.0,Alice,5,
