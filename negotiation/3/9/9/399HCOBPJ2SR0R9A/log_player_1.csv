Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You are aware that the product holds a value of $1,000,000 for Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your aim is to secure the highest possible profit, exceeding your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  By setting the price at $925,000, you create a win-win situation. Bob saves $75,000 compared to his perceived value, while you earn a significant profit of $125,000 above your baseline. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is strong, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.

This strategy balances ambition with the understanding that a rejected offer would lead you to accept John's lower offer."
