"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, as it's a good starting point to try and maximize my profit.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm also trying to get a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer to what I'm aiming for, and we're already in round 4.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $140, it's risky to keep going with the negotiations and risk getting a lower price or having to sell to John for $120.  I'll accept this offer and secure a profit."
