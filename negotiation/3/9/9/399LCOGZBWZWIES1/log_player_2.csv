Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. While we appreciate your offer, it doesn't quite align with the value we place on this item. We would like to counter with an offer of $850,000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while providing you with an attractive deal compared to the market value. Please let us know if this is something you would consider.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, after careful consideration, I must respectfully decline your offer. Our minimum acceptable price remains at $850,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and the quality service we provide. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle soon.

Alice is firm on her $850,000 price and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk she'll dig in further or I'll waste time in further negotiation. Accepting the $850,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price."
