"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still above my maximum value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $8,500. Considering your willingness to pay $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm willing to pay above my maximum value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you the product for $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
