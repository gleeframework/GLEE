"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable paying.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to go up to $725000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is as close to your target price as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and offer the product to you for $700000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,7,
