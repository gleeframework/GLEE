# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly valuable product. Given its unique potential and the benefits it offers, I'm confident it will be a fantastic investment for you. To kick off our conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds your current offer. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a willingness to meet closer to its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the $1,800,000 price point is still a significant leap from my initial offer.  To show I'm serious, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  I believe this demonstrates my interest while acknowledging the need for a price that aligns with my budget."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to make another move to keep the conversation going, but it needs to reflect the product's true worth. I can come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but her ""final offer"" of $1,500,000 is still considerably higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's unlikely she'll move closer to your price range if this is truly her final offer. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is a much better deal."
