"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds your current offer. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a willingness to meet closer to its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the $1,800,000 price point is still a significant leap from my initial offer.  To show I'm serious, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  I believe this demonstrates my interest while acknowledging the need for a price that aligns with my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to make another move to keep the conversation going, but it needs to reflect the product's true worth. I can come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
