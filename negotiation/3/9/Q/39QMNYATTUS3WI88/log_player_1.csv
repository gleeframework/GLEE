I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters and also allows me to see how much value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm countering with $1,500,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a further compromise, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's not the ideal price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a lower offer or ending up with no sale at all."
