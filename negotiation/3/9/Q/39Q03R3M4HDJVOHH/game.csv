"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I recognize you see the value, $850,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875,000. Can you consider this price?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $875,000. How about we settle at $887,500? This reflects my desire to strike a deal while acknowledging your price considerations.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500. I'm willing to go up to $882,500, but that's my final offer. Can you consider this price?",882500.0,Bob,6,
