"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's offer. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option. There's no benefit to buying from Alice in this scenario."
