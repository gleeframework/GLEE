"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $750000 is significantly below what I consider to be a fair price.

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm open to finding common ground, $775000 is still too far below what I'm able to accept.  Let's aim for a more balanced compromise.

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, but $795000 is still a little lower than I can accept. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $805000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",805000.0,Alice,7,
