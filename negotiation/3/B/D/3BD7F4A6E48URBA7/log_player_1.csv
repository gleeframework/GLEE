Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation. It also gives me some wiggle room if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. It gives me a better price than his offer while showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value. John is offering my desired price, so it's the most profitable choice for me."
