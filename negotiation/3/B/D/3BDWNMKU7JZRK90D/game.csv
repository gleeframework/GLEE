"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I could get it from John for $8000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is simply not enough. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This gives you a great deal, and it's still a reasonable price for me.  Let's work towards a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500, which is a fair compromise.  This gives you a decent profit, and I get the product at a price that's within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this figure.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to go up to $9750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I could get it from John for $8000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $9750 still isn't quite there yet. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a fair compromise, and it keeps us both happy. It's a solid price for both of us, and it's time to close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
