"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm sure you'll appreciate its value. I'm asking for $8,500, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is asking for more.  It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
