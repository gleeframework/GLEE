"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that acknowledges the value this product brings. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me.  I understand the product's value, but I'm only able to go up to $1,050,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still not able to go higher than $1,050,000.  This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
