"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,000,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
