"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to around $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. I could meet you halfway and do $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
