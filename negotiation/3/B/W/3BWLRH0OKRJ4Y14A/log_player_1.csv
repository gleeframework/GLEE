"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, we're close to my desired amount and it's likely Bob won't go any higher. It's better to secure the deal than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out to John's offer."
