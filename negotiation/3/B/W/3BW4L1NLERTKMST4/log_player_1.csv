Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which is above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediately shutting down the deal.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on the benefits for both parties. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, I'm aiming to:

* **Start negotiations in a positive light:** This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting or making a counteroffer.
* **Secure a price closer to my desired value:** It's unlikely Bob will accept my initial offer, but it sets a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  By not offering my absolute minimum price right away, I can potentially reach a higher price during the negotiation process.

If Bob rejects the offer, I will need to assess his counteroffer and either accept it (if it's close enough to my desired price) or make a counteroffer of my own, aiming to inch closer to my target price. 

**Remember:** If the negotiation stalls or becomes unproductive, I can always walk away and sell the product to John for my minimum price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unattractive, it indicates that he's still interested in the product.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair deal and am willing to negotiate. 
* **Stay firm on my minimum:** I will not accept any offers below my minimum price, even if it means the deal falls through.

**Next Steps:**

I will formulate a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but still within a reasonable range. I will aim to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us, but I will not be afraid to walk away if the negotiation becomes unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but aiming to keep the negotiation going. I'm offering $1,000,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes that this price is a ""good deal for both of us."" This reinforces the idea of a win-win situation and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** By starting with a higher offer and gradually lowering it, I'm maintaining my leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Signal Flexibility:**  The counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Keep Options Open:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm prepared to make further adjustments. However, I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary. 

**Outcome:**

By offering a counteroffer that is reasonable and demonstrates a willingness to compromise, I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob that is beneficial for both parties.  However, if the negotiation stalls, I will not hesitate to move on to other buyers to ensure I get the best possible price for my product."
