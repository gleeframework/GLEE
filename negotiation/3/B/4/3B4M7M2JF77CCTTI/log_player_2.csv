"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially get closer to his $10,000 target."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10,500? I believe that's a fair price considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $10500 is still a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $10750? I'm confident this price will still provide you with a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is closer to Bob's target, he's still determined to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob another opportunity to counter with a lower price.  Since John is willing to sell for $10,000, Bob knows he can likely get a better price with further negotiations."
