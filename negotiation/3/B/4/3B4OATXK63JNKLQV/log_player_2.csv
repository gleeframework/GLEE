"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100.** This is less than your maximum budget of $120.
* **Buying from John would cost you $120.** 
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $20.** 

It's always better to get a lower price, even if it's only a small difference."
