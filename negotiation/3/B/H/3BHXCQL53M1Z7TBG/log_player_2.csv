"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what John is offering, it's still more than the product is worth to you. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is still a decent profit for Alice ($10 above her value) while being closer to my target price. This should be a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $150. While I would prefer a lower price, further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result, and I risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
