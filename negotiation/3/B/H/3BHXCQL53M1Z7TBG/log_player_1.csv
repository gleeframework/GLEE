Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value to him ($150) and my minimum acceptable price ($120).  This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $140.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired amount."
