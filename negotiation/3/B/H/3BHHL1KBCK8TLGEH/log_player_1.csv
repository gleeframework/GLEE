Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, but I'm open to discussing the price further. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($800,000). This sets a high anchor point for the negotiation and gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm stating I'm open to discussing the price, which signals flexibility and willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution. This might encourage Bob to counteroffer instead of immediately rejecting.
* **Knowing My Backup:** I'm aware of John's offer of $800,000, so I can confidently counter any offer lower than that.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. The strategy will need to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $800000 for the product?  I think it's a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation.  Accepting his offer ensures I receive my minimum value and avoids the uncertainty of further counteroffers."
