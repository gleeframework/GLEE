"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $150.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for her to make a profit. It's also a price you're comfortable paying, as it's within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $130 is still within your budget and represents a better deal than buying from John for $150.  It's also likely that further negotiation will only result in a small price reduction, and the risk of Alice walking away from the deal. Accepting her offer is the best course of action."
