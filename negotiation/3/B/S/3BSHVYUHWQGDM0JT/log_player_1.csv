""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000,  as I know it will benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum selling price ($8,000).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to his valuation ($11,000) maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While a high initial offer is good, it leaves a slight buffer for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

By offering the product at $11,000, you strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
