"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I have another offer for $1,000,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a reasonable cost. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and the other offer I have. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with the other option. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous offer, and I'm not willing to give up more. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the other offer I have.
