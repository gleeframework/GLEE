I'm offering $700,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within my budget. I'm hoping this will entice Alice to negotiate further."

While I'd love to continue negotiating, Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good deal considering my budget and the risk of losing the product to John.  I'll accept the offer and move forward with the purchase."
