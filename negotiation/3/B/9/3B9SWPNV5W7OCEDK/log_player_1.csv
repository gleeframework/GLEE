Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,012,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth with Bob, and while we're getting closer, it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm not comfortable accepting $990,000, and I don't think I can get a higher price out of Bob.  I'm going to take the safe route and sell to John for $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed deal, and it's the closest I can get to my target price without risking a further negotiation with Bob."
