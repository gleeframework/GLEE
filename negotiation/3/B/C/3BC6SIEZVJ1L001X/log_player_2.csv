Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and I'm willing to negotiate. However, given the value and uniqueness of this product, I cannot go below $11,000. Would you be interested in proceeding with this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stood firm at $11,000. Bob has two choices:

* **Accept:**  Buy the product for $11,000, which is within his budget and a good deal compared to John's price.
* **Reject:** Risk further negotiation, potentially leading to a stalemate or a price increase from Alice, making John's offer more attractive.

Considering the risk of a further negotiation, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
