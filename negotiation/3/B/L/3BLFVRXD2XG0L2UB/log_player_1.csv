Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident that the product is worth more to Bob than $800,000 (my minimum), so there's a good chance he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still above my minimum and hopefully closer to what Bob is willing to pay. I'm aiming for a middle ground that might entice him to accept."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is just above my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value of the product and accept. I'm willing to go this low, but if he rejects again, I'll sell to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob has reached my minimum price, but I'm not going to risk going lower and potentially ending up with nothing. John is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him."
