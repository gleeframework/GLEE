"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8200. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I value your product, $8200 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now. Let's try $7800. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7800. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $8100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $8100. Let's split the difference and go with $7950. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to come to an agreement.",7950.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7950. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $8050. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8050.0,Alice,7,
