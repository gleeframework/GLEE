Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you.,110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 85. How about we meet in the middle at 100? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $92.50? I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to 92.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be 105. It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,
