"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my maximum price, and I believe it reflects the fair market value given its value to me.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your maximum price is $1,000,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
