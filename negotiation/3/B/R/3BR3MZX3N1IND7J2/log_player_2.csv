"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob is better off rejecting and counteroffering again to see if he can get closer to his desired price point.  He can also consider the potential risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and having to buy from John at a higher price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your maximum price is $1,000,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at the higher price anyway.  Buying from John now ensures Bob gets the product at his maximum budget and avoids further negotiation."
