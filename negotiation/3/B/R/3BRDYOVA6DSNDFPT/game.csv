"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $850,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we try $750,000? I'm serious about making this work.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can do $825,000, which is a bit higher than your latest offer, but still a significant discount from my original price. I'm confident this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could potentially go up to $780,000. This is a fair offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is a slight adjustment from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",795000.0,Alice,7,
