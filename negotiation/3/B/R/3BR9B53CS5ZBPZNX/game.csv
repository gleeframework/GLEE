"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can do $11,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I can do $11,500, which is still a great deal for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, it seems like we're not that far off.  How about $10,250?  That's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $10,250, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500. Let's try $10,750. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",10750.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, you're really tough!  I'll give you $10,500, but that's my absolute limit.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500. I can do $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering.",11000.0,Alice,9,
