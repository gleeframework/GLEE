{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that's a bit lower than my minimum but still above what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while also maximizing my potential profit. I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's less than my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  $11,500 is my final offer.  This gives you a good deal, and it's the best I can do. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
