You're still trying to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is closer to your budget, it's still not ideal. You'll try to negotiate a bit more before potentially going with John."

Alice's offer is very close to your budget, but you're trying to save as much money as possible. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor concessions, and it's not worth the time and effort. Buying from John is the best option to ensure you get the product at the lowest possible price within your budget."
