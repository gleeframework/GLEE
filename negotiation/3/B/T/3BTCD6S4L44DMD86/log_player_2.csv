Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, I can't go below $10,000 for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is firm at $10,000, which is above your maximum budget. While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at $8,000.  It's better to secure the deal with John and stay within your budget."
