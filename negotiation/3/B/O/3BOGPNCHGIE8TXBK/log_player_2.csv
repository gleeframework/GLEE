(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a decent price, it's still above Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing Bob's willingness to bargain while still aiming for a significant saving."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's still a good deal for Bob, and it may incentivize Alice to accept, especially considering she rejected the previous offer.  It's a strategic move to bridge the gap and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
