Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit. Bob knows the product is worth a lot to him, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate from this starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $1,200,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $1,350,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but it's still a good price for me and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, we're getting close to my minimum and it's better to secure a good deal than risk losing the sale to another buyer."
