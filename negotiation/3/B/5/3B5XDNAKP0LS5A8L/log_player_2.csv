Round 5
Alice's offer:

**Explanation:**

Alice is not budging significantly on her price. She went up from $11,000 to $11,500, indicating she might not be willing to go much lower. Given that you have the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
