"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but I'm still holding out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum price of $150, I'm still going to reject it. I'm hoping I can get him to go a bit higher, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option if I don't manage to close a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm counteroffering with $145. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my minimum. I'm hoping this will finally be enough to secure a deal, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $142 is only $8 away from my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. The negotiation has been very slow, and I'm afraid Bob may be trying to wear me down. I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial goal with one more counteroffer. If that doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 144}
```

I'm counteroffering with $144. This is only $2 above Bob's last offer, and I'm hoping it will be enough to finally reach a deal. I'm also aware that I'm running out of rounds, so I need to decide quickly. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely sell to John to avoid losing any more time."
