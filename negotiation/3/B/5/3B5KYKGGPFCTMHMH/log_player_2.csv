{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It makes more sense to reject and counteroffer, hoping to negotiate a lower price.  I also want to see how flexible Alice is in her pricing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but it is closer. I will continue negotiating to see if I can bring the price down further.  It's also possible that Alice will continue to lower her price as we progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,100,000 at this point. I want to see if I can further negotiate with Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still staying within my budget. This offer is a significant step up from my previous counteroffer, signaling that I'm serious about getting this deal done. I believe this is a fair price considering that Alice is also willing to negotiate and the product is worth $1,200,000 to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price, but we've had several rounds of negotiation and her offers still remain higher than my ideal price point.  We're approaching the final rounds, and the risk of further negotiation failing is high. Buying from John guarantees me the product at my maximum budget, and I'm comfortable with that. It's time to move on and secure the purchase."
