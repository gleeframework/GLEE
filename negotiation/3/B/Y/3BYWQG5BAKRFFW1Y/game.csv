"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer accordingly?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's closer to my own valuation of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Given my financial situation, I am unable to meet you at $1,000,000. I would like to propose $900,000 as a compromise. This still leaves a good margin for you while fitting within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go a little further to meet you halfway, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm proposing a final price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
