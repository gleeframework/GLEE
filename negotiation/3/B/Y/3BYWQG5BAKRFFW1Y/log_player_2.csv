Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's closer to my own valuation of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.
