{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and appealing to Bob's potential for profit. 
* **Plan:** I'm prepared to lower my price a bit more if necessary, but I'll always keep my minimum acceptable price in mind. If Bob is unreasonable, I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean losing a significant amount of money. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's closer to my own valuation of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the potential profit for Bob while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strategy:** I'm hoping to reach a middle ground with Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating or to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Given my financial situation, I am unable to meet you at $1,000,000. I would like to propose $900,000 as a compromise. This still leaves a good margin for you while fitting within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. 

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a compromise that is more favorable to me.  However, I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go a little further to meet you halfway, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm proposing a final price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising the price slightly, but still keeping it below my desired price, showing my commitment to reaching an agreement. 
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and compromise, while also making it clear that this is my final offer.
* **Strategy:**  I'm hoping to tempt Bob into accepting my offer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if he rejects it.  I'm confident that $950,000 is a good price that both parties can live with."
