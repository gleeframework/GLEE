"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,750?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,5,
