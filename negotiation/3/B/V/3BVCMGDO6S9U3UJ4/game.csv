"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is well outside my budget. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,000,000. This reflects a considerable reduction on my initial offer and keeps it within a reasonable range of its true value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,000,000 remains a significant stretch for my budget.  To make progress, I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  While your offer is closer to what I have in mind, we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This price reflects the significant value the product offers and represents a substantial compromise on my part.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $925,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in this product.  I'm eager to finalize the deal, so I hope we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,6,
