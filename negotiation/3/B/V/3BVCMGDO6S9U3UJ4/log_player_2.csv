"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's significantly above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is well outside my budget. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A counteroffer of $700,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the investment you're willing to make. This shows you're not just throwing out a random number.
* **Opening the negotiation:** It's important to start the negotiation strong, but not too aggressively.  This offer allows for potential compromise and leaves room for multiple rounds of back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,000,000. This reflects a considerable reduction on my initial offer and keeps it within a reasonable range of its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me a chance to get a better price. I'll need to find a way to bridge the gap between our offers, but I'm not willing to accept a price that's outside my financial limits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,000,000 remains a significant stretch for my budget.  To make progress, I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  A $50,000 increase from the previous offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget limits.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Highlighting the value you see in the product reinforces your commitment to the deal and provides a reason for your offer.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  Emphasize the compromise you're making to encourage Alice to move closer to your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  While your offer is closer to what I have in mind, we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This price reflects the significant value the product offers and represents a substantial compromise on my part. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. While it shows she's willing to negotiate,  it's not yet within my reach. I need to keep pushing for a lower price, and I believe there's still room for compromise.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $925,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in this product.  I'm eager to finalize the deal, so I hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  A $125,000 increase from the previous offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise without exceeding my budget.
* **Reiterate Investment:**  Highlighting the significant investment further solidifies your commitment to the deal.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""eager to finalize the deal"") can encourage Alice to accept your offer."
