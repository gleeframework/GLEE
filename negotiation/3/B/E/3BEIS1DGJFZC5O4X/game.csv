"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to purchase the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount from its true value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm offering it to you for $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate after my previous concession. However, I'm not willing to budge further. I'm going to make one last offer that I think is fair considering the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,9,
