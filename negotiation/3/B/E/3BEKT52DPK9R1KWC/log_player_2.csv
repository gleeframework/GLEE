"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* While buying from John for $1,500,000 is your absolute limit, it's not an ideal outcome.
* By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. She might be willing to lower it further to avoid losing the sale."
