"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal, and it's the highest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to compromise.  While I'm willing to go a bit higher, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $980,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not convinced it's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,020,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
