(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

You can do better than $95. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

You're still closer to your goal of $85.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and try to get closer to your desired price."
