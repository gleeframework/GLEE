Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood that Bob accepts. 

* **Why $1,150,000?** This price is  $150,000 more than you'd get from John, which is a significant profit boost. It also leaves $50,000 of potential value for Bob, giving him a good reason to accept the offer.
* **Why not go higher?**  While you could potentially get closer to $1,200,000, there's a higher risk Bob might reject the offer.  $1,150,000 provides a strong incentive for him to buy while still ensuring a good outcome for you."
