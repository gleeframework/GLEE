{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000.  While it's worth a great deal more to me, I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us.  Consider the potential benefits this product can bring you - it's a significant investment with a strong return on value. Let me know your decision, and we can finalize the details. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000 but still leaves a healthy profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and framing the offer as a mutually beneficial opportunity. This increases the chances of acceptance while still maintaining my bargaining position. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering a lower price increases the chance of Bob accepting, but it also lowers my potential profit. However, the risk is mitigated by the fact that I have a guaranteed fallback option with John.
* **Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters with a lower price, I can still potentially come to a deal that's advantageous for me."
