Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob accepts. Here's why:

* **My Profit:**  I'm aiming for a profit of $250,000, which is significantly more than I would get from John.
* **Bob's Incentive:** Bob gets a $50,000 discount from his perceived value, making the offer attractive. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** While there's a chance Bob could reject, the offer is still high enough to make it tempting for him. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John."
