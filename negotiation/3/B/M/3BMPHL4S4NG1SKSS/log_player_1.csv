Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional product. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. My starting price is $1,500,000.  Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $1200000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a decent starting point, I believe the product is worth more.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer in hopes of finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this unique product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1400000 is still a bit steep for me, but I'm getting closer. How about $1300000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a chance to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure with the limited number of rounds left, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer to try to find a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to continue exploring a mutually beneficial agreement.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I still believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price. I'm prepared to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's unique qualities, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
