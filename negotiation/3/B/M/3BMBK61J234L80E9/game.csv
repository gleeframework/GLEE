"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $8,800 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $9,000.  This price still represents a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my counteroffer and coming down to $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8900.0,Bob,4,
