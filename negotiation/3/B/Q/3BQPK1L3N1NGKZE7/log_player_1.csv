"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), you anchor the negotiation at a higher point. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""unique potential"" and ""true worth"" reinforces the value of the product without explicitly stating reasons Bob might disagree with.
* **Open to Discussion:**  While starting high, you also signal flexibility and willingness to find a solution that works for both parties. 
 
This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** Even if Bob counters significantly lower, you're still in a strong position to negotiate upwards from a high starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). You have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John guarantees your minimum, but there's potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the development and inherent value of this product  justify a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** You acknowledge his offer and perspective to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Justification:** You provide a brief, non-specific justification for the higher price without revealing your hand (""development and inherent value"").
* **Significant Drop:** You make a substantial drop from your initial offer ($2,300,000 to $1,900,000) to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Above Minimum:** Crucially, you remain well above your absolute minimum price ($1,500,000), leaving room for further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Encourage Movement:** By showing a willingness to move from your initial position, you encourage Bob to do the same.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:** You are still aiming for a price that is significantly higher than Bob's offer and well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $1,600,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to pay that amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could drag on, potentially leading to a less favorable outcome. 

Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above your minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
