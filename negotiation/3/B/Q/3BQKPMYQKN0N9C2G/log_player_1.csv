Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price that considers its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
