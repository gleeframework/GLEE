"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John ($1,200,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to John and secure the product at your desired price point."
