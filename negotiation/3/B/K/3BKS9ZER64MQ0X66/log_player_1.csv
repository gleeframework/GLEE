Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs at least $1,200,000 from the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 if Bob refuses.

**Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price, she should aim to get as much from Bob as possible, even if it means Bob might reject the offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I finalize a deal with another buyer.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Price:**  The offer price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, maximizing potential profit for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Slight Discount:**  Offering a small discount from John's price might make Bob feel like he's getting a somewhat better deal, even if it's above his initial valuation.

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might surprise Alice and accept the high price. Even if he rejects it, Alice hasn't lost anything, as she can proceed with her guaranteed sale to John."
