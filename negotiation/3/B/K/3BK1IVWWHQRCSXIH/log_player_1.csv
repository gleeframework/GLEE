"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, aiming to gauge Bob's initial interest and potentially secure a high price. It also leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $800,000.  It's too risky to accept this low offer, as I might be able to get a better price through further negotiation. I will reject his offer and attempt to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold of $800,000. I believe this price is reasonable and might entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable settling for less than $800,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject his offer and continue to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is just $50,000 above my minimum threshold. I believe this price is fair and attractive to Bob, potentially leading to a successful deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $820,000 is finally above my minimum threshold of $800,000, and it's getting closer to the price I'd like to get. There are only 4 rounds left, so it's time to accept this offer and close the deal. The risk of rejecting this offer and potentially not finding a better price within the remaining rounds is too high."
