"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. ",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $140.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've got to make a profit, and $140 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $155. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
