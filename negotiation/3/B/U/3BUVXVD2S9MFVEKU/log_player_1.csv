Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts with a significant markup from your minimum price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start negotiations.  It's a good starting point for a potential bargain, but remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting his offer gives you the chance to see if you can get closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 
This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial ask and Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and it's unlikely he will go higher.  At this point, selling to John for $15,000 is the most sensible option.  It ensures you get your minimum price and avoids further negotiations."
