"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that high.  $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and I pay $11000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $11000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11250.  This would be a fair compromise and a good value for you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
