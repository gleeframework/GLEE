Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that high.  $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and I pay $11000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
