"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the value you see in it. However, my budget is limited, and I am looking for a price closer to $800000. I would like to make a counteroffer at this amount. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
