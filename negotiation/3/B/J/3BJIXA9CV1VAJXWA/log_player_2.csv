"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still a significant amount of money, and there's a good chance Bob can negotiate a lower price.  He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so he has room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer.  He's offering $750,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $900,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal. This leaves room for further negotiation while still leaving Alice a profit margin.  It also sets the tone for the rest of the negotiation, putting pressure on Alice to accept a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $850,000 is closer to his ideal price, he still has room for negotiation. There are more rounds to go, and Bob can likely get the price down further.  He also has the option of buying from John as a backup, which gives him negotiating leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering $800,000, which is Alice's minimum acceptable price. This is a strategic move because it shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway, but also highlights the value of the product to both of them. There's a good chance Alice will accept this offer, as it ensures her desired profit margin. If she rejects it, it becomes clear she's looking for a higher price than what's reasonable, giving Bob more leverage in the next round."
