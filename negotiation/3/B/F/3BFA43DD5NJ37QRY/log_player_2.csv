"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is going to start by making a very low counteroffer. He knows this is unlikely to be accepted, but it sets a clear starting point for negotiation and shows Alice he is serious about getting a good deal.  $10,000 is Bob's absolute maximum, so he's not willing to go higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob should keep pushing for a lower price. There's no need to rush into a deal that still isn't within his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now increasing his offer, showing willingness to compromise while staying within his budget.  $12,000 is a middle ground, and there's a good chance Alice might be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

$14,500 is still too high for Bob. While it's tempting to close the deal, it's worth trying to negotiate a bit lower.  There are still rounds to go, and Bob can potentially get closer to his goal of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again making a small increase in his offer, showing continued willingness to compromise while still keeping his budget in mind.  $13,000 is a reasonable middle ground, and there's a good chance Alice might be willing to accept at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The negotiation has gone on for a while, and Alice is not budging much.  Bob has three rounds left, and while there's a slight chance he could get a better deal with Alice, it's risky to keep negotiating.  It's safer to buy from John at $10,000, which is Bob's maximum budget and guarantees a successful purchase."
