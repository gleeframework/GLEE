Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts the $19,000 offer, you've made a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always lower the price slightly in a subsequent attempt to still secure a deal with him before going to John."
