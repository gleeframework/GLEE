It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500.  At this point, the potential savings of a few hundred dollars by continuing to haggle aren't worth the risk of Alice raising her price or the time invested in further negotiations. It's more efficient to accept John's offer of $15,000 and move on."
