Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for John:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I have the chance to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **John is a backup:** Even if the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 sale with John, so I can afford to be patient and try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $600,000 is far below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant drop from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a profitable price for me. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds, justifying my higher price.
* **Setting a clear next step:** I'm giving Bob a clear decision to make, making the negotiation process more efficient."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a substantial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Counteroffer opportunity:** I still have the option to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I can continue to negotiate with Bob without losing out on a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This would allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a price you'd be happy with, given the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly in between my previous counteroffer ($950,000) and Bob's current offer ($700,000). This shows a strong willingness to compromise and meet in the middle.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reiterating that this price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, subtly emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Creating urgency:**  By proposing a ""final"" offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
