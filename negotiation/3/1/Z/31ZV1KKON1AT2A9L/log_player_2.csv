"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than the $150 you'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation. You want to try to get the price down closer to your $150 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $120. This shows my willingness to negotiate while still remaining within my budget. I believe this offer is fair considering the product is worth $80 to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still within my budget and closer to my ideal price than John's offer of $150.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or me losing time and potentially missing out on the product altogether outweighs the potential savings."
