"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is around $7,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $7,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,250?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,250 is still a little higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,000?  That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
