"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $9,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9100.0,Alice,5,
