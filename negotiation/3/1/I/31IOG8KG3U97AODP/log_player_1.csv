{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a significant profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting a good deal while keeping the negotiation open.
* **It's a strong opening:**  The message is friendly and suggests a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to consider your offer.

Remember, this is just the start of the negotiation! Be prepared to adjust your price and counteroffers depending on Bob's responses."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $850,000 is still a good deal, it's not as good as I can potentially get. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
