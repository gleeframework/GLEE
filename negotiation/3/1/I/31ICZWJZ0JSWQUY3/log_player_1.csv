Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts, and we can take it from there."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can aim significantly higher. Starting high gives room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message doesn't just throw out a number. It emphasizes the ""significant value"" and ""true worth,"" subtly anchoring Bob's perception to a higher price point. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is positive and invites Bob to discuss. This leaves the door open for counter-offers, allowing Alice to potentially still secure a deal above her minimum.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, pushing Bob too aggressively risks him rejecting the offer outright. This strategy balances ambition with a degree of realism."
