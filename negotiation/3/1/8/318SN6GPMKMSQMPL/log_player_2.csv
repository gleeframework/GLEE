"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I can't quite do $110, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's my final offer.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some flexibility, her ""final offer"" of $125 is still a significant markup from John's price of $100.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and at this point, accepting John's offer ensures you get the product while staying within your budget."
