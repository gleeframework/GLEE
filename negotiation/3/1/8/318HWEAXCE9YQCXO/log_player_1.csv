{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I hope this will be a fair price that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $125 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my desired price. I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to sell to John for a lower price."
