"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny for you.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of the product for you. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $8,500 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. This is my final offer.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you need a fair price, and I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer.  How about we settle at $7,500? This seems like a reasonable compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 still doesn't cover my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is my final offer, and if we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $8,000. If you can meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand and wish you the best in finding another buyer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
