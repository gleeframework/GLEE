Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and it's worth trying to negotiate further. I can still get a better price from Bob than I can from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of the product for you. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $8,500 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you need a fair price, and I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer.  How about we settle at $7,500? This seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. I can get more from him or John, so I'll continue to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 still doesn't cover my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is my final offer, and if we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $8,000. If you can meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand and wish you the best in finding another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
