"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's a bit above my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, though. I'm proposing a price of $16,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",15750.0,Bob,4,
