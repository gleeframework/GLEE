"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. While I could try to negotiate him up, there's a risk he won't budge much higher than his current offer. Selling to John guarantees my desired profit.
