"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's try to find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? That's a very competitive price for what you're getting.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $14,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
