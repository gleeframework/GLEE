"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't accept a price that low. Let's meet in the middle – how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference – how about $962,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",962500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but that price is cutting it too close for me. I can go down to $999,000 – it's my final offer. This is a great deal on a product you won't regret owning.",999000.0,Alice,5,
