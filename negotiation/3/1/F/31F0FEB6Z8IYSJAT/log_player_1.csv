Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. There are still 9 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $1,500,000, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a good compromise. We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and it's not guaranteed that I'll be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a sale that's within a reasonable range of my minimum acceptable value."
