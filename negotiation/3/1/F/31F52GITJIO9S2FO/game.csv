"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,,
