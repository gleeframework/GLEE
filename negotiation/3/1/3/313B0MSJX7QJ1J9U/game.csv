"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, so I'm offering $1275000. Can you consider this price?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  $1275000 is getting more reasonable.  To make this work, I'll need to come down to $1300000.  This is my final offer for now, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
