"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly lower than its true value. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
