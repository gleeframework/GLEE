Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair outcome for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while ensuring I can move forward with the sale.
