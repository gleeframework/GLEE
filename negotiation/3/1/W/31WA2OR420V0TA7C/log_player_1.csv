Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is well above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appealing to Bob:** The message highlights the deal's value to Bob while also emphasizing my desire to get a good price. 
* **The Backup Plan:**  Having John as a backup at $1,500,000 provides a safety net and allows me to be more confident in my negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also want to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for such a loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find a compromise.
* **John's Offer:** Having John as a backup at $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair outcome for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintaining Value:** $1,100,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value, but it's a substantial drop from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message uses a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob break down. This provides leverage in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob has come up from his initial offer, $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling at this price would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Final Offer:** Bob's ""final offer"" statement is a tactic to pressure me. However, I'm not desperate for a sale and can rely on John's offer.
* **Potential for Compromise:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a deal closer to $1,000,000 or $1,050,000.
* **John's Offer:** My ability to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm and potentially reject Bob's final offer, knowing I have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $950,000.  However, that's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while ensuring I can move forward with the sale.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's latest offer ($950,000). This shows a willingness to meet in the middle and reach an agreement.
* **Maintain Value:** $1,025,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value, but it's a considerable drop from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Finality:** While I'm willing to negotiate further, I'm implying that this is my final offer, putting the pressure back on Bob to decide.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still holding onto John's offer as my safety net. This gives me confidence to push for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our desired prices and create an opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement."
