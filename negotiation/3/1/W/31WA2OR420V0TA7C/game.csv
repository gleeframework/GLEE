"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also want to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair outcome for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $950,000.  However, that's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while ensuring I can move forward with the sale.  Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
