"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay. He can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  There's a good chance Alice will negotiate down to meet Bob's budget or at least come closer to it."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you and is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering again.  There's a chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further, especially since she already made a concession."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has already made a significant concession, and Alice is showing a stubbornness to come down further.  While a few more rounds of negotiation are possible, there's a high chance this will continue to be a back-and-forth without much progress. Given that John is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than Alice's current offer, it's the most logical decision to buy from John."
