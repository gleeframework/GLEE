"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The price offered by Alice is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts by offering the maximum Bob is willing to pay. This puts pressure on Alice to either accept or come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's limit, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth seeing if Alice will negotiate further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice will come down even more, especially since she's already rejected two of Bob's offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise again, halfway between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and might be enough to get Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget and only slightly above his desired price. At this point, further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly lower price. It's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
