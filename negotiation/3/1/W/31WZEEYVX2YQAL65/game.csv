,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $140? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $165 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm happy to pay $155, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $160. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,5,
