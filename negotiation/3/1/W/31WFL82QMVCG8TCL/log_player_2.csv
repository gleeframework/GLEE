Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our product's value and your willingness to pay, I propose a price of $13,500 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests.

Bob should continue negotiating.  While $13,500 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to get it lower.  He has the option to buy from John for $12,000, which makes him a strong negotiator in this situation."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a common ground, Bob. In light of our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $13,250 for the product. I believe this offer is reasonable and takes into account both the product's value and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,250 is getting close to his limit, he can still try to get a better price.  He can buy from John for $12,000, giving him leverage in the negotiation. It's worth trying to get Alice to come down just a little more."
