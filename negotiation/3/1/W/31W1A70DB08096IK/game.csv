"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1500000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",1500000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to settle for that price. The product is worth significantly more to me than that. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering the product for $1600000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you will gain from it. Let's meet halfway.",1600000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1600000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1450000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",1450000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1450000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will deliver significant returns.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1550000, but I believe this is the lowest I can go while still getting fair value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,,
