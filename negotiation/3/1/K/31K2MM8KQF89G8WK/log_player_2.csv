Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I can offer it to you for $122, which is just a little above your latest offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.

It's not worth going back and forth with Alice anymore. She's unlikely to go below $120, and at this point, buying from John for $120 is the best way to guarantee getting the product without overpaying."
