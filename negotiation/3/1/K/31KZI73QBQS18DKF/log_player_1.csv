Bob's offer:

I understand your budget constraints, but the  $600,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,400,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to make one final offer of $750,000. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.

Explanation:  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's clear that the gap between his valuation and your minimum acceptable price is too large. Accepting his final offer would be a substantial loss compared to John's standing offer."
