"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider. This product is incredibly valuable, as we've discussed. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's still better than buying from John for $1,200,000 and is closer to my target price than my previous counteroffer.  It's time to close the deal."
