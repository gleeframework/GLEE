"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose a price of $11500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can agree on this price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13000, so I'd like to propose a price of $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12500. I can offer it to you for $14000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me at a price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12750, but no higher. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession already, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but that's the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at a price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last attempt to negotiate. I'll meet you at $13000, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",13000.0,Bob,10,
