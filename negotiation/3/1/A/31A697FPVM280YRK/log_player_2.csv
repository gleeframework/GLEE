# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it will bring to your business.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a better price from John, and there's a chance he can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value it will bring to your business.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay, and while he could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll get a better price from Alice. John is offering a price that Bob is comfortable with, so it's the best choice to buy from John."
