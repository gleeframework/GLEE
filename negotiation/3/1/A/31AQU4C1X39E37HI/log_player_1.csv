Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially get closer to the product's true value to Alice. 
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** We need to offer a price enticing enough for Bob to accept but high enough to maximize Alice's profit. The midpoint between Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and John's offer ($1,500,000) is $1,350,000. This starting point gives us room to negotiate if needed.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Power:** If Bob is aware of John's offer, he might be less likely to accept a price significantly higher than his perceived value. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If a quick sale is important, a slightly lower price might be strategic."
