"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can do better than $120.  It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

This offer is still within your budget and leaves some room for Alice to negotiate without losing too much.  It also shows that you're serious about buying the product, but are not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could continue to negotiate, Alice has come down to a price that is very close to your budget and still gives her a decent profit. Accepting the offer is the best choice to ensure you get the product without risking a further counteroffer from Alice or losing the opportunity to buy from John."
