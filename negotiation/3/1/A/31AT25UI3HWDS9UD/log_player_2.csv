I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This allows for negotiation and potentially a deal that benefits both of us.  It's also important to leave some room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to my maximum budget, there are still three rounds left. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if I can secure a slightly better price.  There's a good chance that Alice is willing to come down a little more.  It's better to try to get the best deal possible than to settle right away."
