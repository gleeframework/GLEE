"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob accepts, fantastic! I've secured a great price.
* **Set a high baseline:** If Bob rejects, he'll know I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I have a lot of room to lower the price if necessary without going below my minimum.

I'm willing to go through multiple rounds of negotiation with Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John at $1,000,000 if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this point.  

**My strategy is to:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to my initial price, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him I'm not desperate and am prepared to walk away if necessary.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me confidence to hold firm in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation.  

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to find a common ground.
* **Keeps pressure on Bob:**  It's still above my minimum, reminding him that I have other options.
* **Sets the stage for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have more room to maneuver in future rounds.

I'm monitoring the negotiation closely. If Bob continues to offer significantly lower prices, I'll consider selling to John in the next round to secure a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I'm still not willing to accept it.  

* **John is my backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000. This gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price.
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and the gap between our offers is shrinking.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially if he realizes I have other options.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $1,000,000, trying to find a middle ground. However, if Bob continues to offer significantly lower prices, I'll consider selling to John in the next round to secure my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway.  I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept, but still provides me with a comfortable profit. 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Keeps pressure on Bob:**  It's still above my minimum, reminding him that I have other options.
* **Sets the stage for a potential deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have less room to maneuver in future rounds, and may consider selling to John in the next round to secure my minimum acceptable price. 

I'm monitoring the negotiation closely and will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not quite there.  I'm not ready to accept it yet.

* **John is my backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000. This gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price.
* **Negotiation is progressing:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and the gap between our offers is shrinking.
* **We are close:** We are just $50,000 apart.  I believe there's a good chance we can reach an agreement in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price just slightly above $950,000, aiming for a final deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll strongly consider selling to John in the next round to secure my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $975,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing him I'm serious about reaching a deal but also that I'm not willing to go much lower. 

This counteroffer:

* **Signals a willingness to compromise:**  It shows Bob that I'm flexible and open to a quick agreement.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can still lower my offer slightly in the next round without sacrificing too much.
* **Creates pressure on Bob:**  Knowing that I have John as a backup buyer, Bob might be more inclined to accept this offer to avoid losing the deal.

This is my final counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John to secure my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $960,000. Here's why:

* **We're very close:**  We're only $40,000 apart.  There's a good chance I won't be able to get a better price, especially since we only have two rounds left.
* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds remaining, I risk losing a deal altogether.  
* **John is a backup:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I know I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.

This decision is a balance between maximizing my profits and minimizing my risk. While I'm not thrilled with the price, it's a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
