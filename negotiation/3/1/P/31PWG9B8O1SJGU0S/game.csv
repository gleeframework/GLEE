"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I understand the product is worth more to you, but I hope we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $15,000 and I'm willing to give you a discount to make the deal happen.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $12,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000, which would be $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering we are both willing to make concessions. ",11000.0,Bob,6,
