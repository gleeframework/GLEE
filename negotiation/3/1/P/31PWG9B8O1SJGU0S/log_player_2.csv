"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's not a good deal for you, and you should try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I understand the product is worth more to you, but I hope we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $15,000 and I'm willing to give you a discount to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to get closer to your target price. Rejecting the offer allows you to send a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $12,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000, which would be $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above your budget. While it's getting closer, it's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price. You still have 5 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering we are both willing to make concessions. "", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,000, which would be $12,200. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,200 is still above your budget of $10,000. While the negotiation is getting closer, you have limited rounds left, and it's unclear if you can convince Alice to go any lower. Given the risk of not reaching an agreement, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees you the product at your maximum budget."
