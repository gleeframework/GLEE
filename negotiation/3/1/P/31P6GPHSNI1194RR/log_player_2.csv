"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80."", ""product_price"": 80} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $80, I'm anchoring the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my $100 maximum.
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer will gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she immediately rejects it, I know I'll have to go higher. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have the option to go to John and pay $100 if Alice proves to be too inflexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice has come down considerably, $110 is still above my $100 limit.  There's a chance she might be willing to meet me in the middle with another round of negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious about getting a better price. She may be willing to go lower rather than lose the sale. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm still keeping John in mind. If Alice won't budge further, I can always get the product from him for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, how about we meet in the middle at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $95, I'm suggesting a compromise that puts us halfway between her last offer ($110) and my previous offer ($80). This shows a willingness to negotiate fairly.
* **Approaching My Limit:** This offer is very close to my $100 maximum. If Alice rejects it, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John.  
* **Final Push:** This is likely my last offer before considering John's deal. I'm hoping Alice will see it as a reasonable compromise to close the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure I can meet you in the middle, Bob. I've already come down quite a bit from my initial price. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached My Limit:** Alice is holding firm at $105, which is above my $100 maximum budget. It seems unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **John is the Safer Bet:** I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100. This ensures I stay within my budget. 
* **Avoiding Further Haggling:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice could be fruitless and time-consuming.  It's better to take the sure thing with John."
