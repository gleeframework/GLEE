"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a target price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000. This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair deal considering your minimum requirement and the value of the product to me. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway again. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
