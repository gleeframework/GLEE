"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, but still within a range that I think Bob might consider, given that he values the product at $100.  I'm also opening the negotiation with a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth around $140 for me. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 155} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's offer, but still below my minimum.  I'm also emphasizing the value for both of us, hoping to motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your position, but I would like to stick to my original assessment. I am willing to pay $145 for the product. Could we perhaps find common ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm willing to go down to $150, which is still a good price for a product that's worth $100 to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going down to my minimum price, but I'm still emphasizing the value for Bob and trying to close the deal."
