"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,400,000 is too high, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value you've mentioned, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow for a smooth transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While your offer is appealing, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,325,000 is a good price, considering his goal is to save money.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's risky and might lead to Alice walking away.  Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
