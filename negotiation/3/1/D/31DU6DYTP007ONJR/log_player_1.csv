Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly imply the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" suggests you're open to discussing the price, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer while still aiming for a higher profit. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Demand:** While you have John as a backup, a quicker sale to Bob might be more desirable. A slightly lower price could speed up the process.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer to avoid immediately discouraging him."
