I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. We're back to his initial offer.  It's tempting to take it, but I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a little more.  I'm getting close to my target price, and I think there's still room for negotiation."

It's getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I need to make a decision. Although I'd like to get closer to my target price, I think Bob's offer of $9,200 is a good compromise. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to bargain. I'm happy to accept his offer and move on."
