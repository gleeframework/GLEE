"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm prepared to offer $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. I'm offering $12,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I wouldn't want to miss out on the opportunity to purchase the product from you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
