Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is very close to your target price of $800,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's getting late in the game and the risk of her walking away or you having to buy from John increases.  It's a good deal overall, and you're still saving a significant amount of money compared to her initial offer."
