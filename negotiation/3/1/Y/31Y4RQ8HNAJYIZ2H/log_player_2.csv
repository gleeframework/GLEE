"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $160. I know it's worth $150 to you, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in it and be willing to pay a little extra.  If you're not interested, I can easily sell it to someone else for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to you. You know you can get it for $150 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or simply buy it from John at your target price."
