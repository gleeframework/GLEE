"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This price reflects its value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her product valuation. There's room for negotiation to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  We want to make a counteroffer that moves the price substantially in our favor. This starting point leaves room for further negotiation while signaling we're serious buyers.
* **Staying Below John:**  Our counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's ask but still comfortably below our maximum budget ($1,200,000) and John's offer.
* **Polite and Direct:** Maintaining a positive and professional tone is important in negotiations.  We acknowledge Alice's offer while clearly stating our position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm prepared to come down to $950,000. This leaves some room for profit for both of us and reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $950,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential savings on the table. We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer to that price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That seems fair for both of us."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:** We're acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate while continuing to move the price closer to our target. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This common negotiation tactic suggests a spirit of compromise and fairness.
* **Staying Strategic:** We're still a significant margin below John's price, maintaining our leverage."
