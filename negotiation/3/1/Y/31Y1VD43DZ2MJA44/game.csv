"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm prepared to come down to $950,000. This leaves some room for profit for both of us and reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer to that price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That seems fair for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
