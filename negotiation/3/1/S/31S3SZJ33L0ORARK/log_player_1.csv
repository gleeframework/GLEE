{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can gradually lower the price, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have limited information about Bob's financial capacity or willingness to pay. If you had more insights into Bob's situation, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
