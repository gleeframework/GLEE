"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $900,000.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has raised her offer, but it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. There is still room for negotiation as Alice's value is $800,000 and Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is being stubborn, and her offers are getting closer to Bob's maximum budget. If Bob keeps rejecting, there's a high chance that Alice will stick to her price or even increase it.  At this point, it's better for Bob to buy from John for $1,200,000 to ensure he gets the product. It's unlikely that further negotiation with Alice will yield a significantly better price."
