Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to counteroffer if he feels the price is too high. It also emphasizes the value he'll get from the product, making it more likely he'll consider the offer seriously."
