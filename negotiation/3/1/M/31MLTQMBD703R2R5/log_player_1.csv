Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $115."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $105 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle again? Can you do $107.50?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $107.50 is closer to my goal, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer! How about we compromise and go with $109?  That's only a dollar away from your last offer and gets us a bit closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $109. How about we try to get a bit closer to my original target of $105? Can you do $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally get closer to $110, I've already rejected his offer twice and we're down to our last few rounds. Accepting $108 is still a better deal than selling to John for $100."
