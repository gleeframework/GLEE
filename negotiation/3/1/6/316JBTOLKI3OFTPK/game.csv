"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
