,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the value I'm comfortable with. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. That's a good compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
