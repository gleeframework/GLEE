"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the value I'm comfortable with. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","While Bob's offer matches my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $15,000."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. That's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 is a solid deal. It exceeds my minimum and avoids the risk of negotiations breaking down."
