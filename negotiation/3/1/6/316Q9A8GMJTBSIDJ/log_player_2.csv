"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth more to Alice than it is to me. This suggests there is room for negotiation.  I will reject the offer and see if I can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high, but I'm getting closer to my budget.  I will reject this offer and make another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which reflects the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this price, I will have to purchase the product from John instead."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John, as I will save $250,000."
