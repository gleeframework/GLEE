"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which reflects the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this price, I will have to purchase the product from John instead.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
