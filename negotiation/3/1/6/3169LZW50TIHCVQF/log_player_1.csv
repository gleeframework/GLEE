I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Even though Bob has come up with a price that is very close to my desired price, I have only two rounds left. There is not enough time to negotiate any further, and I'm running the risk of not getting a better offer than John's. Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
