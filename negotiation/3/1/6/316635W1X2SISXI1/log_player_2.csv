"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. We can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Fair:**  We start with an ambitious counteroffer close to Alice's value ($80). While there's a chance Alice accepts immediately, it's more likely to start a negotiation.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed positively to keep the conversation amicable and encourage Alice to continue bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground to see if we can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I'm getting closer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $85?"",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $85, we're splitting the difference between our last offer ($80) and her counteroffer ($90). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is straightforward and emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $87 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $87 is a reasonable price, well below our $120 maximum and significantly lower than John's offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are over halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Continuing to push for a slightly lower price might risk Alice walking away or running out of time. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling might only yield a few dollars difference at this point. It's often better to secure a good deal rather than risk losing it for a small potential gain."
