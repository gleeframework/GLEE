"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not comfortable meeting you at $12000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $16000. This is a compromise that I believe is more in line with the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $14000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $16500. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not meeting in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's my absolute limit. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $13500. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $17000. This is a price that I believe is fair, considering the product's value and the previous offers we've discussed. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",17000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, Alice. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll meet you at $14000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",14000.0,Bob,8,
