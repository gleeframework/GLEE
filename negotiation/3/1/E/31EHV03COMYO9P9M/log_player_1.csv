Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob in the message, hoping to encourage him to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, which is my minimum, giving me the confidence to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay $11000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation and potentially a higher offer from Bob. 
* **Protecting my Value:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, but I want to see if I can do better.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that this deal would be ""good"" for both of us, creating a win-win scenario.
* **Maintain Pressure:**  I'm still not accepting Bob's offer, subtly reminding him that I'm not desperate for a sale and have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your prompt response. I understand your position, but based on my financial constraints, I am unable to go beyond $11000. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has firmly stated his maximum price of $11,000, which is still below my minimum desired profit. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation could lead to more back and forth without a guarantee of a higher offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I receive a profit that meets my minimum requirements.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward.  It's more efficient to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
