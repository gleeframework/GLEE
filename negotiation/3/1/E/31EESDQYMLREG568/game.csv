"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $180 is a bit too high for me. How about $140?  I'm really keen on this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $155. Let's split the difference and make this deal!",155.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're willing to go up to $155, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. How about we meet at $165?",165.0,Alice,5,
