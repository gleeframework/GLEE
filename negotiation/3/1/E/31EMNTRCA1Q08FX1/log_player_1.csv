Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer.  This allows you to aim high with Bob, knowing you have a fallback option. The key is to propose a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to your operations."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for him to perceive value.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not explicitly mentioning John, there's an implicit sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.

**Outcome Scenarios**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a $150,000 profit compared to your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters, but always hold firm above your $1,000,000 minimum."
