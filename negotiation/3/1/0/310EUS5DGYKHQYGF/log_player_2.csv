"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially save even more by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to recoup a significant portion of my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his budget. While $11,000 is better than $11,500, he can potentially still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's still room for Alice to come down further, and Bob doesn't want to miss out on the possibility of getting the product for $10,500 or even closer to his $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to go down to $11250. This is a final offer on my side. Let's close this deal and I promise you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob is determined to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible. By rejecting the offer, he keeps the negotiation going, potentially allowing him to get a better deal or even close the deal with John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,750. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10750}
