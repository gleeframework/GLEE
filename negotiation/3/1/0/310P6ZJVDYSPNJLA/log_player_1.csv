"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's currently priced at $950,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  Selling to John right now would be giving up potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Let's meet in the middle at $875000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I believe I can still get a better offer from Bob.  Selling to John now would be giving up potential profit. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to go down to $890,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $890000 is getting close to where I need to be. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $880000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. With only 4 rounds left, it's a good idea to take this offer and secure the deal.  There's a chance Bob might not budge further, and I risk losing the deal."
