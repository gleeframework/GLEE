Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it to you at a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, getting a sale from Bob is still preferable. This allows us to potentially make a profit beyond the guaranteed $1,500,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $750,000 is a strategic move. It's significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) but considerably higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The message is phrased to encourage a dialogue. If Bob counters, we have room to negotiate upwards, potentially reaching a price closer to his $800,000 valuation.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, since we have John as a guaranteed buyer, we are not at risk of losing the minimum price we are willing to accept."
