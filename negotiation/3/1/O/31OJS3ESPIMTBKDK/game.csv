,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 significantly undervalues the product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen.  $9,500 is still quite low,  but I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
