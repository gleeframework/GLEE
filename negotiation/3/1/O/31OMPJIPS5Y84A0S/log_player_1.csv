This offer gives me a healthy margin while still remaining potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, but also allows me to quickly pivot to John if Bob isn't interested."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic drop in price.  I'll counter with a higher price to try and find a middle ground."

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
