"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is within your budget, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get you closer to your ideal price point."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
