,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
