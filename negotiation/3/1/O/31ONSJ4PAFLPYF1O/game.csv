"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming back with a price. While I understand your perspective, $80 is quite a bit lower than I can go. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $130 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $95? That's a fair bit closer to your price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've already come down quite a bit, and to be honest, $95 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I could consider $115, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal too. How about we split the difference and settle at $105? That's my final offer.",105.0,Bob,6,
