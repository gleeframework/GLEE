"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 160
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:**  A high initial offer signals I'm willing to negotiate, making a potential deal more appealing to Bob.
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping John's offer in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable, I can always walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below both my minimum and my initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's willingness to counter suggests he's interested. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **John as backup:** It's still early in the negotiation. While John's offer is appealing, I believe I can get a better deal from Bob with some more back and forth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming back with a price. While I understand your perspective, $80 is quite a bit lower than I can go. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $130?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've significantly reduced my price from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Targeting Above My Minimum:**  The $130 counteroffer still keeps me comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, which could undervalue the product and make Bob question its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $130 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $95? That's a fair bit closer to your price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, $95 remains below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:**  By continuing to reject offers below my threshold, I'm signaling the seriousness of my valuation. Bob might be willing to go higher.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If Bob doesn't make a significant jump in the next round or two, I'll take John's guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've already come down quite a bit, and to be honest, $95 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I could consider $115, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  I'm making one last significant concession to try and secure a deal with Bob. 
* **Just Above Minimum:** $115 is only $5 above my absolute minimum, emphasizing that I'm nearing my limit. 
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by highlighting that this is a major compromise. This might encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I'm mentally prepared to walk away from the negotiation if Bob doesn't meet my price this round. John's offer ensures I don't leave empty-handed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal too. How about we split the difference and settle at $105? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Deal:**  $105 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my absolute minimum of $120, and significantly better than Bob's earlier offers.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's use of ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small gain ($15 more if I hold out for John's offer) might not be worth the extra time and effort. Accepting now guarantees a good profit."
