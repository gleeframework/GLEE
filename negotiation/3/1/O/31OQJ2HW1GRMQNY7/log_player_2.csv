"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic price considering its value. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should try to negotiate a better price.  There's no need to rush into a deal with Alice when John is offering a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000.  There's room for further negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there's still room for both parties to compromise.  Bob can continue to push for a lower price, as Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $960,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 960000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $960,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to come down to $965,000 as a final offer.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $965,000,  it's still above Bob's desired price point. At this point, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  John's offer of $800,000 is a much better deal for Bob, and it's time to take that option.  There's a risk that if Bob rejects Alice's offer, Alice might not be willing to negotiate further, and he might end up not getting the product at all."
