"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's above your maximum budget and significantly above the value you place on the product.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This establishes a clear boundary and signals to Alice that I'm serious about negotiating.  While there's a chance Alice might reject this offer, it's a strong starting point to see if there's any room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget and beyond the value I place on the product.  I will continue to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $900,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still sticking to a price that is within my budget and closer to the value I see in the product. Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than previous offers, it's still way above my maximum budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get a better price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,000,000. This shows Alice I'm committed to negotiating but also highlights the limitations of my budget.  It's a compromise, but still a significant amount lower than Alice's offer.  If Alice is serious about selling, I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,600,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price. If I can't, I'll likely buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,100,000. I'm getting closer to Alice's offer but still staying within my budget. The negotiation is getting more challenging, and this offer reflects my commitment to finding a compromise. If Alice rejects this offer, I might be forced to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, the time for negotiation is running out. While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm not confident I can get her to drop the price further in one round. 

Therefore, it's more prudent to secure the product from John at $800,000. This guarantees I acquire the product within my budget and ensures I don't risk losing the opportunity entirely."
