Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $10,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential $2,000 profit margin to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $12,000 risks Bob rejecting the deal. Aim for a price that gives you a significant portion of the profit margin while still being enticing to Bob.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique features, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is positive, emphasizes value to Bob, and frames the price as carefully considered.
* **Price:** $11,500 secures you $1,500 above your minimum and leaves Bob with a $500 perceived gain compared to his maximum valuation.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to slightly adjust your price to reach a mutually agreeable deal, but always keeping your $10,000 minimum in mind."
