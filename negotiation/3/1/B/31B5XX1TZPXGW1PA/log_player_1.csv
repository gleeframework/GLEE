"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $15,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high price will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it, we know he's looking for a significantly lower price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the security of John's offer ($12,000), so we're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Could we work towards a mutually beneficial price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Willingness:** Bob's counteroffer, while significantly lower than our initial ask, demonstrates his willingness to negotiate. This is a positive sign.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a substantial gap between his offer ($10,000) and both our desired price ($12,000) and our opening offer ($15,000). This leaves ample room for negotiation.
* **John as a Backstop:** We still have the security of John's offer. We are not in a desperate position to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We are moving closer to Bob's price range but still staying above our minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, we reinforce our position without being overly aggressive.
* **Encouraging a Counter:**  Offering a price point closer to the middle ground encourages Bob to continue negotiating and potentially increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I believe we can still find a fair price. I would like to propose $12,000 as the purchase price. Would you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Target:** Bob's offer of $12,000 matches our minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Need to Push Further:** While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's unlikely to be significant. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves time and effort that can be directed towards other potential sales or business activities."
