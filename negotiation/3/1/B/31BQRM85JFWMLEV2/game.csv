"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm ready to invest in this, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 right now. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000 to you. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm open to further negotiations. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us, and I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value I see in this product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a serious offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe that this product is worth more than that to you. After re-evaluating my options, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,025,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm open to further negotiations. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I value your time and the back-and-forth, but we're still a bit apart on price. I'm determined to make this work, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. To demonstrate my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This is my final offer, and I truly believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I believe this product is worth more than $975,000 to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm open to discussing the terms of the sale if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
