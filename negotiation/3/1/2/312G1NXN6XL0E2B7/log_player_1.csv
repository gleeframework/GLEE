Round 2

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to my minimum value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,750 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $9,000 for this to be worthwhile for me.  Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much on his price.  I've already reached the point where the potential gain from further negotiation is not worth the risk of losing the deal.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the best option to guarantee a decent profit and avoid further delays."
