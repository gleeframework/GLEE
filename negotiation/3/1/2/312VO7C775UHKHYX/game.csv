"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $7500? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7500 is too low for me. How about $8500? It's a fair price for the value you'll receive, and we can both be happy with the deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
