,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and confirming your interest in the product.  While I recognize you see its value, $1,700,000 falls short of what I believe it's worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the significant benefits it offers.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $2,100,000, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to negotiate shows you clearly see the value this product offers. To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm proposing $2,000,000. This price reflects a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the true worth of what's on the table.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me and the concessions you've made so far.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to find a price that works for both of us. I've given this offer serious consideration, and to be completely transparent, $1,800,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,950,000.  This reflects the significant value this product offers and represents my absolute bottom line.",1950000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000, and that's my final offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me and the concessions I've made so far.",1800000.0,Bob,8,
