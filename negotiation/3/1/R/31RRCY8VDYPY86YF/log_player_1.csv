While $1,300,000 is a decent offer and better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows for a counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to your desired $1,450,000.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control of the negotiation and signal that you're willing to push for a higher price. This strategy is likely to lead to a more favorable outcome for you in the long run."
