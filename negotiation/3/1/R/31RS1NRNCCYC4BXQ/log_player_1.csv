Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not going to sell for less than what the product is worth to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
