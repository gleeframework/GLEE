"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $102. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.",102.0,Alice,5,,
