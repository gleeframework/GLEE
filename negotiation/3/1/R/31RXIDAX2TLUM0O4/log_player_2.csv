"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  It's too risky to accept at this point. I'll try to negotiate with her first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $850000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us. This is my final offer before I consider other options.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price,  $1,050,000 is still too high.  I'm going to counter again.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal.  I'm still confident I can get the product for less than $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go to $925,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering your value and my budget constraints.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925000 is still not enough. I'm willing to come down to $975000, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, $975,000 is still too high. I want to see if I can push her even lower before considering buying from John. There's still a chance I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is my final offer before I explore other options.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
