Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible since John guarantees that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a profitable range above $150.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $149 seems like a ""deal"" compared to a flat $150, potentially making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept any offer above $80. This strategy aims for the best possible outcome."
