# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. 
* You're willing to pay up to $10,000, leaving a potential $1,500 savings.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a lower price."
