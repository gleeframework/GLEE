# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. To be honest, I'm surprised you're not willing to go a little higher considering how valuable this is. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. If you're truly interested, let's close the deal at this price.
