,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, but it reflects my desire to work with you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. To be honest, I'm surprised you're not willing to go a little higher considering how valuable this is. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. If you're truly interested, let's close the deal at this price.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, but I'll throw in a $20,000 bonus if you accept the offer. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
