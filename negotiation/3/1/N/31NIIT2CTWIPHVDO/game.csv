"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $9,250. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth much more to you. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal. Let me know if you're open to this.",9000.0,Bob,4,
