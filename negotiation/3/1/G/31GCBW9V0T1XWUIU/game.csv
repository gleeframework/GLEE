"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable with a price closer to $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go up to $9,800. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet at $9,500?  This would allow you to make a decent profit while also saving me some money.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10,200? This is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a bit higher than your last offer. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $9,850. It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",9850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,850. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where I should consider other offers. However, I'm still interested in selling to you. How about we meet at $10,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue the negotiation.  However, $10,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $9,900.  This is a good compromise, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a good deal. What do you think?",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the bottom of the barrel. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you the product for $10,050. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",10050.0,Alice,9,
