"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is less than the $150 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's a good compromise. He's offering $110, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within his budget. This counteroffer shows that he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $120? That's still a good deal for you, considering how much it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $120, which is within Bob's budget and a better deal than John's offer.  While Bob might want to try and negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the next counteroffer and ultimately stick with her current price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking losing the deal."
