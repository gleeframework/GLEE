{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $110 is still below my minimum, and I have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $120? That's still a good deal for you, considering how much it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 120}
