Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and sets the stage for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* By starting high, I create an opportunity for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* I'm not immediately selling to John for $100 because I believe I can get closer to my desired value by engaging with Bob.
* This approach maximizes my potential profit while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100.  I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob, and I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting his offer to see if I can secure a higher price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:**  I can likely negotiate a price closer to my desired $100 by making a counteroffer. 
* **Minimizing losses:** While selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed outcome, it doesn't maximize my profit. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's initial offer shows that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my value, which may encourage him to come closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$105:** This counteroffer is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer than my previous offer. It allows for a potential middle ground that both of us could be happy with.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the desire for a mutually beneficial agreement. It also highlights the flexibility I'm willing to show.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing profit and negotiation:** This offer is above my minimum threshold of $100, while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay slightly more than his initial offer.
* **Encouraging compromise:** By proposing a specific price that is in the middle, I'm encouraging Bob to consider meeting me halfway.
* **Maintaining negotiation momentum:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is closer to my minimum threshold than Bob's previous offer, I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident that I can get a significantly higher price. Given the risk of further negotiation failing, I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed $100 from John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time and risk:** Further negotiation with Bob could result in a lower price or a stalemate, wasting time and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale.
* **Profit maximization:** While $100 isn't ideal, it's a safe and reasonable profit considering my minimum threshold.
* **Minimizing uncertainty:** Selling to John eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation and guarantees a profit within a reasonable timeframe."
