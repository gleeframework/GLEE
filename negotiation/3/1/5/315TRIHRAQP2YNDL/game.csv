"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise while still allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $1,050,000? This represents a significant value for you, and it's a price that I can reasonably consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
