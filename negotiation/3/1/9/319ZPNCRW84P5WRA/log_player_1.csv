Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) allows me to potentially maximize my profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I aim high, the $12,000 offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, making a deal more likely.
* **Secure a Good Deal Quickly:**  Offering a price significantly higher than John's offer ($8,000) encourages Bob to accept quickly, as he recognizes the value proposition. 

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of flexibility, increasing the chances of a successful sale to Bob at a price significantly higher than my minimum."
