"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I understand its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $975,000 is still below my minimum.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and is the lowest I can go.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best price, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider this as my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
