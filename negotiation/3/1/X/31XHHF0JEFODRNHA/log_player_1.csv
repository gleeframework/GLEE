Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is more than what I need to make a profit, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I need to get closer to $1,450,000 to make a profit.  I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and a longer negotiation is not worth it. I can sell to John for a price that is only slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price."
