"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1,000,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, and it's a fair price for me considering its value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
