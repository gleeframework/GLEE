Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment and the offer of $750,000.  To bridge the gap and finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $760,000. This represents a significant investment for you and a fair price for me, considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal.

Alice has come down significantly, and $760,000 is a good price compared to John's offer of $800,000. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and further haggling risks losing the deal."
