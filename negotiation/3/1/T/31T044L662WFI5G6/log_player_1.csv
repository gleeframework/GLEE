I've reached a point where I need to make a decision. I'm unwilling to go lower than $890,000, but Bob is adamant about $880,000.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
