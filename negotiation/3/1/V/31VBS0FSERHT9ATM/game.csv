"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is quite interesting to me, but $800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $700,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $600,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 might still be a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $650,000. I think this is as low as I can go and still get a good return on my investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $650,000 is getting much closer to what I can do.  How about we split the difference and settle at $625,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 was a tough pill to swallow, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $625,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $630,000. I think this is as low as I can go and still get a decent return on my investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",630000.0,Alice,7,
