"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 might still be a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $650,000. I think this is as low as I can go and still get a good return on my investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $650,000 is getting much closer to what I can do.  How about we split the difference and settle at $625,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 625000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 was a tough pill to swallow, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $625,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $630,000. I think this is as low as I can go and still get a decent return on my investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $630,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $630,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit but seems to be reaching her lower limit.  Continuing to negotiate might result in smaller concessions, and the difference at this point is not significant enough to risk losing the deal altogether."
