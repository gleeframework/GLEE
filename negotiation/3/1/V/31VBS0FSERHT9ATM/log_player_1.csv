Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is quite interesting to me, but $800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a significant amount to you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $700,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $600,000? That feels like a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
