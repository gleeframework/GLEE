"Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to accept $17000 for the product?  It's a good starting point for us to work with.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your counteroffer. $17000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial price. Would you consider $18500?  I believe this is still a fair price for the value of the product.",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of the product, but $18500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go up to $18000.  This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",18000.0,Bob,4,
