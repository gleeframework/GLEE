Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Alice is getting closer to your limit, but you're also getting close to John's price. One more counter-offer might secure a better deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go up to $11,500. However, I'm willing to make one more small concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,800, which is worse than John's offer.  Cut your losses and buy from John to secure the best deal."
