Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $140. How about we meet right in the middle of my previous offer and your last one at $142.50? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $142.50. At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $150 makes more sense than potentially wasting more rounds haggling with Alice."
