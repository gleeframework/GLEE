"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While the product looks promising, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,200. This is a one-time deal, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer from anyone else. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,200 is still a bit high.  Would you consider $10,800?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional support and training to help you get the most out of the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate the additional benefits you're offering.  However, I'm still focused on finding the right price for the product itself. While I'm interested in the product and your support, I'm not able to go above $11,000. Would you be willing to reconsider that price? I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm still confident that the product will provide significant value to you, and I'm willing to take a small risk to make the deal happen. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can reach a fair agreement that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product, considering the value it offers and the additional support you've mentioned. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to throw in an additional bonus, worth $500, to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,9,,500.0
