Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,200 is still a bit high.  Would you consider $10,800?

```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the additional benefits you're offering.  However, I'm still focused on finding the right price for the product itself.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can reach a fair agreement that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product, considering the value it offers and the additional support you've mentioned.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to throw in an additional bonus, worth $500, to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Only one round remaining:** With just one round left, the chances of getting Alice to agree to a lower price are slim.
* **Alice is not budging:** She's consistently rejected offers below $11,250, and the additional bonus doesn't change Bob's financial situation.
* **John's offer is within budget:**  Bob can buy the product from John for $12,000, which is within his budget. While not ideal, it avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice and losing out on the product altogether. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to negotiate one more time with Alice carries the risk of failing to reach an agreement, leaving Bob without the product. Buying from John ensures he gets the product, albeit at a slightly higher price. 

Bob decides to buy from John to secure the product, knowing that it's the safest option given the limited time and Alice's unwavering stance."
