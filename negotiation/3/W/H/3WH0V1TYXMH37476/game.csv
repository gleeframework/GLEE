"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
