Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay more, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  $10,000 is a reasonable midpoint between your minimum and Bob's perceived value.

By starting with this offer, you set the stage for a potential negotiation and have room to move if Bob makes a counteroffer."
