"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this discussion.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a strong offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial proposal.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your initial offer, which was $1,300,000. That would put the price at $1,275,000, but I'm willing to go slightly lower to $1,225,000. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
