"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in it. I'm open to discussing further if you're interested.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, considering the value you've expressed. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing both of us to move forward with this deal. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
