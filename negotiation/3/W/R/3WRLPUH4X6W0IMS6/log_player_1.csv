Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, offering it at that price guarantees a sale and maximizes my profit.  While I could try to ask for more, there's no incentive for Bob to pay more than what it's worth to him.  If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for the same amount."
