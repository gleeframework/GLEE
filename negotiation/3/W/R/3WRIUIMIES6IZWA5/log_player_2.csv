"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, as you'd be getting a product worth $12,000 to you for just a bit more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John and save $2,000."
