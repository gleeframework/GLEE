Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $19,000 represents a roughly 27% markup, which is a significant increase but not so high that it would likely scare Bob away without consideration. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $19,000, the message's tone suggests there might be some flexibility, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high."
