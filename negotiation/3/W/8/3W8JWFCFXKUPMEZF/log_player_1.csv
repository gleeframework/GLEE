Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This will give me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I still think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $175. This is still a significant profit for me and is closer to his offer, hopefully encouraging him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking a further negotiation, as I can sell to John for the same price. It's better to lock in the deal now and avoid potential further rejection from Bob."
