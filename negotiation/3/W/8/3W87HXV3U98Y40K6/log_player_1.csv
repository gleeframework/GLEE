Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob values the product at $80, it's always good to start negotiations higher than their perceived value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A price of $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for Alice if he accepts.
* **Considering the alternative:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $150, so there's no pressure to go below that price. This knowledge allows for a strong starting point in the negotiation with Bob."
