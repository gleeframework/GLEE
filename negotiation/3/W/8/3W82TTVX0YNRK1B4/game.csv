"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a $10,000 limit. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm still not able to meet the $11,000 price point. Could you possibly lower it to $10,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $10,750?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still working within a strict budget, and I'm unable to meet the $10,750 price point. Could you consider lowering it to $10,600? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10600.0,Bob,6,
