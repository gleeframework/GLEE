"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest price. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price within your budget.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to your budget of $800,000. While it's still slightly higher, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in a smaller price reduction. You have a good chance of securing the product at a price within your budget by accepting this offer. Further negotiation may not be worth the time and effort if you're willing to accept a price that's only slightly above your budget."
