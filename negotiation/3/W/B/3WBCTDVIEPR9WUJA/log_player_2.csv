"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000.  I know it's a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects its full worth.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal quickly and smoothly.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer matches the product's value to you, there's no incentive to accept immediately.  You can try to get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you might prompt her to lower the price in a counter-offer. If she doesn't, you can always fall back on buying from John at the same price."
