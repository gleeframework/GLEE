Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $119 is my initial offer, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing me to potentially earn even more.
* **Backup Option:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John, so there's no pressure to go below my minimum price."
