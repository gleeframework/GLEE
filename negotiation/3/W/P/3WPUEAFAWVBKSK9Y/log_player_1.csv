Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, so he is willing to pay up to that amount.
* **My value:** I value the product at $120, so I need to get at least that amount to be satisfied.
* **John's value:** I have a backup buyer, John, who will pay $120. This sets the minimum I'm willing to accept from Bob.
* **Negotiation:** By offering $140, I am leaving room for negotiation, but also ensuring I get a price closer to Bob's valuation, potentially leading to a quicker sale and a higher profit than selling to John."
