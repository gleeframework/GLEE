"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum, hoping to get as close to my ideal value as possible. I'm confident that John will be available if Bob rejects my offer, so I'm not afraid to push for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I have 8 rounds left, and John is still an option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$140 is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I have six rounds left and John is always an option, so I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm willing to come down a little further to $145. This is only $5 below my minimum, and I think it's a fair price considering Bob's initial offer of $125. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is below my minimum value of $150.  With only four rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob is increasing.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I reach my minimum value and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
