"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, which is a great value considering its potential. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:** Bob starts with a counteroffer of $7,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point.
* **Reasoning:** By offering $7,500, Bob demonstrates that he's serious about buying the product but also sets a clear boundary. He's hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice's new offer of $8,500 is still higher than Bob's budget of $8,000.
* **Opportunity to Save:** Bob has a chance to potentially save $500 by continuing to negotiate with Alice.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, Bob might be able to secure the product for a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. 

**Strategy:**  It's worth making another counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go lower. There's a chance Bob can get the product for closer to his desired price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $8,500 is still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,250, which is a fair compromise and within my budget.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:**  Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but still trying to save some money.
* **Small Increment:** The counteroffer is only $250 lower than Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to accept the offer."
