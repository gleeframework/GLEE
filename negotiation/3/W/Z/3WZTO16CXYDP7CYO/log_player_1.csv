Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the market value and the potential benefits I'll gain from the product.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $700,000 significantly undervalues its true worth and potential.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $775,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear that his price ceiling might not reach my minimum.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed win at this point, rather than risking further negotiation with Bob."
