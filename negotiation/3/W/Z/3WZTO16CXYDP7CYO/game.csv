"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the market value and the potential benefits I'll gain from the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $700,000 significantly undervalues its true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll be receiving.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $775,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
