"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",825000.0,Alice,5,
