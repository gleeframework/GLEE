"Alice, thank you for your offer, however, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  This is a serious offer and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While we understand your current budget constraints, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we consider a price of $1500000 for the product? This price reflects the value we place on it while remaining within your budget considerations. I look forward to your thoughts on this offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1500000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1250000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
