"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we consider the product worth $1,100,000 for me?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the product's true value. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still quite high for my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,200,000? This would allow us to close the gap and move towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
