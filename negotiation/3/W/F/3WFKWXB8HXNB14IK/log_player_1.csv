{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for the negotiation. By setting the price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we consider the product worth $1,100,000 for me? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the product's true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still quite high for my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,200,000? This would allow us to close the gap and move towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer allows me to achieve my goal of earning at least $1,200,000 for the product without needing to continue negotiating."
