"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,500?  This would give us both a good deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,000, so I'm thinking of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
