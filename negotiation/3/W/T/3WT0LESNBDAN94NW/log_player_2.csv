"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $130. It's not a good deal for me at this price. I will reject her offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $115 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is closer to my target, it's still slightly more than I'm willing to pay. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
