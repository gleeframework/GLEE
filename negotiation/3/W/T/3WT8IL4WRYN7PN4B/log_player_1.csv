Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) without losing the sale.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high but justifiable price sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's more likely the final price will be closer to your desired range.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. It allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is expected:** This offer is a starting point. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product helps justify the high price. You want Bob to understand why it's worth his investment."
