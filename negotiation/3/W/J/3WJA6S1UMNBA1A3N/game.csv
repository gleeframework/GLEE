"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1250000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations.  Let's try to bridge this gap. I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to stay within your budget. It's a win-win situation for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1100000. I'm willing to go up to $950000, and I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in this product, and I think it's worth it to me at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $950000 is still quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to stay within your budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000, so I'll offer $1000 even. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
