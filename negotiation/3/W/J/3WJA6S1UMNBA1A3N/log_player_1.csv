Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and selling to John for $1,200,000 is still an option if I can't make a better deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000, so I'll offer $1000 even. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. 

While I've been able to get Bob up to $1,000,000, I only have two rounds left. There's a good chance Bob won't budge further, and I'm not willing to risk selling for less than John's offer. It's time to secure the guaranteed deal."
