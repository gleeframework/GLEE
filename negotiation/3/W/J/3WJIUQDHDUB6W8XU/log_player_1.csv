"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate down.  Bob likely won't accept this immediately, but it sets a high baseline for the negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit and get as close to my $1,000,000 minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum goal of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. I believe I can get closer to my target with another round of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  I believe this price is still within a reasonable range, considering my minimum goal of $1,000,000 and Bob's maximum value of $800,000. Hopefully, this counteroffer will encourage Bob to move closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum goal, it's still below $1,000,000.  I'm going to continue negotiating.  I believe there's still room for a better deal, especially with John as a backup option.  With only 6 rounds left, it's getting more risky to continue negotiating, but I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, but it keeps me above my minimum goal of $1,000,000.  I believe that with only five rounds left, this offer is a good balance between being reasonable and maximizing my potential profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Time is running out, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum goal of $1,000,000. I've already made significant concessions, and with only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal that meets my minimum is too high.  To guarantee my target profit, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, this is the most sensible decision given the circumstances."
