"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is selling it for $12,000, which is a $3,000 savings.
* **You are not obligated to get the best possible deal.** While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the current offer is a good deal, and trying to haggle further might risk losing the deal entirely."
