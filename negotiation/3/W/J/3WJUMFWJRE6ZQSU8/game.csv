,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,150,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to gain something from this deal.  Let's make it happen.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1,087,500. This is a fair price that lets us both walk away feeling good about the deal.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,087,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,080,000 is still a bit below what I need. To be fair, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,085,000. This is a very small difference from your last offer, and I believe it's a good compromise that allows us both to close this deal. What do you think?",1085000.0,Alice,7,
