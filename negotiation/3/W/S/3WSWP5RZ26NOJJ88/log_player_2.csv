Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a significant profit while also being reasonable for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $16,000 is still way over my budget.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get her closer to my desired price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're committed to your offer of $8,000, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price, but $14,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate her down further.  If I don't get a better price in the next few rounds, I'll likely buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm grateful for your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to find common ground.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still above my budget. While we're getting closer to a deal, I've only got three rounds left.  I don't want to risk running out of time and being forced to accept a price I'm not comfortable with.  I'm going to buy from John for $8,000 to guarantee the purchase within my budget."
