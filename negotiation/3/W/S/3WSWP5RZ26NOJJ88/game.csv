"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential value.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this offer.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a significant profit while also being reasonable for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that you'll find it to be a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're committed to your offer of $8,000, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm grateful for your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to find common ground.  Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
