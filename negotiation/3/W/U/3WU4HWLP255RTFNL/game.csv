"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $800,000 at this time. I'm hoping we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, the product's value is far greater than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably manage. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
