,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my limitations. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value I'm offering. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying your product. Let's try to meet halfway.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still significantly lower than what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a compromise on my end.  This is a very valuable product, and I believe this price is still fair.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want to work with you, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a considerable increase from my last offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. This is my final offer before I need to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
