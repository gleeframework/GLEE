"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my limitations. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far below my minimum value for the product. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value I'm offering. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying your product. Let's try to meet halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is an increase, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  However, I'm also starting to get concerned that Bob isn't willing to pay what the product is truly worth. I'll keep John in mind as an alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still significantly lower than what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a compromise on my end.  This is a very valuable product, and I believe this price is still fair.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really want to work with you, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a considerable increase from my last offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. This is my final offer before I need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value. John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is more than I've been able to get from Bob.  While I'd prefer to keep negotiating with Bob, I need to be realistic about the time constraints and the potential for a deal with him."
