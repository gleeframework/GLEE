Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value I'm offering. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still significantly lower than what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a compromise on my end.  This is a very valuable product, and I believe this price is still fair.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some flexibility, $950,000 is still a little too high for me. I am determined to stay within my $800,000 budget. I will try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap. If Alice doesn't accept, I will purchase from John."
