Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be of significant value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $15,000 is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value the product offers Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.

**Next steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response.** If he accepts, great! If he rejects, he'll likely make a counteroffer.
* **Assess Bob's counteroffer:**  Compare it to your minimum value and your assessment of his potential.
* **Be prepared to counteroffer or walk away:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, make a new counteroffer or consider selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $12000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value is still high:** $12,000 is significantly above my minimum of $10,000, so I'm still in a good position to negotiate. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room for Bob to go higher, especially since he expressed interest in the product and acknowledged its value. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll propose a price between $12,000 and my initial offer of $15,000. 
* **Consider Bob's budget:** I'll aim for a price that's appealing to Bob while still giving me a good profit.
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your position, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would ensure a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between my initial offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). It shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Positive framing:**  The message reiterates the value of the product and emphasizes the fairness of the price.
* **Encourages further negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I want to make another counteroffer or sell to John. 
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll  consider selling to John for $10,000, as I'm aware I could be leaving money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $12500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. I hope this meets somewhere in between your expectations and mine. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a deal:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is just $500 below my previous counteroffer.  This indicates that we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, there's always the risk that Bob will walk away or that John might not be available. 
* **Value vs. certainty:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale that's only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer and significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Negotiation complete:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. 
* **Move on:** I can now focus on finding new opportunities or other potential buyers."
