Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps keep the negotiation focused.

By starting at $100, I leave room to go down slightly if Bob counters. However, I also have the option to accept John's offer of $120 if negotiations with Bob stall. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while still keeping the possibility of a deal with Bob open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a better offer than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range. I'm confident I can get a better deal than $90, especially considering John is willing to pay $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I value the product at more than $90, I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $95, which is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Lower than my minimum:** This gives me some wiggle room.
* **Reasonable for both of us:** I believe $95 is a fair price, considering Bob's interest and my willingness to negotiate.

I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the speed of closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept. This approach allows me to explore further negotiation while maintaining a good chance of a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I really want to make this deal work, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I appreciate Bob's persistence and his desire to make this deal work, his offer of $85 is simply too low. It falls below my minimum of $120 and significantly less than what John is offering.

At this point, it's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John for $120 and secure a profitable deal. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a deal that's not in my best interest."
