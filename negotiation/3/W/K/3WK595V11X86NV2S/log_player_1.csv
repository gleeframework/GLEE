"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $100. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $100 is better than $80 from John,  I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob, especially since he recognizes the value of the product. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $110? That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and am willing to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. This still saves you some money compared to your original asking price while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep negotiating and potentially get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than what John is offering and still within a reasonable range for both of us."
