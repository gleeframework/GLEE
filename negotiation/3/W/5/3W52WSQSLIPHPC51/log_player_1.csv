"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in great condition and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try to get a better deal. I have 9 more rounds, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob. However, if I reject his offer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not quite ready to sell for $8,000 just yet.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I am willing to negotiate but still aim for a price closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price.  Bob has not budged from $8,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John for $8,000 would be the same outcome, and there's no point in risking a lower offer."
