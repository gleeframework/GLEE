**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice's offer is exactly that amount, there's no room for negotiation or saving money.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John at the same price. This achieves Bob's goal of buying the product while ensuring he doesn't spend more than his budget."
