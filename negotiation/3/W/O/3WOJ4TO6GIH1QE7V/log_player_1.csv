"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's halfway between our valuations, aiming to start the negotiation in a reasonable place.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation, and I want to leave room for negotiation in case he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's initial offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to try and get closer to my desired price by sending a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $9,750 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $9,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $9,600 is only $100 less than my counteroffer of $9,750. It's getting close to my minimum desired price, and I'm not sure if I can get much more.  It's better to accept this offer than risk him walking away and forcing me to sell to John for a lower price."
