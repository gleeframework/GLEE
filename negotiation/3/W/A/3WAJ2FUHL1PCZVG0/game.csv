"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My starting price is $1800000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1600000 is a bit below what I can accept.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. However, based on my current financial situation, $1700000 is still slightly beyond my budget. I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1650000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
