Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to note that if Bob rejects this offer, I still have the option to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'd prefer to sell to him rather than John, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I will make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is still below my minimum, it's closer to it than Bob's previous offer and it's better than selling to John for $150. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal without risking a further negotiation that might result in a lower price."
