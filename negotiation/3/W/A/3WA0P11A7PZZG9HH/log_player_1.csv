Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you and this is a competitive price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still secures a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net.  Alice doesn't need to go below that price."
