"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $12,000 from Alice. It's worth negotiating further to try and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's offering just slightly above that. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and if Alice rejects, there's still room to move up without exceeding Bob's maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but still below his maximum price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  Bob might be able to get the product for a price closer to his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below Alice's offer.  He's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but also showing that he's not willing to pay the higher price Alice wants.  This strategy is designed to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting too close to Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate, as the potential savings are minimal.  It's better to accept the guaranteed price from John."
