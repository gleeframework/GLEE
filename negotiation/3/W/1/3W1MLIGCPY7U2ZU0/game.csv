"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900000.

"Bob, I understand your persistence in finding a better deal, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far away from the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's unique features and benefits. If you're still not satisfied, I'm open to considering other offers.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
