{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $60 is more than Bob's initial value, it's still far below my minimum of $150.  I'll counter with a higher price to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $90 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is tempting, it's still not close to my minimum of $150. I will continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $100 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
