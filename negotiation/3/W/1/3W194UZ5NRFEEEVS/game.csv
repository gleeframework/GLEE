"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $90 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $75? ",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $100 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
