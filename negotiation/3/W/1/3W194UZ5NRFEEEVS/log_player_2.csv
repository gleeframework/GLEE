Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $100 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $100.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $80, ensuring you stay within your budget."
