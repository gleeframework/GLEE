"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair reflection of its worth to me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value you placed on it, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a fair price considering your own valuation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I value the product at, but also takes into account the value you see in it. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering your own valuation and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what you're willing to pay, but still reflects its value to me. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
