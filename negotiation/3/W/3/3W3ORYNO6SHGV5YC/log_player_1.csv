Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This gives Bob a potential $3,000 in savings, but it also leaves me with a profit. It's a starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm offering $17,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to reach a deal, while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would have preferred a higher price, Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than what I'd get from John and it's not far from my desired price point.  I'll accept his offer."
