"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've shown interest in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value of $120, but not push him away with a too high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than nothing, I can likely still do better. I'm not too far off from my minimum price, and I believe that with a counteroffer I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $132 is still slightly below my minimum, I'm getting closer to my target and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer seems like the most reasonable choice at this point."
