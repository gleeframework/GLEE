"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $100?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  But $100 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to go up to $100.  Let's make a deal!",100.0,Bob,6,
