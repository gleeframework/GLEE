{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale."
