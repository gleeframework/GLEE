{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is a good starting point. $750,000 is a great price, but we can likely do better.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}

Let's start by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This will test the waters and see how willing she is to negotiate."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is showing some flexibility, but $600,000 is still a bit high. Let's see if we can get closer to our target price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's split the difference between our last offer and Alice's latest offer.  This shows we're serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise."

We're getting closer to our target price, but we're still not there. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a little bit more before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

Let's try one more time to get Alice closer to our target price. We'll offer $600,000, which is a compromise between our last offer and hers. If she rejects this offer, we might have to start considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've been negotiating for a while now and haven't been able to get Alice's price below $700,000. We have a limited number of rounds and John is offering the product for a price that is still within our budget. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
