"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12000 is outside of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8500 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $9800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
