"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's in your best interest to reject it and try to negotiate a lower price.  You'll need to get Alice closer to your $1,000,000 target.  Buying from John immediately is a backup option, but you can likely do better with Alice."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but she's getting closer to your target. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get her down further.  Buying from John is always a good option, but it's still worth trying to get a slightly better price from Alice."
