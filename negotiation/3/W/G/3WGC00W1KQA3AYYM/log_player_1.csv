This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially earn more while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum and selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

Bob has reached his limit, and his offer is now equal to what I can get from John. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, there's no point in continuing to negotiate if his offer won't increase.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
