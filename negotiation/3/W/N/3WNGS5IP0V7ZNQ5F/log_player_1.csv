"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious opening:** Starting high ($2,200,000) allows room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant profit beyond my minimum. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""value and potential,"" I aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message clearly indicates this is a ""starting price,"" signaling my willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving space to reach an agreement with Bob over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the potential of this product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,600,000 for it. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum, it's still a significant distance from my initial ask. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a price closer to my target. I'm willing to risk losing some profit margin to secure a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,950,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counter-offer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($1,600,000) and my previous ask ($2,200,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth by stating it ""reflects the true value."" This reinforces its desirability. 
* **Positive tone:**  By acknowledging Bob's interest and aiming for a ""middle ground,"" I maintain a collaborative and solution-oriented approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,750,000 for the product.  This is a reasonable offer that allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated. While $1,750,000 is tempting, I believe I can still push for a better price in the remaining rounds. The risk of losing him to John is calculated, as his consistent counter-offers suggest a strong interest in closing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your determination to acquire the product speaks volumes.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I propose a final offer of $1,850,000. This price reflects the significant value you're gaining while acknowledging the effort we've both put into this negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By labeling this a ""final offer,"" I signal that I'm unwilling to go lower, adding weight to the proposal.
* **Meeting in the middle (again):**  This offer splits the difference between the previous two proposals, showing a continued commitment to compromise.
* **Highlighting his gain:** Emphasizing the ""significant value"" Bob will gain reinforces the attractiveness of the deal.
* **Acknowledging effort:** Recognizing our joint investment in the negotiation fosters a sense of collaboration and encourages a positive response. 

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly above John's offer while increasing the likelihood of closing the deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,850,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I can afford. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a strategic point to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Finality:**  Bob has stated this is his ""final offer,"" creating a sense of urgency and limiting potential for further negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a real risk of Bob walking away and me ending up with John's lower offer of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Profit:** $1,700,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's a favorable outcome compared to the risk of losing Bob entirely. 

Accepting now secures a very good deal and avoids potentially jeopardizing the sale."
