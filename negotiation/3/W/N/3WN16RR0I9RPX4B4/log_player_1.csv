Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum value:**  This ensures you make a profit. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and a chance to find a price that works for both of you. 

Remember, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's willing to negotiate. This means there's still potential to reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm only willing to go up to $775,000. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $775,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob is willing to negotiate further, and his offer is closer to my desired range. 

**Next Step:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a compromise that works for both of us. I'm hoping to get him to budge a little higher."
