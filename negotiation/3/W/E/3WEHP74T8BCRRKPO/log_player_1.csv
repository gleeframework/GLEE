"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough spot to be in so early. Bob went right to his limit, and it matches John's offer.  While I could try to negotiate up, there's a real risk Bob won't budge. 

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk Bob sticking to his offer or walking away entirely."
