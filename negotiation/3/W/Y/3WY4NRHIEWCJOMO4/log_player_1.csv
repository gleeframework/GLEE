Round 2
Bob's offer:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to sell it for significantly less than my minimum.  I'll see if I can get him closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $75 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $78? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm feeling the pressure to close the deal, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $78 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $81? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 81}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice! I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we go with $79? It's the last bit of wiggle room I have, but I really want to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get $80, we're getting close to the end of our rounds.  Selling to Bob for $79 is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for less."
