"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially far exceeding its market price. While I can't disclose the exact nature of this product, I'm confident it can be of great benefit to you. My asking price is $1500000, which reflects the potential value I see in it.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
