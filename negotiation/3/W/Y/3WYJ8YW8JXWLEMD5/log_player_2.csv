While I can't disclose the exact nature of this product, I'm confident it can be of great benefit to you. My asking price is $1500000, which reflects the potential value I see in it.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested.
