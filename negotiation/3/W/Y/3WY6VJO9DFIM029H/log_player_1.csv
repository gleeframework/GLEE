Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this item. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, so I'm proposing a price of $150. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Gauging Interest:** The $150 offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.  You can always lower the price, but you can't go higher once an offer is made.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, be prepared that a very high initial offer might discourage Bob from further negotiation."
