{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and want to see if I can push for a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and explore the possibility of a higher price."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly higher offer.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good price while minimizing the risk of getting a worse deal."
