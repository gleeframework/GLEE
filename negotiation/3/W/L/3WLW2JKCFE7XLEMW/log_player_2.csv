"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is well above his maximum price point. He's better off trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while still being a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you, even beyond the $800,000 you mentioned it's worth.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,000,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,000,000 is a better price than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be completely transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $800,000.  I'm willing to accept that if we can close the deal now. This offer reflects the true value of what I'm providing and my desire to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  This is the price he would pay John, and it seems like Alice is firm on this price.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a better price, and he risks losing the deal entirely."
