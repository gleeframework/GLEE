{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a slightly higher price ($100) than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. It also shows confidence in the value of the product."
