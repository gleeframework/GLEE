"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it falls short of what I need to achieve my desired outcome.  However, I'm willing to be flexible and propose a price of $1,000,000. This price allows both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this product will deliver significant value to you, and I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
