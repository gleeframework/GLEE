Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1450000} 

This offer is a good starting point because it is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. This strategy allows for potential profit while also encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and what I believe the product is worth. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's less than what the product is worth to him, and it's closer to my desired price point. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than the price I want to achieve. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1390000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,390,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,385,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,385,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just slightly lower than my last counteroffer, but it's getting closer to my desired price and is still significantly better than selling to John. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in smaller increments, so I'll accept his offer and finalize the deal."
