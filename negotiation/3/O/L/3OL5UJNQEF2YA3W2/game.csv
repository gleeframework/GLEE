"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Can you meet me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  This would still be a great price for you and would allow me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $9000 - $1000 = $8000. Can you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,4,
