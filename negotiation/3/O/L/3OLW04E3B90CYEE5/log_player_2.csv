You should reject Alice's offer. $950,000 is still above your budget, and you can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $850,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000, reflecting the value it holds for both of us.  I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

While $900,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get the price down to $850,000 or lower. If not, you can always buy from John for $800,000."
