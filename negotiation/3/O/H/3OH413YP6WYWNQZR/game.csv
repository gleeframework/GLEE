"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. ",60.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. It's a fair price considering the value I put into the product.",90.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget, Alice. How about we try $70?  That feels like a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $70 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $90, which would be $80. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",80.0,Alice,5,,
