"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I believe would be a great addition to your business. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a steal considering its value and potential. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me halfway?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $15000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17500?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers. What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",16000.0,Bob,4,
