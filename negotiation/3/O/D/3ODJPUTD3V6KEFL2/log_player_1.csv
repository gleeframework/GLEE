Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but we need to give Bob a reason to buy from us instead of us going with John. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it for anything above that gives him potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While we start high, the message is open to discussion. Bob might counter-offer, and we have room to go slightly lower while still making a significant gain.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing your profit beyond your guaranteed sale to John."
