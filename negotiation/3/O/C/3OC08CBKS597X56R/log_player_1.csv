{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts with a price close to the middle ground between your minimum desired price and Bob's perceived value.  This strategy balances maximizing your profit with keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending under $100. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $85 is still a little low for me.  How about $90? That would still be a great price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 90}
