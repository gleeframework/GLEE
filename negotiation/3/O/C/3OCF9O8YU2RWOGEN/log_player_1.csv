Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a backup offer, you can aim higher than your minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects its worth in the market.  Please let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,400,000  is significantly below Bob's perceived value, giving him a potential $100,000 gain.
* **Confident Tone:** The message implies the product's value and doesn't suggest desperation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While the offer is firm, the tone allows Bob to counter-offer if he wishes.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you're still in a strong position to sell to John at your minimum price."
