"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 

Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. If that fails, you have the option of buying from John at your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000, offering that amount as your counteroffer makes sense. This sets a firm limit and makes it clear you're willing to pay your top price for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,375,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for your maximum price, it's the most sensible choice to avoid further negotiations and secure the product at your desired price."
