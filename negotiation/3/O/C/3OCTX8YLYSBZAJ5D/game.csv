"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
