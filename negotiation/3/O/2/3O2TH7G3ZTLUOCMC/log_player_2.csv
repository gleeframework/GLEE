(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You have room to go lower than $1,100,000 and still get a better deal than buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering Alice $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from her original price and still leaves her with a profit. It also gives me a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating with her to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,075,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price that's closer to my ideal range."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum but still too high.  I'll counter again, but if she doesn't budge much, I'll consider buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm going up to $1,100,000.  This is closer to Alice's offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves me with a decent saving."

Alice's offer is now equal to John's price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice. I'll buy from John to ensure I get the product."
