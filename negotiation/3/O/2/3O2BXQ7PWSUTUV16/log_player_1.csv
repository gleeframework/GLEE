Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:**  By starting at $12,000, I aim to maximize my potential profit.
* **Be flexible:** I'm prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum threshold of $15,000.
* **Use John as leverage:**  The knowledge that I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000 gives me negotiating power.
* **Focus on value:** I'll emphasize the product's value to Bob to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can work within a lower budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I'm certain this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I understand his desire to work within a lower budget, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, or, as a last resort, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  However, $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce the price to $11,500. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $11,500, a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget but emphasize the value of the product and the importance of a fair price.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer is designed to show flexibility while still protecting my interests. I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a price that undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my situation. I've reviewed your latest offer, and while it's a step in the right direction, I still feel that we might be able to reach a more equitable agreement. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This allows me to stay within my budget while still acknowledging the value of your product. I hope this suggestion is acceptable, and I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I would prefer to sell to John for $15,000, accepting Bob's offer would still result in a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of the negotiation collapsing. It's also a positive sign that Bob is willing to compromise."
