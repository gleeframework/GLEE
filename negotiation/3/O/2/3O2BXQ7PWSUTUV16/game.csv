"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can work within a lower budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I'm certain this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  However, $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce the price to $11,500. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my situation. I've reviewed your latest offer, and while it's a step in the right direction, I still feel that we might be able to reach a more equitable agreement. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This allows me to stay within my budget while still acknowledging the value of your product. I hope this suggestion is acceptable, and I look forward to your response.",11000.0,Bob,4,
