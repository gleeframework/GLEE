"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below my $150 limit.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's offer while clearly stating my desired price.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility and help me understand her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's still a fair price for the product and its value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit from her initial offer, but we still have room to negotiate. I'm aiming to get the price closer to $120. I'll continue the negotiation in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle? I'd be willing to pay $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that works for me.
* **Direct and Fair:** Offering $120 is a direct counter to Alice's move. It's possible she might accept this as it's a fair price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it puts me in a good position for the remaining rounds of negotiation."
