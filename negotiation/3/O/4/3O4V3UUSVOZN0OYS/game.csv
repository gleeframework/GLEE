"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's worth to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone, but I'm willing to go to $11,000.  This is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product, and hopefully, it works for you too.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I think the product's value to you justifies this price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $11,750. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",11750.0,Alice,5,
