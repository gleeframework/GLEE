"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but below my minimum ($15,000).  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000, which is closer to my initial offer and still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. I can go up to $11,500. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but $11,500 is still too low.  How about $12,500? This is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway and gives him an incentive to accept."
