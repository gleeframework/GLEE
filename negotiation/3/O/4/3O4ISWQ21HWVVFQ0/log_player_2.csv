Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $15,500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $15,000.  It makes more sense to buy from John at the known $15,000 price and avoid further negotiation."
