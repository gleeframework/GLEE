"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $16,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I believe that's a reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $15,500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
