"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9500 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $10500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your last offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $10250. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this price?",10250.0,Bob,6,
