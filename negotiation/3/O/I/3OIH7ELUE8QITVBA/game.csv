"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a considerable amount to me, and I believe it holds even greater value for your company. My asking price is $1400000. This is a fair price that reflects both the inherent value of the product and the potential it offers you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but also allows for a more mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is a tempting offer, it falls short of what I believe the product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it also allows for a more reasonable deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1250000. This price still allows for a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
