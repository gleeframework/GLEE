Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is a tempting offer, it falls short of what I believe the product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it also allows for a more reasonable deal for both of us.
