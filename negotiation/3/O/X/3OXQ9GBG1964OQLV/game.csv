"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1075000.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1062500 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $1087500. This price is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it gives us a good chance to close this deal. What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
