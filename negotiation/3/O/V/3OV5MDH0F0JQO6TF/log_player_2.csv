"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its exceptional quality and value, it is worth $15000 to me. However, considering its worth to you is $12000, I am willing to negotiate. My initial offer to you is $13500. This price allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or making a purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
