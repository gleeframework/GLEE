"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to increase his interest.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  $100 allows for negotiation, preventing an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Potential for better outcome:**  While I can sell to John for $80, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob by continuing negotiations. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to my target range, hopefully finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $85 is a compromise between my minimum of $80 and Bob's offer of $70. 
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll gain by accepting the offer, increasing his incentive.
* **Creating urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, the message implies a willingness to compromise, which could encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further room for negotiation:**  Accepting this offer ensures I don't lose time and potentially get a worse price in future rounds.
* **Selling to John would be the same:**  While selling to John for $80 is an option, it doesn't offer any advantage over accepting Bob's offer."
