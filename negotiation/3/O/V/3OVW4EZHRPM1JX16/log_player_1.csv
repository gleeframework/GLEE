Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it.  I'm asking for $17,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. Offering the product at $17,000 creates a negotiation buffer. 

* **If Bob accepts:** You make a profit above your minimum and John's offer.
* **If Bob negotiates:** You have room to lower the price and still get more than $15,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** You can sell to John at your desired minimum price. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase the product."
