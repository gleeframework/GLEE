"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $8500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer of $8500, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,5,
