"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'm offering it for $1,000 more.  This gives Bob room to negotiate, but hopefully, he'll see the value and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. I still want to make a decent profit, but I also want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to sell for closer to $10,000,  $9,500 is a good price considering the limited time left.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
