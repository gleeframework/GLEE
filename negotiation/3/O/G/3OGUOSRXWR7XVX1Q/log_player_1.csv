Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000. I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment given its potential value."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, my goal is to maximize my profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer of $950,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate, but still ensures I make a significant profit even if he accepts the initial price.
* **Strong Initial Offer:** Starting with a strong offer increases the chances of Bob accepting it outright."
