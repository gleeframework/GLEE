"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,750. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,250. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,
