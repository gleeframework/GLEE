"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. I'm confident it could be worth $100 to you, which is its true value. However, I'm willing to consider your perspective. Would you like to start by discussing a price that works for both of us?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to discussion. That said, $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $80. Given the quality and value of the product, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about considering $95 as a starting point for further discussion?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $95 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
