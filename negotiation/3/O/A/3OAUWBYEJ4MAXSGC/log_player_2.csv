"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. I'm confident it could be worth $100 to you, which is its true value. However, I'm willing to consider your perspective. Would you like to start by discussing a price that works for both of us? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation to get closer to my $100 limit.  I'll counteroffer and see how she responds."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $80. Given the quality and value of the product, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about considering $95 as a starting point for further discussion? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, $95 is still a bit more than I want to spend. I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my last one."
