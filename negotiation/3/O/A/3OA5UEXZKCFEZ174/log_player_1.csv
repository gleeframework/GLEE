"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This opening offer is aggressive but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also important to remember John is a backup option, so if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is still a significant amount of money, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I can always fall back on John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still represents a significant value to you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  John is always a viable option if I need to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $775,000 just isn't enough.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $825,000. This gives you a great price while ensuring I can make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $825,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $790,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $790,000 is close to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds. If we don't reach an agreement soon, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  $790,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at $800,000 to make this work for me. It's my minimum, and I'm confident this product will be worth even more to you in the long run.  This is my final offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
