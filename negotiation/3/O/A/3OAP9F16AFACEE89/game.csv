"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product,  $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant investment for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider an offer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for this revolutionary product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product has value, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you $890,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  $890,000 is still a bit too high for me, and I'm hesitant to go any higher.   I'm sticking with my previous offer of $875,000,  and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're hesitant to go higher, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you $880,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.
