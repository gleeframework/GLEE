"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Bob,4,
