{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is high, and she's clearly trying to emphasize the value of the product.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy. There's room to negotiate, and I can gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your position. We've carefully evaluated your offer and while we're grateful for your interest, we must respectfully decline it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original offer, but $700,000 is still a significant amount. I want to see if I can push her lower. By rejecting and making another counteroffer, I can continue to gauge her flexibility and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We understand your perspective and are committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution. After reviewing our costs and the value proposition of our product, we're willing to consider an offer of $675000. We believe this price reflects the exceptional quality and potential impact of our product. We hope this proposal will help us reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $675,000 is a price I can reasonably accept. It's less than the $1,000,000 I'd pay John, and it's closer to my last counteroffer. It seems likely that further negotiation might only result in small changes in price, and I'm comfortable closing the deal at this point."
