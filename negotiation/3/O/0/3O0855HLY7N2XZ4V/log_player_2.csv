Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you at $152, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $150. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $150 than risk Alice not budging further and potentially missing out on a deal entirely."
