"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to close the deal at this point.",850000.0,Bob,4,
