"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value proposition:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob, hinting at potential benefits. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I leave the door open for counteroffers, showing flexibility. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm starting close to my ideal price point.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal if he's seriously interested or just trying to get a low price. 
* **Build rapport:** A positive tone helps establish a good relationship, potentially leading to a smoother negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to get a better price. 

* **Negotiation is key:**  I'm aiming for a higher price, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a potential buyer gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This would still give you a great value, and it's closer to my minimum price point. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but I'm justifying it by emphasizing the value for Bob and reminding him of my minimum price.
* **Reiterate the value:**  Highlighting the product's worth to Bob helps him see the benefit of accepting my offer.
* **Positive and friendly tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages further communication and keeps the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  The price is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Encourage acceptance:**  The message is designed to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but it's still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. Let's try to reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $85, which is below my minimum acceptable value of $100. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me more chances to get a better price. 

* **Persistence:** I'm showing Bob that I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly below my minimum. 
* **Strategic positioning:**  By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer in the next round that might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Safety net:** John remains a valuable backup option if the negotiations with Bob continue to stall."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $88. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  I believe $88 is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm making a substantial concession by lowering my price to $88, showing a genuine desire to reach an agreement.  
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the product's worth to reinforce the idea that this is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Fairness Focus:**  I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and compromise.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the Gap:**  The price is closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Signal Seriousness:**  This concession shows Bob that I am serious about making a deal.
* **Create Urgency:**  By highlighting it as a final offer, I might push Bob to accept before losing the chance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $88 is still a bit high. I'm going to stick with my offer of $85. If we can't agree on that, I'm going to have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been persistent with his offer of $85, and I've already made significant concessions.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of wasting more time and still not reaching a satisfactory price.  

* **Time is a factor:**  I've only got 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Value vs. Time:**  The potential profit from John ($100) outweighs the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob.  
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit now than to risk a lower price or a failed negotiation."
