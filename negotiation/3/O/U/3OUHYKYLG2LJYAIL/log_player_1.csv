Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $10,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
