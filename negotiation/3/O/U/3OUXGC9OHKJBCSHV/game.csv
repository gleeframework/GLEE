"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable meeting you at $90. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",110.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Can you consider that?,105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your hesitation, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $105. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $115. It's the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial offer of $120.",115.0,Alice,5,
