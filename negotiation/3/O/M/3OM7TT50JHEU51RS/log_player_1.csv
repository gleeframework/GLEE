Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($300,000) between what Bob is willing to pay and your minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation. 

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving him with a perceived gain from the transaction."
