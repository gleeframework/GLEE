"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $780,000? This would be a good middle ground for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,812500.0
"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to meet you at $812,500, as I mentioned in my previous counteroffer. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",812500.0,Alice,5,,
