"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
