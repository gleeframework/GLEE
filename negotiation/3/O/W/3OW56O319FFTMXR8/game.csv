"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still looking to keep my expenses within a certain limit. Could we possibly negotiate down to $16000?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to meet you at $17500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts, Alice, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly reach an agreement at $16500?",16500.0,Bob,6,
