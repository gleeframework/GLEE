"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the product's usefulness to emphasize its value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $140, I have space to lower the price if Bob counteroffers, allowing me to potentially close the deal within the 10 rounds. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While I'm starting negotiations with Bob, I'm also aware of the $150 offer from John. This acts as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $125. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $125 is significantly lower than my starting price and my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** While I could accept his offer, it's too low. Rejecting it allows me to continue negotiations and potentially reach a more profitable agreement.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  I'm counteroffering at $135, which is halfway between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $125. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone to encourage a successful negotiation.
* **Keeping Options Open:** By counteroffering, I'm still keeping the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $130. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This is a significant improvement from his previous offers.
* **Potential for Higher Offers:**  While I could reject and continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further. I'm risking losing this deal entirely and potentially missing out on other offers.
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers $150, there's a chance I might not be able to secure a better deal with him. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and guarantees me a profit, albeit a smaller one than I initially hoped for.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid the potential of a lengthy negotiation that might not yield a better result."
