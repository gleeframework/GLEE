Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also establishes the product's value in his mind.
* **Confident Tone:**  A confident tone can subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's worth. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects your initial price.  You can always lower your price, but you can't go higher. Keep in mind your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) during the negotiation."
