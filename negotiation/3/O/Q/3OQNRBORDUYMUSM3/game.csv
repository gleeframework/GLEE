"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get at least $180 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140, can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $160. Would you be willing to consider that?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $160. I'm willing to pay $145, can you meet me there?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm almost there, but I still need to make a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $155. Would you be willing to consider that?",155.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $155. I'm willing to pay $140, that's the lowest I can go. Can you meet me there?",140.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $155, as that's the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to hold out for that price, but I'm also aware that John is waiting to buy the product for $150. If you're not willing to meet me at $155, I'll have to consider other options.",155.0,Alice,9,
