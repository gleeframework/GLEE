"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $82? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible!  $82 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend right now.  How about $78? It's closer to what I'm aiming for, and I think it's a fair price considering we're both meeting halfway.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you $81, which is just a few dollars above your latest offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",81.0,Alice,5,
