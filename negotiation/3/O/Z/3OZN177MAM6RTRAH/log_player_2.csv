"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and sets a strong negotiating position.  A price of $1,200,000 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still within his budget and represents a substantial saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely Alice will come down further, so accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
