"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can do better.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a competitive price considering the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial offer, he can still potentially get a better deal. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and there's still a gap between their desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $9,750.  Would you consider $10,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's saved $2,000 from his initial budget of $12,000. While he could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  $10,000 is a good deal for Bob, and it's likely that Alice won't go much lower."
