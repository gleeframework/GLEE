"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a competitive price considering the value you'll be getting.",10250.0,Alice,3,
