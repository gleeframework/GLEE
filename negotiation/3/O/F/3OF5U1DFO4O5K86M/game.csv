"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $8,000 is below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the best I can do at this time.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference again and land at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, $9,500 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do.",11500.0,Alice,5,
