"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the previous offers we've discussed.",975000.0,Alice,5,
