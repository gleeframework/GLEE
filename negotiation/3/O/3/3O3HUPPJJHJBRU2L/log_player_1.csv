Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  This is a time-sensitive offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay significantly more than its worth to him. 
* **Sense of urgency:**  Adding a time constraint might encourage Bob to make a quick decision, potentially in your favor.
* **Justification of value:** While not revealing your minimum, you vaguely mention the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Based on Bob's reaction (if you get to interact further) you might negotiate down, but it's unlikely you'd go below $15,000 given your guaranteed sale to John."
