"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value, hoping to secure a good deal. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if I can get him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation, especially since I know John is willing to pay my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's value and closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to consider, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm also aware that John is a reliable backup, and I don't want to risk selling below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a further compromise, and it's just $500 above my minimum desired price. I believe this is a fair offer, considering Bob's previous counteroffers. I'm hoping he will accept and we can close the deal. However, if he rejects, I will be prepared to consider selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally met my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal. It was a bit of a back and forth, but I managed to negotiate a price I'm satisfied with."
