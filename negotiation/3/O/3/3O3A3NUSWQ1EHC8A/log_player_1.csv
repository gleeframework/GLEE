{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still below your minimum.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while giving you the chance to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is tempting, I need to recoup more of my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $140.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to recoup your costs, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a decision today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want.  I'm better off selling to John at $150 and ending this negotiation.  I've got a solid offer, and I don't want to risk losing both buyers."
