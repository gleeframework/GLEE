Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you are subtly anchoring Bob's perception of the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in a discussion and potentially counter-offer. 

While this strategy risks Bob rejecting the initial offer, it maximizes the potential profit. If Bob rejects it, you can always negotiate down or sell to John for your guaranteed price."
