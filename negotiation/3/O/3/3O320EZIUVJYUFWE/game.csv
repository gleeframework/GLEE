,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $13,000.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your position, the product is quite valuable, and $13,000 is too low for me.  Could you consider $17,000? It's a fair offer that reflects the true worth of this product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $15,000.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to move on to another option.",15000.0,Bob,4,
