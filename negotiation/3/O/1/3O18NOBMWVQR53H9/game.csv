"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm not comfortable with $11,500, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this brings us closer together and respects both our positions. I look forward to your consideration.",11000.0,Bob,4,
