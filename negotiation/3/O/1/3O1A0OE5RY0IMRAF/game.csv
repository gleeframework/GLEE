"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This would be a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I've attached to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. My counteroffer is $1,400,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a reasonable compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a good price for both of us, as it allows me to stay within my budget while also giving you a good return on your product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,380,000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I'm confident that this price still reflects the value of the product, but I'm willing to give you a bit of a discount to close the deal.",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to pay $1,360,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1360000.0,Bob,6,
