"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my expenses.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be realistic about my spending. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that I've already made a good offer at $9500, and I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this deal if you're not willing to meet me at that price. I'm considering buying the product from another seller who is willing to sell it to me for $8000.",9500.0,Bob,6,
