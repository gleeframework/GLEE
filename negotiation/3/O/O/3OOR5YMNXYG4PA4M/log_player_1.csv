"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $12,000, so I'm not setting the price too high initially to avoid immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  There are more rounds available, and I can potentially get closer to my desired $15,000 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the initial $16,000 to $15,500.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still staying above my minimum value of $15,000, demonstrating that I am committed to earning at least that much for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000. Even though Bob's offer is close, there are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not ready to accept less than $15,000 yet, and I'm confident I can get closer to that price by continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my offer again to $15,250. This is a small but significant decrease that shows I'm still willing to compromise. However, I'm keeping the price above $15,000 because I'm still aiming to maximize my profit. I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough to Bob to reach a deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to get closer to my desired price.  Bob's offer of $14,300 is still lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $15,000 and guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
