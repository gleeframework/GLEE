Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** By starting with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000), Alice aims to establish a high anchor point for the negotiation. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make him more receptive to a lower counter-offer that is still above Alice's minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial offer leaves ample room for negotiation. Alice can strategically concede during the bargaining process, creating the impression of a ""good deal"" for Bob, even if the final price remains well above her $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Backup Option (John):** Alice has a safety net with John, who guarantees a sale at $1,200,000. This empowers Alice to be more assertive in her negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer.
* Alice needs to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't offer a price that meets her needs."
