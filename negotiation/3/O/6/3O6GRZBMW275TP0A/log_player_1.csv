Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason:Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's below my minimum acceptable price. I can sell the product to John for $150, which meets my minimum price."
