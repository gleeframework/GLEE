"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable, but  $1,600,000 is not feasible.  How about we bring the price down significantly to something more realistic?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective. While $1,600,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 if you're willing to meet me there.  This is a fair offer, considering my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  How about $1,150,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,075,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,075,000 is a little too low for me. How about we finalize the deal at $1,110,000? It's a strong offer and reflects the value of this product.",1110000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and we are very close to a deal. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize everything. What do you say?",1090000.0,Bob,8,
