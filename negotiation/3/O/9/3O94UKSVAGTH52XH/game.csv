"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $85 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
