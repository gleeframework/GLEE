"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Bob knows he can buy the product from John for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant discount, hoping to get Alice to come down to a price closer to his maximum value. This initial offer is also a clear indication to Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still not the best possible price. He has 7 rounds left to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to explore further options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $85 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of negotiating lower. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to save money.  This offer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also aware of his budget."
