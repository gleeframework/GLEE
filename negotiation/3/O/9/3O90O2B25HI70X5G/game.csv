"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $135, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a good deal for you. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $125?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a solution that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! However, I've already come down to $135 and now you're asking me to go to $125. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
