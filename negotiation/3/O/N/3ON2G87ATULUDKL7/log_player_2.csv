"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting price of $100 is too high. We know we can get it for $120 from John, and ideally want to pay even less. By rejecting the offer, we open the door to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price and slightly above her value. This leaves room for negotiation but sets a target price closer to our desired range.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation tone.  We provide a reason (""too high for my budget"") without revealing our absolute maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than Alice's initial offer, we still have room to negotiate.  Alice is likely willing to go a bit lower, and we haven't reached a point where we'd be better off going with John's $120 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $87? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 87
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:** We are moving in smaller increments now ($2 instead of $5) to signal that we're getting closer to our limit. 
* **Target Price:**  $87 is a reasonable target - a decent saving for us, and likely still profitable for Alice.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and reiterates our desire to find a deal."
