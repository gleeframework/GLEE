"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even though the price is high. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Flexibility:** This opening offer leaves me the flexibility to negotiate further if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm not happy with his offer, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the process.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point. If I don't, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $850,000 just doesn't reflect its true value. I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which is a fair compromise given the exceptional quality of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Negotiating:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by offering a counter-proposal.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price point, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's high quality and value to justify the higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $875,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Improvement:** Although we're getting closer, there's still potential to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Uncertainty about John:** I'm not sure how long John's offer will remain valid. I don't want to rush into a deal with Bob just yet.

**Next Steps:** I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to push the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $875,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and go with $925,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language to keep the conversation amicable and encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Remaining Flexible:** I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'll meet you at $900,000, and that's my final offer. If you can accept this price, I'm willing to move forward with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he might not budge further, and I might end up with a deal below my minimum.
* **Secure Option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is the most secure and profitable option at this point.
* **Time Constraint:** With only four rounds left, there's a risk that I won't be able to achieve a better price with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, selling to John provides a guaranteed and favorable outcome, so I'm going to take that option."
