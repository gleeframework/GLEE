Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $75 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm still hopeful to get closer to my desired price point. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $80. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. It's also the same amount I can get from John, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
