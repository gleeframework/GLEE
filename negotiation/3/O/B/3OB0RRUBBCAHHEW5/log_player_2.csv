"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is your maximum price.  However, you can get the product from John for the same price. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  You can save yourself the effort of negotiating with Alice and simply go with John."
