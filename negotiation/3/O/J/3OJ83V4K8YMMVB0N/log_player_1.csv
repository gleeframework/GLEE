"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's better than selling to John. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I want. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it's the same amount I would get from John. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with him.  I'll accept his offer of $900,000."
