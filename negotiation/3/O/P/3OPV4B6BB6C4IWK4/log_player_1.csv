Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $130.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $130, you're aiming for a price that is significantly higher than your minimum but still attractive to Bob, as it's $20 less than his perceived value.

This strategy seeks to balance profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
