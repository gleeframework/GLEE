"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go.  I'm confident that I can get at least $8,000 from John if the negotiation fails, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get more. I'm still in a good position to negotiate with Bob, and I have the safety net of John's offer if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a slightly better price.  It's risky, but I think I have a good chance of getting closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  This is a more aggressive counteroffer, but I think it's still reasonable given Bob's previous offer. I'm getting closer to my minimum, and I'm hoping this will get Bob to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $8,000, and I'm only a few rounds away from potentially losing out to John's offer.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
