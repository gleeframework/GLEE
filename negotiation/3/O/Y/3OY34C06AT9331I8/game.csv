"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $100? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",105.0,Alice,7,
