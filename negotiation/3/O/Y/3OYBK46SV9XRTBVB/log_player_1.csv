**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently lowered his offer and seems firmly set at a price significantly lower than our $1,550,000 minimum.  It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer of $1,300,000 represents a $250,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. 

While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob won't budge, and we'd be forced to accept a lower offer or take John's deal anyway.  It's more strategic to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John now."
