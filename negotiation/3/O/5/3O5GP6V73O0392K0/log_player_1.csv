"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum price point of $120. I know that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. If not, I can always sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $110. This is still above what Bob offered, but it's closer to the middle ground. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I'm running out of time, but I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $105. This is a significant compromise, but I think it's a fair offer considering Bob's previous offers and the limited rounds remaining. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept and we can finally close this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the best we've gotten so far and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Although it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to accept it to avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
