"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My initial price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a reasonable range, given that the product is worth $100 to Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that I am open to negotiation, which can make Bob more likely to counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** My initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling like I'm being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I can likely get a better price than $120 by continuing the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $145? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is still friendly and maintains a collaborative tone.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm framing the counter offer as a fair price for both of us, which could make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $145 leaves room for Bob to counter again, giving us more opportunities to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation room:** There's still some wiggle room to potentially get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **John's offer as backup:** I have the security of John's offer for $150, allowing me to continue negotiating with Bob without immediate financial pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's try $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good step towards finding a deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive and Collaborative:**  The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone.
* **Last Chance for Negotiation:** I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price while leaving room for one more counteroffer from Bob before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I still think I can do better. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited time:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are slim.
* **John's offer guarantees profit:**  Selling to John for $150 ensures I get a price that meets my minimum and guarantees a profit. 

While I'd ideally like to get a better price, maximizing my profit in the short term outweighs the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
