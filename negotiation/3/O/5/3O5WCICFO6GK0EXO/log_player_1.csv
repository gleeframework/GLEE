Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential benefits this product offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a substantial amount considering my own assessment. I believe this demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are too far below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that justifies continuing the negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit."
