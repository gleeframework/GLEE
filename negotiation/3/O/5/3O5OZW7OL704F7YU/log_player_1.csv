Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, which is slightly above the product's value to Bob. This gives him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum price and closer to my desired range. This gives Bob some room to negotiate without drastically cutting into my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject it and continue negotiating to try and secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

This is my minimum price. It's important to note that I can always sell the product to John for this price, so there's no risk in sticking to my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will accept it and I can close the deal."
