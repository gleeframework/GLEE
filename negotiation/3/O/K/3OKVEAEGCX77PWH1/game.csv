"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $100?  That gives us both some room to make a deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
