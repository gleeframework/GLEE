It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  Even if the negotiation fails, you can still buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, as it splits the difference between Alice's price and your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price considering your maximum budget of $120. It's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly better deal, and you risk losing the product entirely if Alice decides to stop negotiating."
