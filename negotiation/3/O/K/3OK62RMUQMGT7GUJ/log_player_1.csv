Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strategic positioning:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to create a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""let me know your thoughts"" signals a willingness to negotiate. 

This approach aims to maximize potential profit while still leaving room to secure a deal with Bob before resorting to your backup option."
