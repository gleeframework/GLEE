Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a good price for the product, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not yet ready to settle for that. I'd like to see if I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with my counteroffer.  This keeps the negotiation moving and gives me a chance to get closer to my ideal price without risking him walking away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and it's likely the best I'll get from him.  I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since I can always sell to John for $12,000."
