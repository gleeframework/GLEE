Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my absolute maximum is $105.  If you're willing to go that low, we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at a price that's closer to your maximum. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above my maximum budget of $100. While we've gotten closer, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  I'm better off buying from John for $100 and ensuring I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
