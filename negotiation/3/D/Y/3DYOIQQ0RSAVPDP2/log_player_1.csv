"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price of $900,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob highlights the potential benefit for him, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to keep Bob engaged.  By offering a high price, I can gauge his interest while leaving room to potentially settle for a price closer to $800,000.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $750,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price. Accepting it would mean selling the product at a loss compared to selling to John. 

**Strategy:**

I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to push for a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and explore if we can find a mutually agreeable price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't accept your current offer, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also being closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Price:**  $850,000 is a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Urgency:**  Emphasizing the need to finalize the deal creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

I aim to maintain a firm but reasonable stance.  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I will reassess my options, keeping John's offer as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Accepting it ensures I don't lose out on this sale and allows me to secure the value I need for the product. 

**Strategy:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob's offer is already at my minimum threshold.  Accepting it guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a rejection that would force me to sell to John."
