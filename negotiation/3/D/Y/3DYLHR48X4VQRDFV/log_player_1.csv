Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $150 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A price ending in '50' can sometimes feel more appealing and less ""rounded"" to a buyer. 
 
It's important to note that this is just one strategy. Depending on the context and any additional information about Bob's negotiation style, a different approach might be more effective."
