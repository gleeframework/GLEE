"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial adjustment that reflects my desire to make a deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap between our valuations.  To be frank, I have other options. I'm willing to go to $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,650,000?  This is a substantial move on my part, and it demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's still more than I'm comfortable with.  I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
