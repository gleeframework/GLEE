"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin significantly above both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes a collaborative approach to finding a price that works for both parties. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This high initial offer aims to:
    * Anchor the negotiation at a high point.
    * Potentially reveal information about Bob's budget or how much he values the product based on his counteroffer. 

We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests:

* **Bob has room to move:** He's likely starting low to test our bottom line.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Even though his offer is low, it indicates a willingness to engage in the negotiation process.

We are better off rejecting this offer and providing a counteroffer in the next round to steer the negotiation towards a more agreeable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial adjustment that reflects my desire to make a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Controlled Concession:** We decrease our price by $400,000, showing willingness to negotiate but also demonstrating that we're serious about a price that reflects the product's value. 
* **Justification:** We anchor our counteroffer by reiterating the product's value and emphasizing the significant reduction we're offering.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

We are aiming to find a middle ground quickly, but are prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to make a reasonable offer.  We still have the option to sell to John for our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap between our valuations.  To be frank, I have other options. I'm willing to go to $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, $900,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. His mention of ""other options"" could be a negotiating tactic, but it also highlights the potential risk of holding out for too long. 

We need to show Bob we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of undervaluing the product. Rejecting his offer allows us to counter with a more reasonable price while gauging his seriousness in the next round.  We're getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option if Bob doesn't show significant movement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,650,000?  This is a substantial move on my part, and it demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're making a significant move to signal flexibility and a desire to close the deal. By proposing $1,650,000, we're splitting the difference between our last offer and his, showing good faith in the negotiation.
* **Strong Justification:** We're highlighting the value proposition again and emphasizing the significant concession we're making to incentivize Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We're moving closer to our fallback option of selling to John. By phrasing our message with a sense of urgency (""let's get this deal done""), we encourage Bob to respond seriously.

We're hoping this offer entices Bob while still remaining above our acceptable minimum. It's a calculated risk, but with time running out, we need to see significant movement from his side to justify continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's still more than I'm comfortable with.  I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has stalled at $1,000,000, which is his perceived value but significantly below our minimum of $1,500,000.  His language (""absolute limit"") suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. 

Crucially, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  

Continuing negotiations with Bob risks:

* **Lower final price:**  Even if we get Bob closer to our minimum, it's unlikely to be significantly more than John's offer.
* **Wasting time:**  We have limited rounds, and every round spent on Bob is a missed opportunity to secure a deal with John.

Therefore, it makes the most strategic sense to cut our losses with Bob and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
