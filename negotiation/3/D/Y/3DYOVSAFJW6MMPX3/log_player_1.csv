"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price. I have 8 more rounds, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not comfortable going above $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and is getting closer to my desired price.  While I would ideally like to get closer to $11,500, I'm worried that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer of $10,000.  It's better to take a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal altogether."
