Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still making a significant profit.  I'm confident that I can get at least $1,500,000 from John if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for such a significant loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still significantly more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counteroffers again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long, drawn-out process.  John offers a guaranteed, high price, and I'm not willing to lose out on that potential profit."
