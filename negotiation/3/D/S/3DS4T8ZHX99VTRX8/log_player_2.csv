"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is a significant markup from your maximum price. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 reflects a fairer deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer now matches your maximum price. There's no point in risking further negotiation or going with John since you won't get a better price."
