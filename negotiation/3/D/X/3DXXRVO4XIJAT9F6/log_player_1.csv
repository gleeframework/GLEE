Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,500,000 baseline. You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, and continuing to negotiate with Bob has a higher risk with potentially diminishing returns.  It's strategically wiser to take the guaranteed deal with John."
