Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $12,000 is less than the $15,000 the product is worth to Bob, making the offer appealing to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly, but still aim to get close to your target price.

This strategy allows you to potentially maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and likely leaves room for further negotiation.  You've already established a higher price point, and rejecting his offer allows you to maintain that leverage. 

**Next Steps:**

You will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your desired $12,000.  You could propose a compromise like $11,000, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still protecting your profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above your desired minimum.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob reinforces his motivation to reach an agreement.
* **Open Communication:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to consider your offer.

This approach aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a deal closer to your initial goal of $12,000."
