"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That way we can both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $100 for the product. This is the maximum I am willing to spend, and I hope it aligns with your minimum price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to sell now and ensure I get at least my minimum price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher offer, and I risk losing the sale entirely."
