"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  Mentioning ""fair price"" and ""value it brings"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I am willing to pay up to $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  While Bob has come down from his initial valuation, his offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially get closer to my target price. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, there's a chance I could secure a better deal with Bob if I continue to negotiate.  It's worth trying to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's see if we can close this gap."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while explaining why it's still not acceptable. I'm justifying my counteroffer by highlighting the significant reduction from my initial price.
* **Show Commitment:**  Stating my commitment to finding a solution demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Closing the Gap:** Emphasizing ""closing the gap"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000 for the product. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it will be beneficial for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,550,000 meets my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will reject the counteroffer, and I might end up having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
