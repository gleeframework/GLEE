{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's offer is above his maximum budget, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Bob can get a better deal with Alice or buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob wants to save as much as possible and sees potential to further negotiate with Alice. There's a chance he can secure a better deal or fall back to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's latest offer but still below his maximum budget. This shows he is willing to negotiate but also sticking to his goal of saving money. By offering $8200, he's showing he's serious about buying the product but also leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,400 is now within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  While he could continue to try and negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will become less willing to negotiate or that he might end up paying more by going back and forth.  It's a reasonable price, and he can still save money compared to buying from John."
