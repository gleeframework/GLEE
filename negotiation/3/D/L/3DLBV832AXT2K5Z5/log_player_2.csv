"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to the right person.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get the price down further.  A counteroffer will allow Bob to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product for that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  At this point, Bob is better off accepting the offer and getting the product for a lower price than going with John and paying the full $15,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better price, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high."
