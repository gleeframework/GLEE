"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but also signaling that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $10,500, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm still hopeful that I can convince Bob to pay closer to $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not giving away the product for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price, which is the same as what John is offering.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, and I risk losing more time. It's better to secure the sale to John now and avoid the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that might not lead to a better price."
