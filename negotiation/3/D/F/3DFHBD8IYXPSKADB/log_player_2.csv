Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and at this point, saving the extra $200 by buying from John is the most logical decision."
