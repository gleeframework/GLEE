"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I believe this product has tremendous value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
