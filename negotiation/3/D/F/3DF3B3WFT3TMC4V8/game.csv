"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can work together to find a price that suits both parties.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This price reflects the value it holds for me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value it holds for you, and I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product.  This is a fair price that gives you a good return while staying within my budget.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value it holds for you, and I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
