Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $120. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  This ensures you have a way to get the product if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price significantly:**  A $20 drop from Alice's offer is a substantial reduction. 
* **Reasonable starting point:**  $100 is still within your budget and allows for potential negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $130 is still more than you'd like to pay.
* **More room for negotiation.**  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, which suggests there's still potential to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is still a backup.**  You haven't lost anything by rejecting Alice's offer, and you still have the option of buying from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

{""product_price"": 110}
```

* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your last offer and Alice's latest offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her previous offer, $135 is still more than you'd like to pay.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you have several rounds left to try and get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You haven't lost anything by rejecting Alice's offer, and you still have the option of buying from John if the negotiation fails."

{""product_price"": 120}
```

* **Balancing your budget:**  $120 is still a good deal for you, but it's pushing your budget limit.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only four rounds left, this offer gives Alice a final chance to agree before you consider buying from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

* **Minimizing risk:** Buying from John guarantees you the product at a price within your budget, avoiding the risk of further negotiation failures."
