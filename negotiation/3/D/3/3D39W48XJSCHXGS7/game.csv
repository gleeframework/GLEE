"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a little hesitant at $11,000.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the sale.  Let's make this happen!",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
