``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate down.  I'll see if Bob is interested at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it immediately. I believe I can get a higher price from Bob if I push a little further. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price considering my minimum is $15,000. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

Bob has come up to $16,000, which is only $1,000 below my initial offer. This is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
