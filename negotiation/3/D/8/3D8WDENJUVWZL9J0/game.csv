"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $1,050,000. I'd like to start with a counteroffer of that amount. I believe this reflects the fair market value while still allowing you a healthy profit margin.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly unique and significantly exceeds $1,050,000. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,120,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's inherent worth.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,120,000 remains above my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,075,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is a serious proposal. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While your offer is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this offer represents a significant concession on my part while maintaining a reasonable valuation.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,090,000. This is a serious offer and I believe it's fair to both of us, reflecting the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
