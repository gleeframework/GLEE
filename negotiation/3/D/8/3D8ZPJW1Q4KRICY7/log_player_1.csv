"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high with an offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to accept just yet. I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,600,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than his offer, and it leaves room for further negotiation.  I hope to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to push for even higher, I want to avoid risking a deal falling through completely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale above my minimum and prevents me from losing out on a potential profit."
