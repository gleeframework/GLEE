Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've set the price at $925,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving you significant leverage in negotiations.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, but you also want to avoid being too greedy and risking Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price,  still ensuring you get significantly more than your $800,000 baseline from John. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses confident language to emphasize the value of the product and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
