"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,000? That gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,
