"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is below my minimum price point, and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I want to see if we can negotiate a price closer to my value of $12,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,000? That gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $10,000 is the most I can afford. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price.  Let's see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. I think this is the maximum I can afford, and I'd be happy to do business at this price. Can you accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not convinced Bob will go any higher, and I've already made some concessions. To guarantee I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's not worth risking a deal with a guaranteed buyer."
