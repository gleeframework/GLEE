(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's a lot of room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting the offer and trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer, aiming to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  This aggressive strategy is risky but could potentially lead to a big discount if Alice is eager to sell."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'm comfortable with, but it's moving in the right direction. I'm not yet ready to accept, but I'm going to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $300,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still aiming for a good deal.  It's a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible, or we might run out of rounds before reaching an agreement.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product, as continuing might lead to a worse outcome."
