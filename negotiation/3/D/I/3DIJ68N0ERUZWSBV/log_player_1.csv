Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $90. I think you'll find it's worth the value, as I know it's something you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** I want to maximize my profit, and Bob is willing to pay $100. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I could start at $100, offering $90 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal if he accepts right away. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  If Bob rejects, I'm not losing out as I have John who will buy it for $80."
