"Alice, your initial price is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a little above my comfort zone. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This offer is close to my limit, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're really close now, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. Can you meet me at this price?",13000.0,Alice,7,
