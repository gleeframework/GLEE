Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to be flexible.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $120.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $100. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $102.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. If this doesn't work for you, I'll be moving on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a sale, but I'm afraid I can only go up to $100. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've made several counteroffers, but Bob is not budging. It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
