"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $8,900.  This is a significant drop from my original offer and represents my final compromise.",8900.0,Alice,5,
