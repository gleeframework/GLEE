# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:** Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, but you know your own valuation is lower. This suggests she's inflating the perceived value to push the price higher.
* **John provides a fallback:**  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. This means Alice's offer needs to be significantly better to be worthwhile.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. This opens the door for her to come back with a lower offer closer to her own valuation of $1,200,000."
