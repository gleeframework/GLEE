Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on $12,000, but that's still a bit too high for me.  I can go up to $11,500. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'm not going to budge from that price. I'm starting to think that we're not going to reach an agreement, and I might have to consider other options... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. Alice is firm on her price, and while Bob could continue negotiating, the chances of her lowering her price are slim.  He's already spent several rounds and the remaining rounds are dwindling. Buying from John ensures he gets the product at his target price and avoids further negotiation."
