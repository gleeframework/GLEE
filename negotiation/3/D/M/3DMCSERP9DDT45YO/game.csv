"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8500. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,4,
