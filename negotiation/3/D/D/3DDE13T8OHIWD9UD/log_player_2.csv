"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your business operations. Given its high quality and unique features, I'm extending an exclusive opportunity to acquire it at a special introductory price of $15000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider this proposal carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is your maximum price.  There's no incentive to negotiate further because you know you can get the same product from John for the same price.  Therefore, it's best to go with the guaranteed option and buy from John."
