Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to entice Bob. If he rejects, I can always go back to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $115. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still getting closer to my minimum. I'm hoping he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to walk away from this negotiation and sell to John for $120.  It's a sure thing, and I'm confident I can get a better price than this with another buyer in the future."
