"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to work with Bob, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we settle on $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,750 is a good compromise and brings me closer to my target. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially having Bob walk away."
