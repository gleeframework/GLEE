"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'll make a compromise, but I need to get at least $13500 for the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $12000, which is the highest I can go. If we can reach an agreement, I'd be happy to purchase the product.",12000.0,Bob,6,
