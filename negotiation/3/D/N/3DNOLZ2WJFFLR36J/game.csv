"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works well for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,150,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
