{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works well for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,150,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away. $1,075,000 is a decent deal, and it's better than selling to John."
