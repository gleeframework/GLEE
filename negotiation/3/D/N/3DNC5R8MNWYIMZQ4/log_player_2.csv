"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $13,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you can likely get a better price by rejecting her initial offer.  You have the backup option of buying from John at $15,000, so you're not at risk of losing the product entirely."
