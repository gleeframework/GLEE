"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you value highly. Given its unique benefits, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is above your maximum budget and leaves you with a minimal saving compared to John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with purchasing from John for $1,000,000."
