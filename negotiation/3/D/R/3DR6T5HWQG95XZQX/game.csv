"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident the product's value lies above your offered price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $1,275,000. This is the highest I can go right now.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,290,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,5,
