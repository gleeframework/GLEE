You have three options:

You don't know if Alice is willing to go lower. It's worth trying to negotiate to see if you can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm open to negotiation. How about we split the difference at $90? Let me know what you think!

While $90 is a better price than $100, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price of $80."
