{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why:

* **Reasoning:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to try and maximize profit.  
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting potential value to Bob.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation (""What do you think?"")

Let me know if you want me to adjust the offer or message based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the [product name], but $100 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider $80? I'm happy to discuss further if that's not quite right. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because my minimum acceptable price is $80.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to sell it for my minimum right away. I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. 

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm open to negotiation. How about we split the difference at $90? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a higher price:**  I'm still aiming for a price higher than my minimum ($80) but acknowledging Bob's budget.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and open approach, encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice!  $90 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $85? That would be a great compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Close to my minimum:** $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for higher offers:** While I would have liked to get closer to $90, Bob is clearly not willing to go higher.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, I risk him walking away completely.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round.

Selling to Bob for $85 is a good outcome, considering my minimum and the potential for a more drawn-out negotiation."
