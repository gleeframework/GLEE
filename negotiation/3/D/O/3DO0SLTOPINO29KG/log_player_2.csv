**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, while also giving you a good deal. Let's try to reach a compromise.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's ideal price. Bob can likely secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. The gap between Alice's price and Bob's target is narrowing, so it's still worth trying for a lower price."
