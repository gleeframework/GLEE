"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can reach a more favorable price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I receive a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While tempting, I won't accept Bob's offer of $11,500. It's still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already shown a willingness to compromise, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll continue to engage with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting a great deal.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm making another concession by lowering my price, but I'm staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to meet Bob halfway while ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and there's a strong chance we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed profit, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
