{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still a $2,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a fair opening price:** It shows you're willing to negotiate while still valuing your product. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. Good luck!"
