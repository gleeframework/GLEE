Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Potential for higher profit:**  A starting price of $1,200,000 gives you room for negotiation while aiming for a 50% profit margin.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while considering the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
