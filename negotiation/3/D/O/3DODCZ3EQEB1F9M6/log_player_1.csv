Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring I make a profit above my minimum value of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to sell at that price immediately. I'll counter with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. I'm hoping to meet in the middle and find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than my last counteroffer, and it's above my minimum value.  I'm willing to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
