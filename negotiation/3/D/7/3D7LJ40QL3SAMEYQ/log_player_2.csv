Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $70. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we meet at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.

While Alice is coming closer to my budget, she's still unlikely to reach my $80 limit.  I can get the product for my target price from John without further negotiation."
