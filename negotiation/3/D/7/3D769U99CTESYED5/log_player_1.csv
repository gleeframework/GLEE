"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $9,750. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a decent profit for me, and I believe Bob might be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. I'm willing to go down to this price, as it's only slightly below my initial offer and still a decent profit for me.  I think this might be a good compromise and that Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum, I've already gone through several rounds and it seems like Bob is firm on his price.  It's better to secure a deal now rather than risk losing out to John or having the negotiation drag on further."
