"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $95, which is a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $100 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
