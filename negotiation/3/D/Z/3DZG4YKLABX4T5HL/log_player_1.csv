"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, and hopefully, it will pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering the product at $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to get Bob closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'll counter Bob again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm going to try one more time to reach a deal with Bob. I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000, but this is my final offer. If he doesn't accept, I'm going to sell to John."

I've reached the point where I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm willing to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I at least get my minimum price."
