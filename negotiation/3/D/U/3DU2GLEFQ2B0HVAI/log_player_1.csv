"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it has the potential to be hugely beneficial for you, even more than my initial asking price of $2,300,000 reflects.  What are your initial thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This achieves a few things:
    * **Anchoring:**  It sets a high initial reference point for the negotiation.
    * **Room to Negotiate:**  It provides space for me to make concessions and still reach a favorable outcome.
    * **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  His reaction will give me insight into how badly he wants the product.
* **Justification:** I'm hinting at the product's value beyond just the price, suggesting there are benefits Bob might not be fully aware of yet. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  This encourages Bob to engage in discussion rather than just giving a yes/no answer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's, it's still significantly below my target. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  His statement about meeting ""halfway"" suggests he might be willing to go higher than his initial offer. I'll make a counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up.  While that offer is closer to the mark, I need to be realistic about this product's value.  How about we land at $1,950,000? That's a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The new price is above the midpoint between our last offers, anchoring the negotiation closer to my desired range.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing this as a ""compromise"" to encourage Bob to reciprocate with movement on his side. 
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  By making a strong counteroffer, I'm aiming to avoid a protracted back-and-forth that could waste valuable rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, a good sign that he's invested in the negotiation. While $1,700,000 is better than John's offer, I believe there's still room to push for a higher price.  I'll make another counteroffer, but be cautious about pushing too hard too fast."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up again.  That said, $1,700,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line.  To make this work for me, I'd need to see $1,825,000.  I'm confident that at that price, this will be a highly profitable investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** My counteroffer is a smaller jump than Bob's, signaling that we're getting closer to my limit.
* **Framing:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is about *my* bottom line, not just an arbitrary number.
* **Reassurance:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to reinforce that this is a good deal, even at a higher price. 
* **Urgency:** With fewer rounds left, I'm subtly increasing the pressure to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has made a relatively substantial jump from his previous offer, indicating serious interest. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, the risk of Bob walking away increases.
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,750,000 is a significant profit margin, even if it's not my absolute ideal. 

It's time to secure a good deal rather than risking the negotiation falling apart for a slightly higher amount."
