"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for some room to negotiate if Bob is interested. It also signals that I believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum value, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $18,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking."

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting his offer of $16,000 is the best option to maximize my earnings at this point."
