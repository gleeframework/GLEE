"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a little too high for me. How about $87? It's a fair price for both of us and closer to what I'm looking to pay.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $89.  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",89.0,Alice,5,
