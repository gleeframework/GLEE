"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're looking to save as much as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy. You can try to get a better price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to save as much as possible.  You can likely get the price down further.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a little too high for me. How about $87? It's a fair price for both of us and closer to what I'm looking to pay."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $89.  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. At this point, accepting the offer for $89 is a good compromise and allows you to save some money compared to buying from John. It's worth noting that you only have 5 rounds left, so there's a risk of not reaching a deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
