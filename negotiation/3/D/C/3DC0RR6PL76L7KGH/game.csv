"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $925000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your willingness to pay a fair price. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000.  This price is fair and allows us both to make a good deal.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $850000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $880000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your willingness to pay a fair price. Let me know what you think.",880000.0,Alice,5,
