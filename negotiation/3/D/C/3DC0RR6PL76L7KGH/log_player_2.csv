"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $850000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $880000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering the product for $880,000. This represents a significant savings for you.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth the time.** While you might be able to squeeze out another $10,000 or $20,000, it's likely that the negotiation will become more drawn out and potentially frustrating. 
* **You're already saving a substantial amount.**  Accepting the offer will save you $320,000 compared to buying from John.

It's a good idea to take the deal and secure the product at a price that's within your range and saves you a significant amount of money."
