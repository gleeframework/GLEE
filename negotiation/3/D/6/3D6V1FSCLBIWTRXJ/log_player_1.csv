Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $200. This gives me a potential profit of $50, which is better than selling it to John for $150.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a chance. If he rejects the offer, I can always fall back to selling it to John."
