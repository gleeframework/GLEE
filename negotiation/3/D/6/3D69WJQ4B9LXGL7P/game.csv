"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $175 was a bit high.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $145. Let me know what you think!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $137.50, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $142.50?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",142.5,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",125.0,Bob,6,
