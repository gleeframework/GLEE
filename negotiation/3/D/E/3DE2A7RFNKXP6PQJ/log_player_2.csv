**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and seems unlikely to budge much from her $14,000 offer. While she says it's her ""final offer,"" experienced negotiators know that's rarely true. However, the potential savings from haggling further with Alice are shrinking and might not be worth the risk of her walking away.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000.  It's better to take the sure win and save $4,000 than to gamble on potentially saving a little more with Alice."
