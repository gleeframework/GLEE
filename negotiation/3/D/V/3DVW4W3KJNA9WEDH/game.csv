"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal as well. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to be careful with my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
