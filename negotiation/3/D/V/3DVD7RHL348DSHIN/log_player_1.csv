Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. How about $850,000? This still allows you to gain by selling above the other potential buyer, while also being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
