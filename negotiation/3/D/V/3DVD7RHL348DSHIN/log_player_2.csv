# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $950,000?  This would still leave you with a good amount of value and allows me to maximize my earnings. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.
