"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. How about $850,000? This still allows you to gain by selling above the other potential buyer, while also being within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $950,000?  This would still leave you with a good amount of value and allows me to maximize my earnings. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not entirely comfortable with $950,000, I think we're getting close. How about $925,000? This still leaves you with a good profit margin and keeps the transaction within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,
