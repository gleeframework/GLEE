"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $22,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $22,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range considering your maximum budget. It shows you're serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can let it go for.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget of $8,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a better price. I still have 7 rounds left, and I believe there's room to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that you're still interested in buying the product, but you're also determined to get a good price.  It's a significant increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise.  You're still well below Alice's offer, and you have more rounds to try and find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to wrap this up. How about we settle on $16,000? It's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, $16,000 is still too high. You have enough rounds left to continue negotiating. You can try a counteroffer closer to your limit to see if she's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still aiming for a lower price. I can offer you $14,000. I'm hoping we can close this deal soon."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a small increase from your previous counteroffer, showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product and getting closer to a deal. It also leaves room for further negotiation, as you're still well within your budget."
