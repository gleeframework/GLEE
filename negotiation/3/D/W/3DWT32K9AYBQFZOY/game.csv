"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I've put into this product. I can do better than $9000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I can do $11200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000, but I'm willing to give you a bit of a discount for being a serious buyer.",11200.0,Alice,5,
