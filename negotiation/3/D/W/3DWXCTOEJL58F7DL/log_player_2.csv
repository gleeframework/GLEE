"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, and there's no reason to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but my budget is $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,000? This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what he's willing to pay, and he's already secured a deal with John for the price he wants.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
