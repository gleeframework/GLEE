"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is important to you. I'd like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the market value and the condition of the product, I would like to propose a price of $11000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While $11,000 is closer to my target, I believe I can still push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 still feels a bit low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500?  It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Respectfully, Alice, I believe $11500 might still be a bit high given current market conditions and the condition of the product. Would you consider $11000 as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $10,000, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go any higher.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale."
