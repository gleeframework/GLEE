"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $12000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still more than he's willing to pay.  He has a better option with John, and it's worth seeing if he can get a better price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a great deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her original offer, it's still higher than his target price of $8,000. It's worth seeing if he can get a better deal with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. This is a great deal for both of us, and it lets me stay within my own financial needs.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, it's still above his limit. Since he has a guaranteed option with John, it's worth seeing if he can get Alice down to his target price or something closer."
