Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $12,000 on it. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
