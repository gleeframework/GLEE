"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on a price of $105? I think that's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100. It's a fair price for both of us and avoids me having to go elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $110. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $110? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
