You can get the product for $90 from Alice or $120 from John. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

You are willing to pay $85 and Alice is offering $92.  It's still worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice is asking for $95, which is getting close to John's price of $120.  At this point, it's better to go with John and save yourself the hassle of further negotiation."
