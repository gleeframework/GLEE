"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be happy to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $92 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $88, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
