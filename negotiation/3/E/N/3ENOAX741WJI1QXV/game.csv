"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you be willing to go up to $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $8,500. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'd agree once you have it.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, and I am serious about buying it. However, my budget is firm at $8,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
