Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $900,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $962,500? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $995,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This feels like a fair price considering our previous discussions, and I believe this is the final offer I can make.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored below $1,000,000 and is moving in small increments. While $975,000 is a substantial sum, holding out for the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John makes more sense. The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to offset the $225,000 difference."
