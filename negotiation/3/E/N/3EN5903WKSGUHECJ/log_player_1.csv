{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me leverage.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing flexibility and encouraging a back-and-forth.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've earned $175 and the negotiation is complete.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **Stalemate:** If we can't agree, I'll sell to John for $150 to ensure I don't lose any money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's willing to negotiate.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I can try to reach a price closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is higher than $80 but still lower than my initial offer of $175. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while maintaining my profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($80). This shows a willingness to compromise and increases the chance of reaching an agreement.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and worth the price, encouraging him to consider the counteroffer.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking Bob for his opinion, inviting further discussion and potentially leading to a quicker agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  The negotiation is successful, and I've earned $125.
* **Bob Rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.
* **Stalemate:** If we can't agree, I will sell to John for $150 to ensure I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $80 is a bit low.  How about $95? That's closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for improvement. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John for $150 would guarantee a profit, but I want to maximize my earnings if possible.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $95 but lower than my previous offer of $125. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while maintaining my profit margin."
