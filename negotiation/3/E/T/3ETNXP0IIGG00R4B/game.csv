"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. However, I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually agreeable price point.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,000,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 falls quite a bit short of what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe there's room for compromise. I would like to counter with a price of $1,400,000. This still represents a significant investment for me, but I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
