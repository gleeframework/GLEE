{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, which might make him more inclined to accept. 

**Note:** This is just the first offer.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the overall negotiation dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000.

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,000,000?  This is a fair price considering its value to you and allows me to meet my minimum requirements. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing willingness to compromise.
* **Splitting the difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between our previous offers. This signals my willingness to negotiate but maintains a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Value to Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to encourage him to accept the offer. 

**Note:**  I'm willing to negotiate further if needed, but I won't go below my minimum price. If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John to avoid further time-consuming negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another offer of $950,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, further negotiations could potentially lead to a lower price. It's not worth risking further price reductions when I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay my desired price.

Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me the best possible outcome and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
