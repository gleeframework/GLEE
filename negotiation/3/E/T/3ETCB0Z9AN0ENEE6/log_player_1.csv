Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a little closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe the product is worth more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm aware that I have 10 rounds, I'm hoping that by holding firm on my price, I can either get Bob to budge, or at least ensure that I don't lose out on potentially getting a better offer from him in the future."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. My last offer was $16,500.  I'm still willing to come down a bit, but I'm firm on $16,000.  This is a fair price for the value the product offers. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $15,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm realizing that Bob might not be willing to go higher.  At $15,500, I'm still getting a better price than what John would pay, and it's within a reasonable range. It's important to balance my desire to maximize profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
