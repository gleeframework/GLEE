Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested parties. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $19,000."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows for some negotiation room if Bob tries to haggle. He might be willing to pay slightly more than his perceived value of $12,000, especially if he believes it's a good deal. 
* **Maintain Value Perception:** Offering it at a significantly lower price to Bob might make him question the product's value. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward during negotiations with Bob if needed. However, remember your bottom line is $15,000. If Bob isn't willing to meet or exceed that after some discussion, you're better off selling to John."
