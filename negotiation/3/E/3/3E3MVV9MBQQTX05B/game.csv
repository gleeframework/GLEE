"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'd like to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. It's my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to negotiation.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000 either. I can meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair compromise that lets us both get a good deal.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $17,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it.",17000.0,Alice,5,
