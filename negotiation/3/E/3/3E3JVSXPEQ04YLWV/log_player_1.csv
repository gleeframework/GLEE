Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $10,500 yet. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I still have time to negotiate with Bob. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12,250? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12250}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle. I'm confident that I can get a better price if I keep negotiating.  Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I'm still aiming higher."
