"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details.  Otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She knows the product is only worth $8,000 to her and wants to maximize her profit. While $9,500 is less than your maximum price, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting her offer. This will push Alice to potentially lower her price or allow you to buy from John at your maximum price of $10,000."
