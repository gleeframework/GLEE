"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this proposal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, I'm confident the product's inherent value and long-term potential justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still feel that $1,150,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
