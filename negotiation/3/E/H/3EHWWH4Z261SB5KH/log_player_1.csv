Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm looking to sell it for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I'm starting the negotiation with Bob at a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $10,000 offer gives Bob room to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still exceeding my minimum price.
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, hoping to justify the higher price point. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
