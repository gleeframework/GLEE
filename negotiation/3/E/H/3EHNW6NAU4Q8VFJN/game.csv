"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in the product.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. This represents a significant discount from your initial offer and is a price I believe reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's find common ground.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
