"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer is the best choice for Bob. He saves $100,000 compared to buying from John, and avoids further negotiation."
