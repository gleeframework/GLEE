Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider at this time.  However, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?
