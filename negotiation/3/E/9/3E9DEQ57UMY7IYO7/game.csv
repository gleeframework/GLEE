"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. To be frank, I'm considering another offer closer to $750,000.  If you're willing to work in that range, I think we can close this deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're very close, and I appreciate you working with me.  However, to be completely transparent, $775,000 is still pushing the limits of what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $762,500.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm prepared to close the deal immediately at that price. ",762500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000. This is as close to your offer as I can get, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",765000.0,Alice,7,
