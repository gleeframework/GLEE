Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation, especially if he perceives the product as valuable or rare.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and scarcity (""before I list it publicly"", ""highly beneficial""). This creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high price provides a buffer for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can gradually lower the price while staying above our minimum of $15,000.

**Important:**

* **John as Backup:** It's crucial to remember that we have a guaranteed buyer in John. This gives us leverage in negotiations with Bob. We're not desperate to make the sale at any cost.
* **Observing Bob's Response:** Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give us valuable information about his willingness to pay. Based on his response, we can adjust our approach in further interactions."
