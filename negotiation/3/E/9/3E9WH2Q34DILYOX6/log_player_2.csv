"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  $800,000 is a significant discount, but it's still a large amount of money. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price.
* **I have time to negotiate.**  I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to reject this offer and see if Alice is willing to come down further.
* **John's offer is my fallback.**  If the negotiations with Alice fail, I can always go with John. This gives me leverage during the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and it gives you a healthy profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and it's a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to her original price than mine.** She's only moved down $20,000 from her initial $800,000 offer.
* **I still have time to negotiate.**  I'm still in the early rounds and have plenty of time to try and get a lower price.
* **John is still my fallback.**  This keeps the pressure on Alice to make a more significant concession.

**Next Move:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my previous offer of $700,000, hoping to split the difference and find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $820,000.  How about we split the difference and I pay $760,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 760000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll counter with $800,000. This is a fair price for the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is back to her original offer.** This indicates she might be firm on this price.
* **We're already halfway through the negotiations.**  I don't want to risk running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **The offer is still a good deal.** $800,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a good price. I've successfully negotiated a $200,000 discount from John's offer."
