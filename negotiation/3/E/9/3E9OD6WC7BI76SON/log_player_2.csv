"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. This is a great deal for both of us, as you get a good price and I can avoid selling it to someone else for a higher amount. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer isn't terrible, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  There's no point in spending more than you have to."
