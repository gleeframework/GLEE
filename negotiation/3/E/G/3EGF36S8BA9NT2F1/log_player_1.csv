{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fantastic deal and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable markup but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point as it recognizes Bob's value for the product while still allowing for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is still a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to be closer to $10,500 to make this work for me. It's a fantastic product and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
