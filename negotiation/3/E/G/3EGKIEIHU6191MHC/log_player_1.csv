"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's not unreasonable given my valuation of the product. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value and potential benefits of the product, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I acknowledge that this is a negotiation and express openness to discussion. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Round 2:** Based on Bob's response, I will adjust my offer if necessary, trying to get as close to my $1,000,000 target as possible.  
* **John as a Safety Net:**  If the negotiations with Bob stall or go too low, I can always switch to John who offers a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1200000. I'm thinking of a price around $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Target:**  While $900,000 is closer to my target than Bob's initial offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe there's still room to negotiate upwards. By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal my willingness to continue the discussion. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm not desperate to sell immediately and want to explore the possibility of getting closer to my $1,000,000 target.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Round 3:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that is slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer, aiming for a compromise. 
* **John as Backup:**  John remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail to reach a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's closer to where we need to be.  How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while also acknowledging your budget constraints. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will work for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Price Point:**  $1,050,000 is closer to my goal of $1,000,000 while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Round 4:** Based on Bob's response, I'll continue to negotiate towards my desired price, keeping John as a backup option if the negotiations fail to reach a suitable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While $950,000 is closer to my target, it's still below the $1,000,000 I can get from John. I'm not willing to settle for less unless there's a high chance of getting a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate upwards, especially since Bob seems willing to compromise.
* **John as Backup:** John is a solid option, and I'm not desperate to sell to Bob right away.

**Next Steps:**

* **Round 5:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my target, but still acknowledges Bob's willingness to compromise.  I'll aim for a price that balances my desired profit with the likelihood of a successful deal. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall or go below my target, I will switch to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue discussing this. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, demonstrating flexibility, but not sacrificing too much of my desired profit.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm framing this as a logical compromise, emphasizing the value of the product and the concessions I've already made.
* **Urgency:** I'm hinting at a potential need to finalize the deal, subtly suggesting a time limit for Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Round 6:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll assess my options. If he accepts, we close the deal. If he rejects, I'll consider another counteroffer or explore selling to John if necessary.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'll continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to switch to John if the negotiation with Bob fails to reach a suitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $925000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $925,000 is still significantly below my desired price and my $1,000,000 valuation. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are slim. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my target price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Closing the Deal:** I'll contact John and finalize the sale for $1,000,000. This is the most profitable and secure option given the current situation."
