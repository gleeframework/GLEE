Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me at this point. If not, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum.  While I could keep negotiating, the risk of losing more time with Bob and ending up with a lower price than John's offer is too high. I'm going to sell to John for $12,000."
