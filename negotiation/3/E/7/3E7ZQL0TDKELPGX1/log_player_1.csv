Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This should give me a profit of $100,000, which is a decent amount considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a decent price. Since I'm trying to maximize my profit, I'll think carefully about my next move.

After considering the options, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $850,000 and send him a counteroffer to try to get a better price. I'll aim to get closer to the product's true value to Bob, which is $1,000,000. Let's see if I can get him to meet me in the middle.

I'll send a new counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $925,000}

This is a higher price than his offer, but still lower than the product's true value to him. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject this offer."
