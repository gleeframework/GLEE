"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you highlighting the product's value.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
