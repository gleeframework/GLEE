Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is significantly below the value of this product. To be completely transparent, I have other interested buyers.  To keep our discussions going, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to understand that this product holds significant value for me, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I'm willing to accept. I'm prepared to let this deal go if we can't find common ground. My final offer is $1,500,000. This is my absolute bottom line.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her bottom line is $1,500,000. This is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay.  It's time to cut your losses and go with your safe option, John."
