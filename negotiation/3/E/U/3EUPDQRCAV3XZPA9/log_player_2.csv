Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,400,000. This is a serious offer reflecting the unique value this product holds.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're both serious about making a deal here. Let's find a compromise.  How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's be realistic â€“ $750,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000,  but that's my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the true value you'll be receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 
It's unlikely Alice will go below $975,000. Since your goal is to spend no more than $800,000, it's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
