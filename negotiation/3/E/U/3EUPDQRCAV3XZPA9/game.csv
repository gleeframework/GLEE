"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,400,000. This is a serious offer reflecting the unique value this product holds.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see that we're both serious about making a deal here. Let's find a compromise.  How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's be realistic â€“ $750,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000,  but that's my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the true value you'll be receiving.",975000.0,Alice,7,
