"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. Given its exceptional quality and features, it's valued at $150 by me. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be interested in discussing this further? If so, let's aim for a price that reflects its value to you while ensuring a fair return for me. I propose we negotiate towards a price between $120 and $140. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $135 is significantly more than your $100 limit and much closer to Alice's valuation. 
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $100, which perfectly meets your budget.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save $35."
