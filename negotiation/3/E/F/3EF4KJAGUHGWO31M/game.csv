"Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product of exceptional value. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000. This is a significant discount, considering its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $1500000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000, but that's my maximum offer. I'd like to know if you're willing to meet me in the middle or if you have any flexibility in your pricing.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, I'm not quite ready to accept $1200000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000, but this is a final compromise on my end.  Consider the potential value of this product, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to pay $1275000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
