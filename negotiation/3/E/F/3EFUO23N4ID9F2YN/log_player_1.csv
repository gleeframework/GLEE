Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives Bob a little room to negotiate, while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum price.  I'm confident that I can get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,500.  This is still a good deal for Bob, but it's closer to what I'm hoping to get. I'm optimistic that he'll accept, but I'm also willing to walk away if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still not quite there.  At this point, it's becoming clear that we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John and avoid further negotiation."
