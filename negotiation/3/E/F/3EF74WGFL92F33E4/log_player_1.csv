I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I could sell to John for $100 now, I'm hoping I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $110? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
