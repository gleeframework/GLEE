"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room to negotiate if Bob is willing to play. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I will counter with a higher price in the next round, keeping John's offer as my fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum value and hopefully a more appealing price for Bob. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can be happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm eager to sell, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round, but I'm increasingly aware of John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it's a compromise to meet Bob halfway. We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers have consistently been below my minimum value.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with an even lower price.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $1,200,000."
