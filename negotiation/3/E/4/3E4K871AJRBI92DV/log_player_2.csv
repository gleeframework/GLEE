{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. This counteroffer is a strong starting point, offering Alice a decent profit while still saving Bob a substantial amount.  It's likely Alice will counter, but this sets the tone for a negotiation that benefits Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price.  While closer, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's bottom line. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within Bob's budget. This could be a sweet spot for a deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget and is very close to his target price. While a further counteroffer might yield a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject it, forcing Bob to either pay more or buy from John. At this point, accepting the offer is the most practical choice. Bob saves a significant amount compared to buying from John, and the negotiation has been successful."
