"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $105. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. Let's meet in the middle at $102.50. It's a compromise that works for both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can meet you at $101, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. Let's meet at $101.",101.0,Alice,7,
