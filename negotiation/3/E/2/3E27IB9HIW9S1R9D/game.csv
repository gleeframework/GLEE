"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be a fantastic asset for you as well.  I'm starting with a price of $1750000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. It's essential that I get at least $1600000 for this product.  This price still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see your point, and I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $1600000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $1550000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1550000.0,Bob,4,
