Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point, and I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $1600000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $1550000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
