Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Value:** $12,000 (the least you'll accept)
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** $10,000 (what he thinks it's worth)
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** $12,000 (your safety net)

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer.  Your goal is to get Bob to pay as close to his perceived value as possible without going below your reservation value.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $11,500, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Starting High:**  $11,500 leaves room for negotiation while still being above your reservation value.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message implies flexibility, which can encourage Bob to counter-offer.
* **No Mention of John:** Revealing your guaranteed offer weakens your position.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get more than your reservation value.
* **Bob Counters:**  Negotiation begins. You can gauge his willingness to pay and adjust accordingly, never going below $12,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You accept John's offer and meet your reservation value.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Factors like your relationship with Bob, your negotiation style, and the nature of the product could influence your strategy."
