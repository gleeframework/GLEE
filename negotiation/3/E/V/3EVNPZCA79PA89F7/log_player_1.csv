"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. It's important to leave room for negotiation, but I want to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and meet at $152.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 152.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $152.50 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm still confident I can get more, and I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $140 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $145?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $142.50?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $142.50.  While it's still below what I initially hoped for, it's only a few dollars less than what I'd get from John, and it keeps the negotiation going.  It's possible that if I continue to reject Bob's offers, he might become less willing to negotiate further."
