{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,500, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Being friendly:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, hopefully leading to a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. 

I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product, and this offer provides a starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum value and sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm not desperate to sell at any price. If negotiations don't work out, I can always sell to John for my desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising, but not conceding:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $11,000, which is significantly closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Staying positive:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and optimistic, aiming to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the $11,000 offer as a solution that makes us both happy. 

I'm confident that $11,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within Bob's budget.  If he still refuses, I'll need to reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $10,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob is willing to budge slightly, his offer of $10,750 remains below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:** Bob is clearly unwilling to meet me closer to my desired price. Further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming and unproductive.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price of $12,000, guaranteeing a profit and avoiding any further haggling. 

While I appreciate Bob's interest and his willingness to negotiate, securing my desired price and minimizing the risk of further negotiation makes selling to John the most sensible option."
