"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its market value to you.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm also looking to save as much money as I can. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while offering you a significant savings compared to your estimated value. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where we can both be happy with the deal. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit below my expectations. How about we compromise at $890,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. We're so close to a deal, let's make it happen!",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $875,000. I'd like to make one final offer: $875,000 is my absolute maximum. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",875000.0,Bob,6,
