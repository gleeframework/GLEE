Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in.  My asking price is $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This way we both get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer.  I'll see if I can push a bit further with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $10,750 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet at $11,000. It's a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
