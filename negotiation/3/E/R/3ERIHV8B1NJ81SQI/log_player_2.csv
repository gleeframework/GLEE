# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I believe this product has significant potential, and I'm confident it could be worth much more than $1500000 to the right buyer.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $2000000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay $1500000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.
