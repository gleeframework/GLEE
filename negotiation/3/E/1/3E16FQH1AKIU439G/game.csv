"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $11000 and $12500. How about $11750? It's a fair middle ground that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $10500 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider another compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $11000 and $12500. How about $11250? It's a small step up from your offer, but still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, but I'm also open to further negotiation if you're willing to consider it.",10000.0,Bob,6,
