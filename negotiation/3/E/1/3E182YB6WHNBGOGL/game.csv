"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $600,000. Can we discuss further?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $600,000 is significantly less than I hoped for, I'm willing to move closer to your offer. Would you consider $850,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
