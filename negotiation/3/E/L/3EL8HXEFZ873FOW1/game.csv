"Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering what it's worth to me and your desired selling price. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
