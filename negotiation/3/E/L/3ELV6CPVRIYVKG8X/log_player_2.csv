Let's try to split the difference. $115 is still a good deal for you, and it might be appealing enough for Alice to accept."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is not willing to go lower than $140, which is still a bit more than you are comfortable paying. You have only 3 rounds left and it's unlikely you can get a better price from Alice. It's better to buy from John, since you can get the product for your target price of $150."
