Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's still significantly undervaluing the product. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap sufficiently, and John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a substantial profit."
