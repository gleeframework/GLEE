Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $12,000. It's worth a lot more to you, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get out of this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $10,000 is a good compromise and is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's better to secure a deal now rather than risk losing Bob as a buyer."
