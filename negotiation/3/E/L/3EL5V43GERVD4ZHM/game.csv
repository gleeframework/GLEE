"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for a product that's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep talking, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $101.25?  That way, we both get a fair deal.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
