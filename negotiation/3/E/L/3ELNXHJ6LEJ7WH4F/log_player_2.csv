"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price or proceed with your backup option, saving yourself a considerable amount of money."
