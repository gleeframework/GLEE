Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (your ""reservation value"").
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum.  Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**The Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the given values, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor with Negotiation Room:** Start with a price significantly higher than John's offer, hoping Bob might negotiate down, potentially exceeding $1,500,000. This has risk, as Bob might walk away immediately.

2. **Accept John's Offer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, you can skip negotiation with Bob and take the sure thing.

**The Offer (Option 1 - Risky)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment, and I'm open to discussing the details further."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** The offered price is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This aims to create an anchor point for negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling potential flexibility.

**Important Notes**

* **Option 2 (selling to John) is the safer choice** if you want to guarantee the $1,500,000. 
* **Success with Option 1 depends on Bob's willingness to negotiate** and potentially pay more than he initially intended. You'd need to present strong arguments about the product's value to justify a price above his valuation."
