{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a deal.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $100 if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $95. Let me know if this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I can still do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $98.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $93 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk going lower. John is a guaranteed sale at $100, and that's a better outcome than potentially getting $93 from Bob."
