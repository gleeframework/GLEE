"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working with a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which reflects the value I'm confident you'll find in the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I still believe that $8,000 is within a reasonable range for us to reach an agreement. Could we perhaps meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, Alice. Considering the value of your product and my budget, I would like to propose $9,200 as a fair price. I hope this suggestion will be agreeable to you.",9200.0,Bob,6,
