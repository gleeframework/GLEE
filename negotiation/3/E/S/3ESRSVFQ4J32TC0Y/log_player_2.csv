Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $85, which is $87.50. This is a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring to you. What do you think?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $83 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $83, which is $85.25. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85.25

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my price point, but I'm starting to get impatient.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure we're going to reach a deal I'm happy with. I'm going to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80."
