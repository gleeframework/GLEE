"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a good starting point. It's above your minimum ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation and still gives Bob a good deal.
* **The message** is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get the negotiation started:** A clear offer encourages Bob to engage.
* **Set a strong initial position:** Starting high gives you more room to negotiate down.
* **Focus on value:** Emphasize the product's worth to Bob to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my desired price.**  I want to earn as much as possible, and selling for $12,000 would mean leaving $1,000 on the table. 
* **There are still rounds left.** It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a better price.  
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet.** While it's a guaranteed $10,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This demonstrates willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price. 
* **Value Focus:**  I'm emphasizing that $12,500 is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value of the product to him.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I believe $12,000 remains a fair price. I would like to stick to this figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob is sticking to his offer.**  He seems firm on $12,000.
* **I'm still not happy with $12,000.**  It's significantly below my desired price, and I'm not willing to settle just yet.
* **There are still rounds left.**  I have a chance to continue negotiating and try to improve the offer. 
* **Selling to John is too risky.** While I would get $10,000, it's significantly less than what I could potentially get from Bob if I continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round, trying to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $12,000, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $12,250. It's a small increase, but it would be a good compromise and help me get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm offering a small increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  This could make him feel like I'm being more reasonable.
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes that $12,250 is a ""good compromise"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Continued Negotiation:**  I'm still open to further discussion, hoping to get closer to my desired price. 

**Reasoning:**

* I don't want to risk selling to John at a lower price. 
* I'm hopeful that by making a small but noticeable compromise, I can incentivize Bob to come up a bit in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, Alice. However, I still feel that $12,000 is the right price for me. I hope we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob is persistent.** He is still firmly set on his offer of $12,000.
* **My desired price is still higher.**  Even though time is running out, I'm not ready to settle for $12,000 yet. 
* **John is still an option.** While selling to John would be a loss compared to my desired price, it's a better option than accepting Bob's offer and settling for a lower amount. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer again in the next round, but I will also keep John as a fallback option in case negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $12,000.  I'm willing to come down to $12,100, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to consider other options.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 12100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making this a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm offering a very small reduction, showing I'm still trying to reach an agreement but making it clear I'm close to my limit.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options, which could push him to accept.
* **Direct Language:**  The message is direct and clear, leaving no room for misinterpretation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a real possibility if we can't reach a better deal with Bob.
* **Pressure Tactic:**  A final offer can sometimes push a buyer to accept, especially if they believe they might lose the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your last offer and I believe $12,000 remains a fair price for me. I hope you can accept this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to our last two rounds, and I don't think I'll be able to convince Bob to raise his offer.
* **Minimizing Losses:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, selling to John for $10,000 is the best way to avoid a complete loss and ensure I make some profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* It's unlikely I can get Bob to come up to a more favorable price in the remaining rounds. 
* Selling to John guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing if the negotiations with Bob continue to fail. 
* While I'm disappointed I couldn't reach a better agreement with Bob, it's a strategic decision to minimize potential losses and ensure a sale."
