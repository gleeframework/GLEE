"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $18,000 is still too far off from what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $13,000? That's my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm happy to see we're making progress. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
