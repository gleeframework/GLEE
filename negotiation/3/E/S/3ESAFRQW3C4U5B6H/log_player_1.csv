Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Back-up:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to aim higher with Bob.

**The Strategy:**

This offer aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit. If Bob accepts, you earn a substantial amount over your minimum. If he negotiates, you have room to lower the price slightly while still making a great deal. If he rejects the offer outright, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
