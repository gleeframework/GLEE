Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:**  A positive message encourages Bob to engage and makes him feel valued.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates I'm open to discussion and willing to find a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:** 

I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my counteroffers based on his willingness to negotiate. If he seems hesitant, I'll lower the price gradually.  If he's very interested, I might try to hold out for a higher price. If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Reasonable:**  $85 is only slightly below my minimum of $80. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try to get a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob would counteroffer again.
* **Time is Money:**  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk losing both Bob and John. 

**Strategy:** 

Although I'd prefer a higher price, $85 is still a good deal for me. I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and move on to the next sale."
