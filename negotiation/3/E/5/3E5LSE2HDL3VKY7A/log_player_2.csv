"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's still above my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is below Bob's maximum price of $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a good deal. He's offering $105, which is still above Alice's minimum price of $100, showing his willingness to negotiate.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about $110? It's still a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his desired range.  Since Bob has 7 rounds remaining, he has room to continue negotiating for a better price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive and could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $107.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. Offering $107.50 shows that he's serious about closing the deal but is still pushing for a lower price. This counteroffer is a strategic move, aiming to find a middle ground and potentially bring the negotiation closer to a successful conclusion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $109. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily pushing for a lower price and has now reached a point where Alice's offer is very close to his desired range. While he could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal increases with each round.  Accepting the offer at $109 secures the product at a price significantly lower than his maximum of $120 and allows Bob to save $11.  This decision balances the desire for a lower price with the need to close the deal within the allotted rounds."
