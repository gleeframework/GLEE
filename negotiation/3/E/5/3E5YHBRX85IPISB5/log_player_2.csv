Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better price. I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm not quite ready to commit at that price.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not ready to sell at $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value to both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price than her initial offer and still leaves room for me to save compared to buying from John.  I'm willing to accept this offer."
