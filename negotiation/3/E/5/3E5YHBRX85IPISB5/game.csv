"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm not quite ready to commit at that price.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not ready to sell at $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value to both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
