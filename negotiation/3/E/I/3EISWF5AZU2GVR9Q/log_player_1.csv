Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll reap."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to our minimum.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth, even if Bob doesn't perceive it at our level.
* **""Fair deal"" framing:**  This positions the offer as mutually beneficial rather than solely focused on our gain.
* **Alternative in mind:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, giving us leverage. We don't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being realistic. If Bob rejects the offer, we haven't lost anything and can move on to John."
