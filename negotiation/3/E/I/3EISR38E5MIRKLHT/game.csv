"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $150? This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find this product for this price anywhere else.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $150, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $130? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really think that's the most I can afford.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $140. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this fantastic product.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $125 is still too low for me.  I'm going to stick to my last offer of $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find this product for this price anywhere else. Let's close the deal!",140.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to stick to your last offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $100, so how about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,8,
