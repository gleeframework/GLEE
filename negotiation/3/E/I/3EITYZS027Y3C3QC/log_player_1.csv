Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'm selling that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than $100.
* **It's not too high:** It allows for some room for negotiation without scaring Bob off.
* **It's friendly:** It starts the conversation on a positive note.

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to adjust your price and strategy based on Bob's response."
