Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, bringing the final price closer to your ideal $15,000.
* **Maintain Attractiveness:** The price is still significantly lower than your minimum ($15,000), but high enough to potentially entice Bob while maximizing your potential profit.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal without losing Bob as a potential buyer."
