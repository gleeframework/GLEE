Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. Since the product is worth the same to both of us, there is no reason to start with a lower price. This allows for room to negotiate if Bob is interested in a lower price. It also keeps the option open to sell to John for the same amount if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $850,000.  It's below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm prepared to sell the product for $950,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your offer and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $850,000 is a reasonable price based on the value of the product. I would like to propose $900,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this suggestion will be more acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale to John or having to continue negotiations further."
