I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, giving me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but if he isn't, I'm prepared to counter-offer or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, it's not a great deal for me. I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit for me, and I'm worried that if I continue to negotiate, I might risk losing the sale entirely. $11,000 is better than the $10,000 I would get from John."
