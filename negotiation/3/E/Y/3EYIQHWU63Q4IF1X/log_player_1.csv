"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it holds immense value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This price reflects the unique qualities and potential of this product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer ($1,800,000) as I don't know Bob's valuation. This allows me to maximize potential profit while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message highlights the product's uniqueness and potential to emphasize its worth.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not outrageously high, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value:** While $1,400,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I won't settle for less than that, especially since I have other options.
* **Opportunity to counter:** I want to see if I can nudge Bob closer to my desired price by counter-offering.  I have 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I have John's offer as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While it's not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to drop the price slightly to $1,500,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,800,000 to $1,500,000. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Maintaining Value:** My counteroffer remains above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out financially.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  My message emphasizes fairness, appealing to Bob's sense of equity and encouraging him to consider the value he'd receive."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I won't sell the product at a loss. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  We have 6 rounds left, and it's possible I can still reach a more agreeable price with Bob.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  While I'm open to further negotiation with Bob, I have John's offer as a safety net. If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still committed to getting a fair price for this valuable product.  I'm willing to consider $1,350,000 as a final compromise. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it's the closest I can go while still ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer.  This creates urgency and encourages Bob to consider accepting.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering $1,350,000, which is halfway between Bob's last offer of $1,300,000 and my previous offer of $1,500,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting Investment:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and emphasizing that I need to recoup my investment. This adds emotional weight to my offer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I won't sell at a loss, even though I'm close.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, there's a high risk that we won't reach an agreement. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum value and allows me to avoid further negotiation. 

While I would like to get a higher price, securing a sale with John is a safer and more efficient option at this point."
