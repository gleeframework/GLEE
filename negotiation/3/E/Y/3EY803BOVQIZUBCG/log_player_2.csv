"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting high, hoping you'll accept. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to get a lower price closer to her $8,000 value."
