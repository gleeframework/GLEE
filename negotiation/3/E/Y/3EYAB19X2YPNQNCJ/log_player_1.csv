Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,200,000 (your value from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to benefit ($100,000 gain) while securing you a significant profit above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between attracting Bob's purchase and maximizing your potential earnings."
