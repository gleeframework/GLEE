"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I'm eager to find a price we can both agree on, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
