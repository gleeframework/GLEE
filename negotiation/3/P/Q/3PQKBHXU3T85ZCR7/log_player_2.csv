"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price point, so it's worth trying to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $10,500 is a bold move, but it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial offer. While Bob is getting closer to his goal, it's still not ideal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a compromise, acknowledging that Alice might not go as low as $10,500.  This move keeps the negotiation going and hopefully leads to a final price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price. It's also worth noting that Bob still has 5 rounds left to close the deal, giving him ample time to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer slightly, showing his willingness to meet Alice halfway. He is getting closer to Alice's price point, but still below his target. This move keeps the negotiation going and hopefully leads to a final price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  Bob has 3 rounds left, which is enough time to potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing he's willing to compromise. $12,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing he's getting closer to Alice's price point. He has only two rounds left, so this might be his final attempt to get a good deal before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to John's price. With only one round left, it's unlikely Bob can get a better deal from Alice.  Given the time constraint and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000. This guarantees him the product while staying within his budget."
