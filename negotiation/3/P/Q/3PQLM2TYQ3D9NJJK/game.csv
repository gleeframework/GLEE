"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? That gives you a good price, and brings me closer to my target. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $925,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your time and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $925,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm flexible.  Let's meet at $940,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $940,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. What do you think?",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $920,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $935,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise on my part. Let's close this deal.",935000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you say?",915000.0,Bob,8,
