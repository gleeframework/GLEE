Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $110. I believe you'll find it to be a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $120, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80) and John's offer ($80).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Strong Opening:**  Offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value increases the chance he'll accept outright, avoiding the need to go to John. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower, giving yourself more wiggle room.
* **Market Context:** If similar products are readily available at lower prices, you might need to adjust your offer downwards. However, the information provided suggests this is a unique item or opportunity."
