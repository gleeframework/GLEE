"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $90 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $100, but Alice is asking for $90. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's room for a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** This keeps pressure on Alice to make a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussion, I'd like to counter with an offer of $87 for the product. This allows us both to reach a fair agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering it for $87.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more.** A couple of dollars might be saved, but the risk of Alice walking away or you needing to buy from John for $100 isn't worth it. 
* **It's a fair deal.** You're getting a good price, and Alice is likely making a decent profit."
