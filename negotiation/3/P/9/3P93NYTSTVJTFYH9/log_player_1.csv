I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,700,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant increase from my minimum acceptable price and leaves me with a good profit. Accepting this offer is the most sensible option."
