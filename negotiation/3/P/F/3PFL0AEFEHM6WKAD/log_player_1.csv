Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is higher than $8,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $10,000 is still above your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for back-and-forth to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.  If he rejects, I can then adjust the price downwards, but always keeping in mind my minimum value of $12,000.  I also have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I know the product is worth. I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,200 is a bit closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite there. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my full asking price. It's better to be safe than sorry and secure the deal with John."
