"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it would be of great value to you, even more so than this asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While her product might be valuable, you have a guaranteed option to buy it from John for $8,000. Accepting Alice's offer would mean overpaying by $1,500."
