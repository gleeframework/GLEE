"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's initial offer is too high. It's closer to my maximum budget than her minimum selling price. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I was hoping to spend closer to $90.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it leaves me with a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  She's still closer to her starting price than mine. I'll reject and propose a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and say $97.50? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 97.50
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $102.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I'm not losing money on the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but I still think there's room for negotiation. I'll push for a slightly lower price one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer to a price I can agree on. How about we meet in the middle at $100 even? That seems like a fair and clean deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
