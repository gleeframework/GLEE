Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than $80, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still more than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's friendly:**  The message is casual and friendly, encouraging Bob to engage. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's tempting to take the $60, it's better to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I can counteroffer with something closer to my desired price, or if the negotiation becomes too difficult, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That's still a great deal for you, and I can make it work on my end."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
