{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. It's also a reasonable starting point considering the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than $10,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves a profit margin for me.  This counteroffer should demonstrate my willingness to find a middle ground while still trying to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $11,500 is a better deal than selling to John, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I think I can push for a little more and see if Bob is willing to budge.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a reasonable compromise, coming closer to Bob's offer while still keeping some profit margin.  I think this offer shows that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd prefer to make more money, I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob is going nowhere.  It's clear he's not willing to meet me at a price that's fair, so it's better to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale."
