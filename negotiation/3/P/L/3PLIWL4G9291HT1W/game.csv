"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I need a price that aligns with my budget constraints. Could we settle at $700,000? This offer represents a significant investment on my part while acknowledging the product's worth.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large. To be frank, anything below $900,000 would be difficult for me to justify. I'm open to hearing your thoughts, but I believe that price accurately reflects the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $900,000 is a bit too high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe this demonstrates my seriousness about the purchase while respecting your bottom line.",750000.0,Bob,6,
