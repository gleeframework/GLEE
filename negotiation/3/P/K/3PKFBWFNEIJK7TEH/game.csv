"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. If we can't agree on that, I might have to look at other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking to pay a bit less, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer below $1,050,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is a significant step in the right direction. However,  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can offer the product to you for $1,012,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,012,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  I'm willing to go up to $993,750. Let's split the difference and close this deal.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",993750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $993,750. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I can offer the product to you for $1,007,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1007500.0,Alice,9,
