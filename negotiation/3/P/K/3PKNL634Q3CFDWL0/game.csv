"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $110. Could you consider that?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate. I can do $115, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident you'll find the product valuable, and I think $115 is a fair price.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of a price around $108. Could you consider that?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the negotiation. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. I can do $112, but I think that's as low as I can go without losing money. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway as well. I can do $110.50. Would you be willing to accept that?",110.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $112.50, but that's as high as I can go. Let's meet in the middle again, and I'll throw in a small discount for you.",112.5,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I can do $111.25. Would you be willing to accept that?",111.25,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I can do $113, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",113.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I can do $112. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",112.0,Bob,10,
