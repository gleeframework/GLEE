Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still keeping you well above his perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding ""limited time"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision. 

Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're guaranteed to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring you don't lose out."
