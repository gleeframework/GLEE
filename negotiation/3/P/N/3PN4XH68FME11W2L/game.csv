"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $6,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $7,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your budget. Let's close the deal!",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $7,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $7,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.",7000.0,Bob,6,
