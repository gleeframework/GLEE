Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:** Simply stating a high price isn't enough. Alice needs to justify it by highlighting the ""value"" the product offers. This makes the price seem more palatable. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The message ends with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to engage in a dialogue rather than just giving a flat ""yes"" or ""no.""

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, she might want to start with a slightly lower offer. However, starting high is generally a good strategy.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This initial offer is just the beginning. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters her initial price."
