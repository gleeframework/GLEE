"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is asking for $115. I can do better. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $110 is still a good deal for me, as it's below my maximum value of $120. I'll accept her offer."
