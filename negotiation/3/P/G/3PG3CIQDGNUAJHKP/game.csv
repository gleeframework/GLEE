"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a good price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This would give you a great product at a fair price, and it would also allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
