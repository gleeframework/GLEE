"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $850000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. While $850000 is a good starting point, I believe the value of this product justifies a slightly higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $925000?  This would still be a significant saving for you, and it allows me to be fair to myself.  Let's see if we can make this work.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Let's aim for a price closer to $875000. I believe this strikes a balance between fairness for both parties.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875000 just doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $890000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product for your business. Let's make this deal happen!",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, Alice. Let's try $880000. I believe this offers a fair compromise and keeps us within my budget.",880000.0,Bob,6,
