"Bob, I believe this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can generate great returns.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $950000. This reflects a fair value for both of us.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This price is fair given my valuation and allows for a decent profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $900000.  This ensures both of us can benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000. This reflects a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
