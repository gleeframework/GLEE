Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and well above my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our values, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,500 is still too low for me, and I think I can get a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would be a fair compromise, and it still leaves you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above your minimum value. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get a bit more, $10,200 is a good price, and Bob has indicated this is his final offer.  There's a risk in rejecting and continuing to negotiate, especially given the limited rounds. Accepting ensures a solid profit and avoids the potential of ending up with John's lower offer."
