"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $98. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
