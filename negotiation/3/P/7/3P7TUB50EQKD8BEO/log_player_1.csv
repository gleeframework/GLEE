Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, my final offer. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing interest, his final offer of $14,500 is still below John's standing offer of $15,000.  There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and further negotiation might not be fruitful. It's time to cut losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
