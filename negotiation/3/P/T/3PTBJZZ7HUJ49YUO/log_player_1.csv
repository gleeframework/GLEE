Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, giving him the impression that I'm flexible.

This strategy allows me to potentially secure a good price, while also keeping the negotiation open and avoiding a premature deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $90 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, I show Bob I'm not desperate to sell and maintain my negotiating power.

While $120 is the ideal outcome, I don't want to rush into a deal with John when there's still a chance to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your budget, but I can't go that low. How about $95?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I frame the price as ""fair for both of us"", appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While closer to Bob's price, $95 is still above my minimum, allowing for potential further negotiation. 

This approach aims to keep the conversation moving forward while staying close to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $92 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely I'll get significantly more than $92.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only the $120 offer from John.

Given the circumstances, accepting $92 is the most rational choice. It's a good deal, and it minimizes the risk of getting nothing at all."
