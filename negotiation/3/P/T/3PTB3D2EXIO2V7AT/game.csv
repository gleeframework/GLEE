"Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but I believe I can only afford to pay up to $12,000 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $20,000 is still too high. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment for you at this price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer of $16,000. While it's closer to what I can afford, I still believe I can secure the product from another source for less. I would like to propose a price of $14,000 for the product. Let me know if this is feasible for you.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm ready to close this deal. How about we settle at $15,000? That's my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've carefully considered your last offer of $15,000, but I believe I can secure the product from another source for $14,000. I would like to make a final counteroffer of $14,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable.",14000.0,Bob,6,
