,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That gives you a significant discount from what you're willing to pay and still allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
