"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me is significantly higher.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,250. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
