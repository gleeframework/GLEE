Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's valuable to you, so I'm proposing a price of $110. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 gives Bob the feeling of potentially getting a deal and leaves you room to negotiate down slightly if needed.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going for the full $120 might make Bob feel like he's not getting any benefit and could lead to him rejecting the offer.

This strategy balances getting a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
