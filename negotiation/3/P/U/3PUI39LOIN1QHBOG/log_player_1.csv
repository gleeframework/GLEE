{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $200.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $150. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $180? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $180 is above your minimum, it's still a good offer. However, you're aiming for a higher price and have room to negotiate.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget. Let's split the difference. How about $190?  That's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 190} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to pay up to $180 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $185? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $185. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $185
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While you'd prefer to get closer to your initial asking price, Bob's offer of $185 is reasonable and above your minimum.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit."
