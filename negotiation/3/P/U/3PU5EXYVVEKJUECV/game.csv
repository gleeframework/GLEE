"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a great price. I'm offering it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price elsewhere.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product, and that's as high as I can go.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is your limit, but I still think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product, and that's my final offer.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $122. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",122.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a sale, but I'm really not willing to go above $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $122, so I'll offer $118.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",118.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to accept $118.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $119.50. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",119.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really not willing to go any higher than $118.50. I'm afraid I'll have to walk away from the deal if you're not willing to meet me at this price. I'm not interested in buying from John for $80, so I'll just have to pass on the deal.",118.5,Bob,10,
