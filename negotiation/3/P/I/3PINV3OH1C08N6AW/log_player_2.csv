{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer. While it's within his budget, it's still too high, and there's room for negotiation. Bob has 10 rounds, giving him ample opportunity to try to secure a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,200,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously, but still leaves room for further concessions if needed."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal target. There are still rounds available, and continuing to negotiate could potentially yield a better price.  Bob should reject the offer and try to secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not quite low enough for Bob to feel comfortable accepting.  With more rounds remaining, Bob should continue to push for a better price. There's still room for negotiation, and he might be able to get closer to his target price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

Bob is now making a more aggressive counteroffer, aiming to meet Alice halfway. He has already shown his willingness to compromise, and this counteroffer demonstrates that he is serious about closing the deal while still trying to achieve a price below $1,350,000. This could be a good compromise for both parties."
