"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward with the sale.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you think about it?",920000.0,Bob,4,
