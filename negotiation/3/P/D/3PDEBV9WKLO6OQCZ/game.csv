"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,850,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement closer to that number.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I understand you're willing to stretch your budget, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise reflecting the product's true value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
