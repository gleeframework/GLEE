"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a better deal than $120, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that's a bit higher than my budget. How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower price point that is still within his budget and feels reasonable, given Alice's value of $120. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness about buying the product while also setting a clear price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum limit of $80.  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and by rejecting Alice's offer, he can push for a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a bit high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $88? "", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price closer to his ideal price point of $80. He's trying to find a middle ground with Alice, hoping that she'll accept this counteroffer. Bob is showing persistence while being respectful in his message."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do 90, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is the closest Alice has come to Bob's budget, it's still above his $80 limit. Bob is determined to save as much money as possible, so he'll continue to negotiate. He knows that if the deal falls through, he can still get the product from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $90 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $87.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm on his commitment to staying under $80 while still showing a willingness to compromise.  By offering $87, he is giving Alice a chance to close the deal without having to go all the way down to his $80 limit. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm really close to your price, Bob! I can do 89, but that's my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $89 is very close to Bob's budget, he has been actively negotiating to get a better price and has reached a point where he's comfortable buying from John. This decision is a calculated move, weighing the possibility of further negotiation with Alice against the certainty of acquiring the product for $80 from John.  Bob is likely to feel that the time and effort spent on further negotiation with Alice are not worth the potential savings of just a few dollars."
