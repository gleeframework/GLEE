"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product is worth a lot to the right buyer. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm on a tight budget. $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could you do $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here.  While I want to find a fair deal, I also know the true value of this product. I can go as low as $14,500, but that's my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
