Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is significantly higher than your minimum:** $11,500 is well above your $10,000 minimum, giving you a good profit margin.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $11,500 is less than Bob's maximum value, leaving space for him to counter and for you to potentially negotiate a higher price. 

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of getting a good price while also being open to negotiation."
