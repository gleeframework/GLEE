"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I need to see if I can get a better deal from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable margin. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal profit. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can close the deal with Bob before I settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm making a final compromise to see if Bob will meet me halfway. This offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair deal and finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  With only a few rounds remaining, it's not worth risking losing a sure $12,000 from John. It's time to take the guaranteed profit."
