Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but we're not quite there yet. We're willing to meet you at $775,000 again, but this time, we're willing to throw in some additional support and training to help you get the most out of the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While still above my ideal price, Alice offering additional support and training adds value to the deal. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and this offer prevents the risk of the negotiation failing and having to buy from John at the much higher price."
