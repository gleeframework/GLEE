"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be very valuable to you. Let's start with a price of $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $80. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the price at $120? I believe this reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my $100 limit. Would you be willing to come down to $95? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
