"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be very valuable to you. Let's start with a price of $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's wise to reject and start negotiating. There are 9 rounds left, and you have a good chance of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $80. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive start:** My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** I acknowledge the value of the product while stating my budget constraints. This builds trust and encourages further discussion.
* **Clear offer:**  I explicitly state the price I'm willing to pay, leaving no room for ambiguity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the price at $120? I believe this reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I have 7 rounds left, and there's room to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my $100 limit. Would you be willing to come down to $95? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show continued negotiation:**  I reiterate my budget constraints and propose a new price that's closer to my limit.
* **Compromise:** Offering $95 indicates a willingness to meet halfway, making it seem like a fair offer.
* **Finality:**  I suggest a ""final deal"" to incentivize Alice to accept."
