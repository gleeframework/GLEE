"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $97.50 for the product. This is closer to my budget while still recognizing its value.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to settle on $98 for the product?",98.0,Bob,6,
