Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $105. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about $98? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $97? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $97.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation, as it's very possible to end up with a worse deal than buying from John for $100."
