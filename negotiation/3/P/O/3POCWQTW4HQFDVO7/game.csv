"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $105. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $90?  That's a fair deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about $98? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price.",98.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $94?",94.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $97? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price.",97.0,Alice,7,
