Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low.  This product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you can see its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go one step further and meet you at $13,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $13,000, and we have a guaranteed option at $10,000 with John.  Prolonging the negotiation further is unlikely to yield a better outcome than buying from John."
