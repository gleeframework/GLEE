"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low.  This product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you can see its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $14,000 is still pushing my budget.  Would you be willing to settle at $12,000? That's a significant price increase from my initial offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 is still below my minimum. However, I'm willing to compromise to close this deal. How about we settle at $13,000? This gives you a good price while ensuring I get a fair return on my product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and agree on $12,500? It's a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go one step further and meet you at $13,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen.",13500.0,Alice,7,
