"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $125 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $95? I feel that's a fair offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price.  To be honest, $100 is the absolute highest I can go. I think thatâ€™s a very fair price considering the market, and I'm ready to make the deal right now if you're happy with that.",100.0,Bob,6,
