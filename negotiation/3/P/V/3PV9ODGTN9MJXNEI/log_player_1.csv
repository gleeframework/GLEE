{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob ($100). I am aiming for a high starting price to give myself room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150) while still being reasonable for Bob. I believe $125 is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $125 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $95? I feel that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd like to make a sale,  Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm still aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $150 as possible. $110 feels like a reasonable compromise that's not too far off from Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price.  To be honest, $100 is the absolute highest I can go. I think thatâ€™s a very fair price considering the market, and I'm ready to make the deal right now if you're happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
