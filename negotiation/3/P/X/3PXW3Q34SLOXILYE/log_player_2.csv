"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as the price from John, there's no benefit to rejecting. Accepting Alice's offer means buying the product at the same price, but you're not sure of Alice's valuation so there's a chance she's selling at a loss, which is good for you."
