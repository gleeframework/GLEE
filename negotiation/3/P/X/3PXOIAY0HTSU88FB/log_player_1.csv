Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $13,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. I can sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000, which is a better outcome than potentially settling for less with Bob."
