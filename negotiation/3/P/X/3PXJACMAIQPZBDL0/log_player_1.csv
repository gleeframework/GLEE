"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be of great benefit to your operations. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above what I'm willing to pay. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go above $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I want to try and squeeze out a better deal from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show you my commitment to making this deal work. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge beyond $850,000.  At this point, I've already lowered my price significantly and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John, so I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000."
