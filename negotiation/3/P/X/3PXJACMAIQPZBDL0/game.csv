"Alice, your offer is way above what I'm willing to pay. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go above $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show you my commitment to making this deal work. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
