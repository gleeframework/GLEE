"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room:** By starting high, I can gradually decrease the price in subsequent rounds if Bob rejects the initial offer. 
* **Appear Confident:** A strong opening offer can signal that I believe in the product's value. 

It's unlikely Bob will accept this initial offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. There's a chance I can get a slightly better deal, especially since we're only in round 2. I'll try to nudge him up a bit before settling for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not giving up all my negotiating power.  A $20 decrease shows flexibility.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal how much Bob is truly willing to pay. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects it, I'll know I need to move closer to his $120 offer. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I still emphasize the product's value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we are past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  

* **Good Deal:**  $130 is a solid profit above my minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a mere $10 more risks Bob walking away or my having to settle for John's offer later.  
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now saves time and potential hassle in finding another buyer."
