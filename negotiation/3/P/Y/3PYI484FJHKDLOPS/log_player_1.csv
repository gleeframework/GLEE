"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, we aim to set a high anchor. This can influence his perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the high price (""immense value,"" ""one-of-a-kind"") adds weight to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and open to negotiation, inviting Bob to engage in the process. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room for negotiation over the next 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly lower than our initial ask. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Continue Negotiation:** We are only in Round 2, giving us ample opportunity to negotiate a better price. 
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** By rejecting, we can assess how committed Bob is to purchasing the product and how flexible he's willing to be.

We are still in a strong position as we have the backup option of selling to John for our minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, $1,800,000 represents a more accurate reflection of the product's unique qualities and market potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,650,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** We are moving closer to Bob's offer, signaling flexibility. However, we're still aiming high ($1,650,000) and justifying the price by emphasizing the product's unique value.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The language (""middle ground,"" ""mutually beneficial"") emphasizes our desire to find a compromise. 
* **Maintaining Strong Position:** We are not drastically reducing our price, showing Bob we believe in the product's high value. 

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while aiming for a price closer to our initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Based on my assessment, I would like to counter with a price of $1,600,000. I hope this suggestion will help us move closer to a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a strong deal, even if it's slightly below our initial target. Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Significant Profit:**  We are still securing a profit of $600,000, which is a substantial return.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently moved closer to our asking price, indicating his seriousness about the purchase.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further might not yield significantly better results and could risk losing Bob altogether. 

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of jeopardizing the deal outweighs the potential for a marginal gain. Accepting at $1,600,000 secures a very favorable outcome."
