Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great value for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $17,000, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to consider my offer. It also highlights the product's value.

**Strategy:**

* I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a higher price.
* By offering a price above Bob's value, I'm creating a scenario where he has incentive to negotiate. 
* I'm also providing a clear and concise offer to avoid confusion. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter and adjust my price based on his response and my desire to reach a deal quickly. 
*  Ultimately, if the negotiations drag on or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* While I could accept his offer, I'd be leaving money on the table. 
* I want to try and get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer of $14,000 and my minimum value of $15,000. This will give Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but I can't go as low as $14,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $15,500, which is halfway between my minimum price ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($14,000). 
* **Message:**  I'm being polite and acknowledging Bob's counteroffer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the benefits of this price point for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer provides a reasonable compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* By offering a middle ground, I'm hoping to quickly reach an agreement without the need for further rounds of back and forth.
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to consider if selling to John for $15,000 is a better option."
