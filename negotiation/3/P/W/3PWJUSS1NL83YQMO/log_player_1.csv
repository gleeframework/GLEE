This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential deal while also ensuring I can potentially make more than I would with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my target price and what I can get from John. I will counteroffer to try to bridge the gap."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $862500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $862,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  The difference between my target price and what I can get from John is small enough to justify another round of negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll make the deal

Bob's final offer is still significantly less than my minimum price and closer to what I would get from John.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a sale with John."
