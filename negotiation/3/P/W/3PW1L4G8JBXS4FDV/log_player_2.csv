"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a great deal for Bob, but there's still room to negotiate. It's worth exploring whether Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your asking price and my budget.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my initial asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still aim for a lower price.  While $850,000 is a good deal, there's potential to negotiate further and save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer you $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your previous asking price. I'm hopeful we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my previous asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more.  At $825,000, Bob is getting a good deal, and it's better than buying from John for $1,200,000.  There's always a risk of the negotiations breaking down, and at this point, it's better to secure the product at a reasonable price."
