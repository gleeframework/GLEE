Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions.  Let's see if we can make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still below it. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 unless I have to. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a solution.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum, I still need to secure a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's try $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
