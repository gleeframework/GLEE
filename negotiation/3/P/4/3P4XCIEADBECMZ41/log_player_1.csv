"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's a little higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept it and make a quick sale, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to him. I'm also trying to be reasonable and compromise by splitting the difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $78?  That's a pretty good offer considering you're saving me a good amount from John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $78 is still a good deal and above my minimum.  Accepting it now avoids further negotiation and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
