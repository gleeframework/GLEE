Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to consider, while also leaving me some wiggle room if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.  I hope this will encourage Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $900,000 is still significantly closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offers.  It also seems like Bob is becoming more flexible, so I'm willing to take this deal and close the sale."
