"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $980,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",980000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $980,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $960,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,
