Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and framing the offer as a win-win situation. I'm also leaving room for Bob to counter-offer, which is expected.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum price of $1,200,000 as possible. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I'm setting the tone for a potentially profitable negotiation. I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I believe I can push for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range. I'll aim for a compromise, keeping in mind Bob's budget constraints and my own minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $980,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with $980,000. This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while expressing that it's not quite in my desired range. I'm also focusing on the value of the product to emphasize why this price is fair.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and gradually decreasing my price, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate for a sale. This approach keeps the pressure on him to meet me closer to my minimum price.  I'm also using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $980,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $960,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob is offering $960,000, which is closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000 than any of the previous offers. 
* **My minimum price:** While I would ideally get closer to $1,200,000,  $960,000 is still a significant profit for me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing him as a buyer altogether and having to settle with John's offer of $1,200,000.  

**Decision:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the potential risks of further negotiation.  $960,000 is a substantial profit, and I'm willing to take it rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
