Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price. However, it's still below the perceived value of the product to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value and what I believe the product is worth. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I am confident that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it well above Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate, but also emphasizes the value I place on the product. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in making a compromise and meeting me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm not comfortable selling at this price, as it would represent a significant loss for me.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but only slightly. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining my stance on the product's value. I believe this price is reasonable and gives Bob a good deal while still being fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I value the product at $1,500,000, and I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss. I believe John is a more reasonable buyer who is willing to pay a fair price."
