You should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high, and you can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

While $11,000 is closer to your maximum budget, it's still higher than you'd like to pay. There's a good chance you can get Alice to lower the price further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You offer Alice $10,000 for the product. This is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
