"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?"",

}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but it's still too high. We should continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our last counter-offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $7,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,000.  This would give you a great deal and still allow me to make a profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has met our ideal price. We should accept this offer as it's the best we can realistically hope for in this negotiation."
