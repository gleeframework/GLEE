"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,000. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down just a little more. How about we settle on $11,500? It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
