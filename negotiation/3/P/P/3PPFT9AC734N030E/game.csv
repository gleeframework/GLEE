"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $100? It's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
