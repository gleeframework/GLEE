"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I have to consider my own interests as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counter with an offer of $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $950000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counter with an offer of $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
