Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. It also leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a higher price than my initial offer. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the possibility of a sale. If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, ensuring I don't lose money."
