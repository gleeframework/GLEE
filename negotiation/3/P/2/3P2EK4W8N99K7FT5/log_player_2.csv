"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. I can do $13,500, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise and falls within Bob's budget of $15,000.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'd be left with the more expensive option of buying from John. Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product at a reasonable price."
