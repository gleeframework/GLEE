"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Based on my research, I believe the product is worth significantly less than $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is genuinely higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
