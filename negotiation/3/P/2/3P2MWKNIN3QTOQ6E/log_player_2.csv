"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $12,000 is quite a bit more than my ideal budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the product's value. However,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than my actual budget ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and hopefully reach a price closer to my target.
* **Polite and Respectful:** Maintaining a positive tone is important in negotiations. I've acknowledged Alice's perspective while also clearly stating my own budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my budget, which is a good sign. However, $9,000 is still above what John is offering. I'll try to negotiate a bit more before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Alice. $9,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my current budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a price that splits the difference between her current offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($6,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while moving closer to a deal.
* **Below Budget, Above John:** This offer keeps me below my maximum budget while still offering Alice a significantly better price than she could get from John. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By now, both sides should be getting a sense that we need to find a compromise soon if we want to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $8,500, which is above my maximum budget and what John is offering.  While it's possible Alice might come down slightly in further negotiation, it's not worth the risk of losing the guaranteed deal with John."
