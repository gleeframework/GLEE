"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the product's value. However,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
