"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at no less than $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm confident this product would be worth a similar amount to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
