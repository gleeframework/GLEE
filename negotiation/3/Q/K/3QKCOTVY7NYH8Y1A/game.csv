"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a very generous offer, so I hope we can make a deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",10000.0,Bob,4,
