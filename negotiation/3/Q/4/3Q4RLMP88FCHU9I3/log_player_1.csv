"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting high, at $170.  This is above Bob's value, but leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. I'm confident I can get at least $150, so I'm willing to take some risk to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is still below what I'd ideally like, but it's a compromise that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price, and we can close the deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $145 is tempting, I'm still holding out for more. I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price with another round of negotiation.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue the conversation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $150.  At this point, I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll happily sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $142 is still below my minimum price, and we've reached a point where it's unlikely he'll budge.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $150.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking another round of negotiation and potentially getting less."
