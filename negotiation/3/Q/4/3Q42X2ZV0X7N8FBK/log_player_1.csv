{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, focusing on the value he'll gain. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum price of $15,000, allowing for potential counteroffers and a chance to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as leverage:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 provides a safety net and gives me confidence to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Leveraging John:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and push for a more favorable deal. 

**Next move:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:** I'm decreasing my price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** $11,000 is still above Bob's offer, suggesting there's room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still holding the option of selling to John for $15,000, providing me with leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal then. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a final counteroffer, potentially pushing him closer to my desired price or forcing him to walk away.
* **Leveraging John:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a higher price. 

**Next move:** I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price as close to $15,000 as possible."
