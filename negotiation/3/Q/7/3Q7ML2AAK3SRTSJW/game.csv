"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",7000.0,Bob,4,
