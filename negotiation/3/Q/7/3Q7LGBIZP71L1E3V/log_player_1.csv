Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.  We need to offer a price that's attractive to him but also maximizes our potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still keeping us well above our minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Backup Offer:**  We have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000) if Bob rejects our initial proposal. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  We might adjust our strategy based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he might make."
