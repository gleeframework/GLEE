Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $13,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $13,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However,  $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle at $7,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would be a substantial loss, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
