"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $13,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However,  $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle at $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,
