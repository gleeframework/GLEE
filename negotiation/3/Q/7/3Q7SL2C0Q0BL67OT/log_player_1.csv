Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price. This is a high price, but Bob has already shown interest, and it's the best starting point for a negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't feel the price is acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but still too low. I'll make a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering a price in the middle of what Bob offered and my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower price and it's getting close to my minimum.  $920,000 is a good deal considering I could sell to John for $1,000,000."
