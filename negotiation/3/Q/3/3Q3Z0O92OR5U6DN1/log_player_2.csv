Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You want to save as much money as possible, and $140 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I can come down to $135, but that's the lowest I can go.  Let's see if we can make this work.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a little high for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $130?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to go down to $132. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this now.  What do you say?
