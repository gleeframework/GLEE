"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I can come down to $135, but that's the lowest I can go.  Let's see if we can make this work. ",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a little high for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $130?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to go down to $132. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this now.  What do you say?",132.0,Alice,5,
