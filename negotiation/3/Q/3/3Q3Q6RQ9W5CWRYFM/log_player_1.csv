Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200.  Let me know if you're interested."",
 ""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $200 allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while staying well above your minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give valuable insight into his level of interest and potential for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $150 matches the price John is willing to pay. While we could try to negotiate with Bob further, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price ($150) without the risk of further negotiation."
