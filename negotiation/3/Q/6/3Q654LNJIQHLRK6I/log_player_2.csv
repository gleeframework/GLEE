"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at an excellent price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a good deal, it's still above your target of $150.  You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $120. Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm really interested in the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your interest in the product, Bob. However, I need to maintain a minimum price to ensure profitability. I am unable to accept $120. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point.  $130 is still a good deal for you, and it's better than the $150 you'd pay John. Accepting the offer allows you to get the product for a lower price than your initial goal, saving you $20."
