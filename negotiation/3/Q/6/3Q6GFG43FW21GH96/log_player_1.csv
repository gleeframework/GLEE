"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and emphasize the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $7,750? That's the highest I can go for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a bit more in the next round. I'm willing to be flexible, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still open to selling you the product, but $7,750 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs. Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to cover your costs, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get a little more, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so it's the best option at this point.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price than John's offer."
