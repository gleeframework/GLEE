"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12,750? It's a fair compromise that's closer to our desired price points. Let me know what you think.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the compromise we've reached so far.",11800.0,Bob,4,
