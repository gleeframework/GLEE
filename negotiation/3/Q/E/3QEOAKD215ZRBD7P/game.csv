"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm really hoping to get this closer to $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us considering your value and my budget.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
