"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no need to buy from John yet, as Bob still has time to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal closer to that figure."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's target price. Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price. There's no need to buy from John yet, as Bob is making progress and has more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I still believe it's worth more than $1,050,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to reduce the price by another $25,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,075,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still a bit too high. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob doesn't need to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,075,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,060,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the significant investment I'm making."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,070,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is just $10,000 above Bob's last counteroffer and is within Bob's budget. It's unlikely Bob will be able to get a much lower price in the remaining rounds, and there's a risk that Alice will walk away.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a price that is within his financial comfort zone."
