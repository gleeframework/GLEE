"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to save a little more.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is still significantly less than what Bob would pay John ($12,000).
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice might get stubborn or decide to sell to someone else. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has already compromised from her initial offer of $9,000. Accepting shows Bob is willing to be reasonable. 

This decision balances the desire to save money with the need to secure the product at a reasonable price before potentially losing the opportunity."
