"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
