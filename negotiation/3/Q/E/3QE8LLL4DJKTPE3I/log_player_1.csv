"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100} 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to get a good profit.  I'm also confident Bob will be willing to pay more than my minimum of $80, given the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering $95. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still ensures I make a decent profit. I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer, especially as he already lowered his price once."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only $5 more than selling to John, it's still a profit and prevents further rounds of negotiation.  There's a chance Bob might refuse to budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
