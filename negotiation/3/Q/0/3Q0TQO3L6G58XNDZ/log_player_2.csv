"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation and Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm really looking for something closer to $13,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:**  $13,500 is a good middle ground between Bob's counteroffer of $13,000 and Alice's previous offer of $14,000. 
* **It saves money compared to John:**  Accepting Alice's offer is $1,500 cheaper than buying from John.

While Bob might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars by continuing to negotiate, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of Alice walking away or John's offer becoming unavailable.  It's a good deal for both parties."
