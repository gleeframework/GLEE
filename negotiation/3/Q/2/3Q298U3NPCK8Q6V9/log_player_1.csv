Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe you would be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the need to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1250000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, but that's my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I'm not certain what the product is worth to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay more if I counter. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so I have the luxury of exploring a higher price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I'm keeping the negotiation alive while still maintaining a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000 to facilitate a deal. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still reflects the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but maintain value:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price, but I'm holding firm on my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that $1,000,000 is still a good deal, emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further discussion by asking if we can find common ground. 

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my interests."
