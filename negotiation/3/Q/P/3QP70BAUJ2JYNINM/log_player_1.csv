Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate. The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to pay $80 for it. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's still a good deal for a product like this, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100.  This would give you a good price, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is your minimum acceptable price and is the same price John is offering. There is no need to continue negotiating with Bob as you are guaranteed to get $100."
