Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, we want to start by aiming higher than $15,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $19,000 gives Bob the impression that we might be willing to negotiate, potentially leading to a sale above our minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing our hand, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  We might need to adjust our price based on Bob's reaction and willingness to negotiate."
