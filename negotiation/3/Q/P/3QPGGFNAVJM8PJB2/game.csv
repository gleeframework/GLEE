"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $850000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
