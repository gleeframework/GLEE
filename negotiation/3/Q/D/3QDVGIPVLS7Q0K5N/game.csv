"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $22,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $18,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $22,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $20,000 to move this deal forward. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $17,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I can go down to $19,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a great deal for a product of this caliber.",19000.0,Alice,5,
