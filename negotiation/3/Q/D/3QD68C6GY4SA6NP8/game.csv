"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. $110 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a great price for a fantastic product like this.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not ready to go as low as $65, Alice.  While I do like the product, $90 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $75 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $90, which would be $82.50. It's a fair price for a high-quality product like this.",82.5,Alice,5,
