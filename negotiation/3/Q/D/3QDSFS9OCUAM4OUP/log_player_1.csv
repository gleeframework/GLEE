"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value proposition of the product and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation flowing. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my earnings within the 10 rounds.  This opening offer sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation.  
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  The option to sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage. This knowledge allows me to be more confident in holding out for a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to $1,000,000, hoping to find a middle ground.  If Bob refuses to budge, I'll consider the possibility of selling to John in later rounds if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's favorable to me. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce the justification for my price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm confident in the product's worth and not desperate to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties. If Bob rejects it, I'll consider offering a slightly lower price in the next round, but I'll always be mindful of my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $950,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Building Momentum:**  Bob's willingness to increase his offer shows that he's interested in the product, and I want to continue leveraging this interest.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** The option to sell to John for $1,200,000 is a strong card I can play. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll aim for a price closer to $940,000, hoping to find a mutually agreeable compromise. If Bob refuses to budge, I'll start considering the possibility of selling to John in later rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $920,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me at $940,000? It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise that's a small step closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and create a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Maintain Pressure:**  By not immediately accepting his offer, I'm maintaining the pressure and not giving Bob the impression that I'm desperate.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but also one that's likely acceptable to Bob based on his previous counteroffer. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to start considering selling to John as we approach the middle of the rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can meet you at $940,000, but I'm willing to go to $915,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $915,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it. 
* **High Stakes:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the rounds, and I want to make sure I get the best possible price.
* **Leveraging John:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, which gives me the confidence to push for a better price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to $930,000, trying to find a middle ground.  If Bob refuses again, I'll be more likely to consider selling to John in later rounds to ensure I don't lose out on a significant profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $915,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $930,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm showing Bob that I'm still open to negotiating, but I'm not willing to budge significantly.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering $930,000 is a small step closer to Bob's offer, but it keeps me closer to my desired price.
* **Urgency:**  We're now past the halfway point of the rounds, so I'm adding a sense of urgency to the negotiation by suggesting that we find a solution ""that works for both of us.""

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach an agreeable price with Bob. If he rejects it, I'll strongly consider selling to John in the next round.  I'm running out of time and need to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $930,000. I'm willing to go to $905,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $905,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $905,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in Round 8, and Bob's offer of $905,000 is only $5,000 above his initial counteroffer. There's little room for further negotiation.
* **Significant Loss:** Accepting this offer would mean losing almost $300,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price and secures a significant profit.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I can't afford to risk losing so much money by continuing to negotiate.  John's offer provides a safe and profitable solution."
