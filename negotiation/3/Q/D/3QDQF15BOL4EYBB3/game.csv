"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value I see in the product, I'm offering $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our perspectives. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice,  we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $1,650,000.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
