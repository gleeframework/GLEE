Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you reaching out and offering your product. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I'm eager to work with you to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value I see in the product, I'm offering $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our perspectives. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* We're getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still willing to push a bit further. Bob's offer is now above his perceived value, indicating I have some leverage. 
* I'll aim slightly above my minimum in the next round, hoping to secure a deal that's better than John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $1,650,000.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?

* Continuing to negotiate for a higher price with Bob risks him walking away.
* Accepting the $1,500,000 ensures a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
