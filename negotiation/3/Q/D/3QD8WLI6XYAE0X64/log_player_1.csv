Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiation, as it leaves room for bargaining. 
* **Optimistic but Reasonable:**  $120 is within a reasonable range considering my minimum value of $100. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to establish a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $90 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:** I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price, which gives me leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value for Bob, highlighting that it's still a ""great deal"" for him. 
* **Persistence:** I'm not giving up on the negotiation, demonstrating that I'm motivated to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a risk that he might walk away, and I'd only be left with John's offer of $100. 
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing negotiations could take longer, and there's no guarantee of a higher price. 
* **Slight Profit:** While not ideal, accepting $95 still results in a small profit and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
