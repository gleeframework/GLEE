"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal!",1075000.0,Alice,3,
