,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the $15,000 offer is too low for me to consider. Could you do $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $18,000. I'd be willing to pay $16,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier.",16000.0,Bob,4,
