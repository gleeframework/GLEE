Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise considering my budget and your stated value. I believe this is a reasonable offer for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your effort to come down in price, $1,300,000 is still too far from my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  This represents a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.
