{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 119}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob without losing him as a buyer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John. 

By offering the product at $119, we are:

* **Above Bob's Valuation:**  The price is enticing enough that Bob might be willing to pay a premium over his perceived value.
* **Below Our Guarantee:** We still make a profit even if Bob rejects the offer."
