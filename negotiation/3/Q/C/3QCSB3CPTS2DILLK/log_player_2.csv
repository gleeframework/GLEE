"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial price, it's still above my $10,000 limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my limit, it's still above my $10,000 budget.  Given that I can secure the product from John for exactly my limit, it makes more sense to end the negotiation and buy from John.  Further negotiation with Alice could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also carries the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer, delaying the purchase, and potentially leading to a price increase.  Buying from John provides certainty and avoids any additional risk or hassle."
