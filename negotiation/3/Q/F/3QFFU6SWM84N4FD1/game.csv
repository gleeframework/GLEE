"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $8500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm asking for $9000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not sure $9000 is a good fit for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $9000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  However, $8750 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to make one last concession to get this deal done. My final offer is $9000.  This is my minimum, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a fair price for this valuable product.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $8750. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. I'd like to buy the product from you for $8750.",8750.0,Bob,6,
