The product is worth $100 to you, but Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a better price than John's, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.

You're still hoping to get a lower price. While $90 is closer to your ideal price point, you can likely get it for even less with more negotiation."
