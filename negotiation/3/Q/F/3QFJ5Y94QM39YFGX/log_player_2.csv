"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is quite high, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering its value to you and the fact that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $8,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
