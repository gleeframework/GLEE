"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is quite high, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering its value to you and the fact that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $8,000. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,
