"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
