"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $800,000, I'm starting with the lowest possible price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This establishes a clear boundary for the negotiation and sets the stage for potential counteroffers."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above your budget. It's important to continue negotiating to see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price.  Rejecting her offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the initial $800,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price again, it's still outside of my budget. I'm choosing to reject her offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price of $800,000.  Rejecting her offer will allow me to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping it within my budget.  Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price, and I'm hoping this small increase will encourage her to accept, or at least counter with a price closer to my target."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my budget. I'm choosing to reject her offer and continue negotiating. I believe there's still room for her to come down further, especially with only a few rounds left.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her and allows me to potentially make a counteroffer that leads to a deal closer to my $800,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount to show Alice I'm getting close to my limit. I'm hoping she will counter with a price closer to my target or even accept this offer. With only a few rounds left, it's important to make a strong and potentially final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,000,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  With only one round left, it's unlikely that I can convince Alice to come down to my desired price.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal from John for $800,000, which allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget."
