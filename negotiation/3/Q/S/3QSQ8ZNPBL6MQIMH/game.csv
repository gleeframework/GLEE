"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits higher.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,275,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while recognizing the unique advantages this product offers.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
