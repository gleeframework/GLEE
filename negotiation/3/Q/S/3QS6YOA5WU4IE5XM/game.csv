"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm sure we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant to commit at $10,750. How about we split the difference and go with $10,625?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,625. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer it to you for $11,250, which is a $625 reduction from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,875. This would be a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,875 and $11,250. I can offer it to you for $11,062.50. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and it's still a great deal for you.",11062.5,Alice,7,
