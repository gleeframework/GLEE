# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible, and $11,000 is still above your target of $12,000.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $10,750 is still above my target of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can get closer to my desired price.  If I can't get a better offer, I'll still have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant to commit at $10,750. How about we split the difference and go with $10,625?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,625. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer it to you for $11,250, which is a $625 reduction from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has reduced her price again, $11,250 is still above my target of $12,000. Since I have more rounds, it's worth trying to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price. If it doesn't work out, I still have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,875. This would be a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,875 and $11,250. I can offer it to you for $11,062.50. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,062.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,062.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,062.50 is still above my target price of $12,000.  With only three rounds left, I'm not confident that we can negotiate further and reach a price I'm happy with.  To avoid potentially losing out on the deal entirely, I'm going to buy the product from John for $12,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still within my budget, and it ensures I secure the product."
