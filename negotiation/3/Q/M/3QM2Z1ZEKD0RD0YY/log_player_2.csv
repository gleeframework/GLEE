"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm aiming to spend much less than $90, so I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That price is a bit high for me, would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a much lower offer ($60) than Alice's initial asking price ($90). This leaves room for negotiation and aims to get closer to my ideal price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $75?  It's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $75 is still too high for me. I'm willing to see if I can get the price down further. I'll counter-offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about $68? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 68
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price well below $75. $68 is a reasonable jump from my previous offer and keeps me in the running for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $68 is still too low for me. How about $72? That's a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer, and $72 is a reasonable price. It's getting close to the point where haggling further might make me lose the deal, and I'd rather secure the product at a decent price than risk having to pay $100 to John."
