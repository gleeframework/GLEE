I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. $9,500 is close to my minimum, but I think I can get him to pay a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested! However, $9,500 is a little lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? It's a fair price for this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider $9800 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise between our offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, and I'm comfortable with $9,800.  I don't want to risk losing him and ending up with the lower offer from John."
