"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000 for this product. It's a significant investment for me, and this price would make it more feasible. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to make a significant investment, but I need to ensure that I get a fair price for the product. Considering your initial offer was lower than my initial price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially increasing her price again, or simply refusing to negotiate further, makes accepting the current offer the most logical choice.  Bob is securing a good deal while minimizing potential risk."
