Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am only willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. This price aligns better with its value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $950,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than my asking price, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am able to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This price still allows me to stay within my budget while also providing a fair return for you. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,000,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I am willing to pay $1,010,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our respective values. I hope this offer will lead to a successful conclusion of our negotiations.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,010,000 is getting closer, I'm not comfortable selling for that low of a price.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk further haggling with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a sure thing, and it gets me closer to my target value."
