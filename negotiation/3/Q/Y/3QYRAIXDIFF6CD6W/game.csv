"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than my asking price, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
