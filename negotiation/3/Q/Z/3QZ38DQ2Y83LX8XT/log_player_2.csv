**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth attempting one more counteroffer before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,100,000 still falls short of my minimum requirements. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,125,000, a significant move on my part. This shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's unlikely that further negotiation will bring the price down to an acceptable level. It's time to stop the negotiation with Alice and purchase the product from John."
