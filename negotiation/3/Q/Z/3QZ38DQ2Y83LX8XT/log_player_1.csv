{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message explicitly invites Bob to respond, signaling I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on my goal of maximizing profit. If his counteroffer is too low, I can either try to negotiate further or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and gives you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John at this point would guarantee my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up on maximizing my profit through negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting that the new price is fair for both of us, emphasizing a win-win situation.
* **Open to Agreement:** I'm using language that encourages Bob to see this as a potential point of agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my goal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating or if it's time to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product, which is a significant amount considering my limit.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there is still room for improvement in the price. I'm not ready to settle for a lower price just yet.
* **Balancing Risks:**  Selling to John guarantees a secure profit, but I'm still motivated to push for a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. I'll need to carefully consider the risk of losing Bob as a buyer, but also the potential for a better deal."
