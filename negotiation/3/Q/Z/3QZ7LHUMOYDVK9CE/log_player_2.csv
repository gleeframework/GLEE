"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is lower than John's price of $100, you know Alice values the product at $80.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price."
