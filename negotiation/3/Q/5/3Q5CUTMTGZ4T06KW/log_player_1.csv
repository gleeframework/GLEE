"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** Emphasizing that the price is a good deal for both of us encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm prepared for Bob to counter, so I'm not setting a hardline price that would likely end the negotiation prematurely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a higher price.  I want to see if I can close the deal with him for more than $850,000.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can explore other options, potentially getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:**  I acknowledge Bob's desire for a lower price, showing I'm listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Presenting a compromise:** Offering a lower price than my initial offer demonstrates flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, appealing to his interests. 
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to continue the negotiation, aiming for a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle just yet.  I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 

By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and explore a potential compromise that might be closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $875,000.  I'm still a bit hesitant to accept that price. I'm willing to go down to $890,000.  This is a very reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:** I acknowledge Bob's willingness to compromise, showing I'm listening and  responsive.
* **Meeting him halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my last offer and his, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  I'm again framing the offer as a ""win-win"", appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Urging closure:**  I'm suggesting a final agreement, emphasizing the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $890000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $882500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd like to keep pushing for a higher price, Bob's offer of $882,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will walk away if I continue to reject his offers.  

Therefore, it's strategically sound to accept his offer. It guarantees me a decent profit while also avoiding the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to settle for John's lower offer."
