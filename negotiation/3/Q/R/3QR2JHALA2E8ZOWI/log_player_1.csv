Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and to make it a great deal, I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have insider information that the product is worth $150 to Bob. This is a significant advantage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start higher, aiming for around 80% of Bob's perceived value ($120) is a strong opening. It suggests a deal, but leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and still land within a price range very profitable for you.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John ($80), but aiming higher with Bob is key to maximizing your profit."
