"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject the offer. The product is only worth $8,000 to him, and Alice is asking for $9,000. There is room for negotiation. It's better to try to get a better price from Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's still room to negotiate, and Bob should try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
