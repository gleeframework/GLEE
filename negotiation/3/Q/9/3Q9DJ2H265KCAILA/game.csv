"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm not able to go down to $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still unable to meet at $9,000. Could we possibly aim for $8,500? That would be the highest I could realistically consider.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a strict budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This is a truly unique product that will be a great asset for your business, and I believe it's worth the investment.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Alice,5,
