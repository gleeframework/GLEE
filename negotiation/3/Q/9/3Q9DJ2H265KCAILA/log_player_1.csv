{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum of $12,000, leaving you room to negotiate if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While selling to Bob for $8,000 would be better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000 and also less than John's offer.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by sending Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm not able to go down to $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It shows flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by moving from my initial offer of $10,000.
* **It's still above Bob's offer:**  I'm not giving away too much. 
* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  $9,000 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **It reinforces the value proposition:**  I reiterate that this is a good deal for Bob.

Let's see if Bob accepts my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still unable to meet at $9,000. Could we possibly aim for $8,500? That would be the highest I could realistically consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still a significant loss compared to John's offer. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a strict budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This is a truly unique product that will be a great asset for your business, and I believe it's worth the investment.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This is my final counteroffer, and here's why:

* **Pushing for a reasonable compromise:** $9,500 is only $500 away from my minimum and only $1,000 away from John's offer. It's a strong attempt to get a price I'm happy with.
* **Highlighting the value:** I remind Bob of the product's benefits to emphasize its worth.
* **Setting a clear boundary:** I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't accept this offer. This creates urgency and potential for a deal.

Let's see if Bob accepts my final offer!"
