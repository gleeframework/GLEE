Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd be willing to accept from John. This allows for some room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing the offer as a ""great deal"". 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, indicating I'm willing to find a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:**  Even if I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can still sell to John for $100. This gives me leverage.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and leave open the possibility of a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good price, I'm looking for a bit more. How about $95? That's halfway between our two offers, and I'm sure we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:**  $95 is a compromise, but it's still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Positive and constructive:**  I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation friendly and reiterate my interest in finding a solution.
* **Reframing the offer:**  I'm presenting $95 as a ""halfway"" point, emphasizing its fairness and making it more appealing to Bob.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $92 is only $8 away from my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for a quick sale:** Accepting Bob's offer means a quick and easy sale, potentially saving time and effort.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Even if I don't reach a better price with Bob, I can still fall back on John's offer of $100. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting $92 is a reasonable compromise that ensures a sale without risking losing the deal entirely."
