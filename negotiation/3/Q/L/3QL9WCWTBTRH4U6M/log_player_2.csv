"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. Rejecting gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product.  While I agree it looks great, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A strong counteroffer helps understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Work towards a favorable price:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets the stage for future rounds to reach a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your budget, but the offer is still higher than John's price. Rejecting and providing a counteroffer keeps the negotiation open with the potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We continue to negotiate, moving closer to Alice's price while staying below our absolute limit (John's price). This approach aims to:

*  **Signal seriousness:** By incrementally increasing our offer, we demonstrate our genuine interest in the product.
*  **Find a middle ground:** We're aiming for a price that works for both parties while still saving money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $12,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $12,500.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price or the time invested in more rounds of negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, which is better than Alice's current offer."
