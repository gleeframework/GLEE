"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price. Starting with a low counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Open:**  While our offer is low, we maintain a polite tone to keep the negotiation amicable.  We want Alice to feel like we're serious about buying but also serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $60 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has come down significantly from $110 to $90. This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room to Negotiate:** We're still aiming to get the price closer to $80. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Alternative:**  We have John's offer as a backup, so we're not desperate to accept a price we're not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $75, we're splitting the difference between her current offer ($90) and our previous offer ($60). This is a common negotiation tactic and often perceived as fair.
* **Justification:** We're providing a reason for our counter-offer (""a fair price for both of us"") to make it more convincing. 
* **Urgency:** While we haven't explicitly mentioned a deadline, each round implies we're closer to walking away and taking John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  While $85 is slightly above our ideal price, it's close enough to John's offer of $80. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result.
* **Time Investment:** We've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now saves time and avoids the risk of Alice raising her price again. 
* **Relationship:** Accepting Alice's compromise shows we're willing to meet her halfway and builds goodwill for a potential future interaction."
