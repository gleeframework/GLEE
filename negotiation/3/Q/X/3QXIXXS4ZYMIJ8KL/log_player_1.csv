Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,800 is getting close to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still not convinced I can't get closer to my desired price. We're running out of rounds, but I'll try one more counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

We're down to the wire and Bob is not budging. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John rather than risk ending up with nothing."
