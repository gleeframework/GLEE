Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. I'll offer him the product for $150.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is $120, which is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum value of the product to me ($120). I'll choose option (3) and sell the product to John for $120.
