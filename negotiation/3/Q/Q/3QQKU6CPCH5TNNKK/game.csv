"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This represents a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the market. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds $850,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the market. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
