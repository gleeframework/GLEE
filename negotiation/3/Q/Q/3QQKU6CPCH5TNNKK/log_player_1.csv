Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This represents a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the market. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds $850,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the market. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $850,000 and unwilling to budge. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap between his valuation and my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). Accepting his offer represents a significant loss.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to cease negotiations with Bob and sell to John, who is offering my full asking price."
