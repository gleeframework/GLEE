"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's too risky to accept the offer, as it would result in a significant financial loss for Bob. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This represents a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the market. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds $850,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's a slight improvement, it's still too risky to accept. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price closer to his maximum budget."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the market. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 850000}
