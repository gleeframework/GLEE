Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **Your Value:** You value the product at a minimum of $8,000.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $8,000.

By offering $12,000, you:

* **Maximize Profit:** You earn significantly more than your minimum value and get closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Increase Chances of Acceptance:** Bob has a strong incentive to accept as he still gets a good deal. 
* **Minimize Risk:**  If Bob rejects, you still have John's offer as a safety net."
