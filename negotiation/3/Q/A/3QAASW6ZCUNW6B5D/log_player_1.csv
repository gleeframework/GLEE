Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is my minimum, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this is a good enough incentive for Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal of $150, Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer of $125 will guarantee a sale and is better than selling to John for $120."
