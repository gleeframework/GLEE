Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,750. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is firm on her minimum of $11,750. This is still above Bob's target price, and he's already spent several rounds trying to get a better deal. 

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees he gets the product at his desired price and saves him time and effort in further negotiation."
