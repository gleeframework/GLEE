"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. Given its value, I think a price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better. He has a fallback option with John for $12,000, so he has room to negotiate with Alice."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's gotten the price down to $11,000, which is better than his fallback price of $12,000 with John.  There's no guarantee he can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
