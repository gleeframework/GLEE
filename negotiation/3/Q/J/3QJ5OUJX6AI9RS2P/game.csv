"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of $500,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a fair deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I'm looking to spend.  To be honest, I'd be willing to go up to $650,000, but if we can't find an agreement near there, I might have to explore other options.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. It seems we're still quite far apart in our valuations.  I'm willing to make one final significant move to bridge the gap.  Would you consider $1,700,000? This is my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair offer given the product's potential.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down that far.  However, that price is still too high for me. I can offer $700,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I will have to go with a different seller.",700000.0,Bob,6,
