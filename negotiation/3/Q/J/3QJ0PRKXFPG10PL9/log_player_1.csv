Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000 is a good starting point.**  It's a fair price that's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  It emphasizes the value of the product and doesn't put pressure on Bob.

**Strategy:**

By starting at $11,000, I'm giving myself a good chance of getting a price closer to my desired $12,000.  If Bob rejects, I'll have the option to counter, or go to John if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500 is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, and even lower than Bob's own perceived value of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he clearly wants the product. This gives me leverage to counter and try to get a better price.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and explore a price closer to my desired outcome. I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $10,500 - $11,000 to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference? I'll accept $10,500. This would still leave me with a good profit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to be flexible and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Fair price:**  $10,500 is a fair price that bridges the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price.  It's also still above Bob's perceived value of the product, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains positive and encouraging, keeping the negotiation open and friendly. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance:

*  It's higher than Bob's initial offer, making it more appealing.
*  It's still significantly lower than my ideal price, leaving room for potential future negotiation.

I'm confident that $10,500 is a reasonable price, but I'll be ready to adjust further if necessary based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $10,000? It's the most I can afford, but I really want this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is at his perceived value.**  While it's still below my ideal price, it's also what Bob believes the product is worth. This means there's little room for further negotiation without risking losing the deal.
* **Selling to John is not guaranteed.**  Although I can sell to John for $12,000, there's always a chance the deal might fall through or John might change his mind.  
* **Securing a sale is important.**  At this point, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, which is more beneficial than risking the uncertainty of further negotiation or waiting for a potential deal with John.

**Strategy:**

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It allows me to secure a sale at a price that is fair considering Bob's limitations and my own desire for a quick transaction.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a smart decision that minimizes risk and guarantees a profit."
