"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave some room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend less than $80. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for so much less than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll need to see a higher offer from Bob.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $100, which is a safe and guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $75 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $82 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $82 is getting very close to my minimum and it's getting late in the negotiations. There's a good chance he won't budge further, and I'm already at a point where I'm making a decent profit. It's better to accept this offer and close the deal than risk getting a worse offer or running out of rounds."
