"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,700,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move things forward, I can come down to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet halfway at $1,075,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, $1,075,000 is still significantly higher than our walk-away price of $800,000.  We have time to negotiate, and there's a chance Alice will be willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but that price is still a bit too rich for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  This offer stands until the end of the next round."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** We're making a final offer at our maximum budget. This shows Alice we're serious but also unwilling to budge further.
* **Time constraint:**  Adding a time constraint can push Alice to make a decision quickly. It also signals that we might walk away and buy from John if she doesn't agree. 
* **Transparency:** Being open about our budget can sometimes help move negotiations along. Alice knows exactly where we stand."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be straightforward.  $800,000 is simply too far below its value. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,000,000.  This is my absolute best offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,000,000, and we can't go above $800,000.  
* **Walk-away price:** We have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice when we can get our desired price elsewhere. 
* **Limited rounds:** We're running out of rounds, and continuing with Alice carries the risk that she won't budge, forcing us to buy from John at the last minute anyway."
