"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,700,000 is fair. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move things forward, I can come down to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. $1,400,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet halfway at $1,075,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but that price is still a bit too rich for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  This offer stands until the end of the next round.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be straightforward.  $800,000 is simply too far below its value. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,000,000.  This is my absolute best offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
