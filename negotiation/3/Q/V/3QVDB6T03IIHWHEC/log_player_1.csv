Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. 
* **Justification:**  Using phrases like ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant returns"" attempts to reframe the value in Bob's mind without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity can encourage quicker decision-making.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying significantly above your guaranteed sale price to John.

**Important Considerations:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit, but there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. It's crucial to gauge Bob's personality and negotiation style beforehand, if possible. A softer approach with a lower initial price might be more effective depending on the situation."
