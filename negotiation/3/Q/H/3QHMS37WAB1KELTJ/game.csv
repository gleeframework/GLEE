"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could we settle at $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the high-quality product you'll be getting.",8200.0,Alice,5,
