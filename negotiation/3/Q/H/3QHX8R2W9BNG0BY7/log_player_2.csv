"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

The product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's offering it for $200. This means she's already pricing it above her value.  You're only willing to spend $100, so accepting her offer is out of the question. Buying from John is a good backup plan, but there's room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand it's valuable to you, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price of $100. While it's closer to my value, there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not in a rush to close the deal. I want to see if I can get her closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $140. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
