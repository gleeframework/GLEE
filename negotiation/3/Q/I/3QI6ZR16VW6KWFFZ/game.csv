"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value of similar products. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000.

I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this point.",825000.0,Alice,3,
