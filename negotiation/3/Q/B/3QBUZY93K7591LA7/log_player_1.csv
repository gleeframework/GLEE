"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to Bob's input to encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. It's worth exploring further negotiations to see if we can reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This price is still fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price closer to my minimum while still showing flexibility and being open to further negotiations. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make my price seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I have time and it seems like Bob is serious about buying the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal.  I'm willing to go down to $85, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing that this is a compromise and that I'm trying to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to work with me.  I'd be happy to meet you halfway at $77.50.  That would seal the deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $77.5 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I have a few rounds left and John is always an option if the deal falls through. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your eagerness to close the deal.  I'm willing to go down to $80, which is the lowest I can go.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm offering my minimum price, which is still above what Bob offered, but it might be enough to convince him to close the deal.  I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to create a sense of urgency."
