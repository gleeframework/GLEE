"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiations. It also gives me room to lower the price if necessary without dipping below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll be carefully watching Bob's reaction to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm definitely not accepting that. While $1,500,000 from John is tempting, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still well above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  It's tempting to sell to John for $1,500,000 but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see where this takes us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I still believe I can get a better price than John's offer. I'm going to see if this price is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to make another counteroffer. I'm starting to run out of time, so I need to find a way to close the deal quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,450,000. This is getting closer to John's offer, but I still think I can get a better price. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping it will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's getting really close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  John's offer is a safe bet, and it's still a decent profit.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get more from Bob, it's time to cut my losses and move on."
