Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  $120 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I have room to potentially accept a counteroffer if needed. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll counter again, but if it gets close to my minimum price or seems reasonable, I might accept it to avoid losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $90 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Counter-Offer Potential:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150, so I shouldn't settle for a significantly lower price unless I'm confident I can get closer to $150 through further negotiation.

**Next Step:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired $150, hoping to secure a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than I can go right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards My Goal:** This counteroffer takes me closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Staying Above Bob's Value:** $105 is still above Bob's perceived value of $80, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  The message remains positive and encouraging to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

**Next Step:** 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will assess his next counteroffer carefully. I'll consider how much closer it gets to my desired price and how willing I am to risk losing the deal if I don't accept it. I'll also keep John's offer of $150 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150. This makes taking a significant loss on the deal with Bob less appealing.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While $95 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price. 

**Next Step:**  I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired $150. I will need to be strategic and assess how much risk I'm willing to take to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle again at $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to $150:** $100 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's a compromise that's closer to what I'm looking for. 
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** While John's offer of $150 is tempting, I'm still trying to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Keeping the Negotiation Going:** By offering a middle ground, I'm showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide if it's worth making a final counteroffer. I'll consider how much risk I'm willing to take and whether I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* If I don't accept Bob's next offer, I'll sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $92. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:**  $92 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **John's Offer:** With John's guaranteed offer of $150, there's no reason to risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Low Likelihood of Improvement:** Bob has made it clear that $92 is his limit.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly higher price. 

**Conclusion:** It's time to secure a guaranteed sale with John and avoid potentially losing even more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
