"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great price for a product worth more to me.  Let's work together to find a deal that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $125 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  How about $95? That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  However, $95 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $110, which is a significant compromise from my end.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
