"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  I think it's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $80."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great price for a product worth more to me.  Let's work together to find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $125 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  How about $95? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  However, $95 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $110, which is a significant compromise from my end.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer.  It's unlikely Alice will come down to $100 in the remaining rounds, so it makes more financial sense to buy from John and secure the product at the best price."
