"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This is my final offer on the lower end of the spectrum, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $800,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to negotiate a lower price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",775000.0,Alice,5,
