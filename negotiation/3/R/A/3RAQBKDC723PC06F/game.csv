"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair reflection of its true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me right now. How about we start the negotiations at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  While I recognize the value, $1,050,000 is still pushing my budget. Could we settle on $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,020,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
