Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me right now. How about we start the negotiations at $800,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
