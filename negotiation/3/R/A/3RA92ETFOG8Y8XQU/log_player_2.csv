"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $12,500? It's still a good price for you and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is cutting it a bit close to my minimum.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $13,250.** This is still lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Bob has already made a counteroffer and been rejected.** It's unlikely that he can get a significantly lower price than $13,250 without further negotiation rounds, which could risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,750 compared to buying from John.** This is a significant savings for Bob. 

While Bob could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are not large enough to outweigh the risk of losing the deal with Alice."
