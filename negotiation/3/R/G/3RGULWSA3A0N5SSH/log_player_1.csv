Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850000. This reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.
