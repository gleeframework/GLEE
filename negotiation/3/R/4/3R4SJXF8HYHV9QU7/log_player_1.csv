Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than both my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give me insight into his level of interest and flexibility. If he accepts, I exceed my minimum. If he negotiates, we can find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net. This allows me to confidently aim for a higher price with Bob without the risk of losing the sale entirely."
