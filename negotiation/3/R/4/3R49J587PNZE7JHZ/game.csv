"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm working with a strict budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? It's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tight budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
