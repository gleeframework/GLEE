"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value, I propose a price of $120 for it. This reflects not only its worth but also the opportunity to secure it now at an exclusive rate.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $95, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $105 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still reflecting the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is my absolute limit. If you're agreeable to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider purchasing from John.",100.0,Bob,4,
