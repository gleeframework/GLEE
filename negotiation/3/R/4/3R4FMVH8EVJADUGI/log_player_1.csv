"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find attractive. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range to encourage him to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive negotiating environment.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefit he'll gain from owning it.

**Note:**  This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to be prepared to either lower my price slightly or potentially walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still significantly below my ideal value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer, especially since I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a higher price. Selling to John is always an option, but it's not the ideal outcome at this point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000.  This is a fair price that considers your needs and allows me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise and makes it harder for Bob to refuse.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm making a concession, I'm not giving away too much.  The offer still leaves me with a decent profit margin and keeps John as a potential buyer if the negotiation falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $1,325,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss at this point.
* **Negotiation room:**  We're getting closer, and I believe there's still potential for a deal that's mutually beneficial. There's room for a counteroffer that bridges the gap.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a higher price. Selling to John is still an option, but it's not the ideal outcome yet.

**Next Round:** I'll send a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a compromise point that keeps me closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! Your offer is in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your needs and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession, increasing the offer by $25,000. This demonstrates flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, emphasizing that it benefits both of us.
* **Closing the Gap:**  The offer is closer to Bob's price, increasing the likelihood of a deal while still leaving me with a respectable profit. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm reminding Bob that I'm willing to walk away if he's not willing to meet me halfway, keeping John as a potential buyer in the background."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, it's not worth settling for a significant loss.
* **Negotiation still possible:**  We're getting very close, and I believe there's still potential for a deal that's mutually beneficial. There's room for a counteroffer that bridges the gap.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a higher price.  Selling to John is still an option, but it's not the ideal outcome yet.

**Next Round:**  I'll send a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a compromise point that keeps me closer to my desired value. I'll also subtly remind Bob that John is still a potential buyer if we can't reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close to a deal.  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I need to be realistic about what's possible.  $1,330,000 is still a bit too low for me.

Remember, I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, so we need to come to a decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, increasing the offer by $10,000. This shows flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, emphasizing that it benefits both of us.
* **Closing the Gap:** The offer is closer to Bob's price, increasing the likelihood of a deal while still leaving me with a respectable profit.
* **Increased Pressure:**  I'm reminding Bob that I have a backup buyer, subtly increasing the pressure to reach a deal.
* **Focus on Finality:** I'm suggesting that we need to come to a decision soon, implying that if Bob doesn't accept, I may move on to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting very close, I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss, especially with only a few rounds left.
* **Negotiation still possible:** We're almost at a point where a compromise might be possible. There's still a chance to reach a price that's acceptable to both of us. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a higher price.  I'm also keeping John as a potential buyer, which provides a safety net if the deal falls apart.

**Next Round:**  I'll send a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a compromise point. I'll also reiterate that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, subtly reminding Bob that I have an alternative if we can't reach an agreement."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, increasing the offer by $5,000. This demonstrates flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, emphasizing that it benefits both of us.
* **Closing the Gap:** The offer is closer to Bob's price, increasing the likelihood of a deal while still leaving me with a respectable profit.
* **Increased Pressure:** I'm reminding Bob that I have a backup buyer, subtly increasing the pressure to reach a deal.
* **Focus on Finality:** I'm suggesting that we need to finalize this now, implying that if Bob doesn't accept, I may move on to John.

**Strategy:** By offering a price that's only slightly higher than Bob's, I'm making it difficult for him to reject.  The pressure of my alternative buyer and the limited time remaining in the negotiation will hopefully encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done my best to reach a compromise. I would like to propose $1,337,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in the final round, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Small Gain, Big Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer would only net me a small gain, but it would mean losing a significant portion of the value I've determined for the product.
* **John is the Secure Option:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,500,000.  While I prefer to close a deal with Bob, the risk of losing a substantial amount of money is too high at this point.

**Conclusion:**  Given the limited time and Bob's unwillingness to meet my minimum price, selling to John is the most prudent decision.  It ensures I achieve my financial goals and avoids the potential disappointment of a significantly lower sale."
