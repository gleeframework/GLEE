"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to consider your suggestion of $900,000. However, I still feel that this might be a bit out of my range. I propose a counteroffer of $875,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're comfortable with.",875000.0,Bob,4,
