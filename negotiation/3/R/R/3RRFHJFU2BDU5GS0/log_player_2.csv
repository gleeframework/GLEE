You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to you and Alice is offering the same price, there's no benefit to buying from her. You can get the product at the same price from John, so buying from John is the optimal strategy to save money."
