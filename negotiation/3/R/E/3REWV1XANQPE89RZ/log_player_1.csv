Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to Bob. This allows room for negotiation, but also ensures I start at a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $80 is quite a jump.  How about we split the difference closer to your price at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at the minimum of what the product is worth to me. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking a further negotiation that might result in a lower price or no deal at all."
