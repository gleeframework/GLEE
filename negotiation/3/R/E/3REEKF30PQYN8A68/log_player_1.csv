"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a strong opening position that sets a high bar for the negotiation. It's also important to remember that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob for a low price.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I believe I can get closer to that value. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $8,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I will make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm going to counter with $7,500.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still holding firm to getting a good price for my product.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,200 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7300}
```

I'm counteroffering with $7,300.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to secure a good price.  With only a few rounds left, I want to ensure we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will meet my desired price.  We only have a few rounds left, and the negotiation is becoming more tense. I don't want to risk losing out on a better price, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further potential losses."
