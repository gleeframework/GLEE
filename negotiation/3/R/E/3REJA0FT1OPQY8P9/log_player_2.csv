"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Since he has a backup option of buying from John for $12,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get the price down quickly.  He's giving Alice a reason for his counter (budget constraints) and opening the door for negotiation."
