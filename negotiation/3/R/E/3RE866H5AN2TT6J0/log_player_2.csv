* **More negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  While John's offer is a safety net, you're aiming for a lower price."

{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  Starting with a significant counteroffer shows you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer is still within a reasonable range for Alice, leaving space for a few more counteroffers before either party needs to walk away. 
* **Staying below John's price:** This price is still significantly lower than John's, making it worthwhile to keep negotiating with Alice."

* **Remaining below John's price:** This offer is still significantly better than what John is offering, keeping the negotiation with Alice worthwhile."
