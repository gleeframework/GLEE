"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower offer, closer to her $8,000 value. Even if she doesn't budge, you're not losing anything by going with John."
