"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's estimated value but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point while also showing I'm open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial value, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price a bit more, showing a willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given Bob's counteroffer.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is getting closer to Bob's initial value, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting.  I want to maximize my profits and see if I can push Bob further.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm aiming to meet Bob in the middle. $9,500 is a decent compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still achieving a decent profit. This move aims to close the deal quickly in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is now equal to his initial value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already gone through several rounds, and it seems unlikely that Bob will offer more. I'm losing valuable time and it's clear that a deal won't happen soon. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me the best possible price and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
