"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm happy to pay $95. It's a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $100? I think that's a reasonable compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at this price.",100.0,Alice,5,
