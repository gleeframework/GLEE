"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in great condition and worth every penny! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice. You can offer less than $95 and see if she'll budge."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about $90?  That would be a fair compromise and still give you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

You're still saving $10 compared to buying from John, but it's worth trying to get closer to your ideal price. You can likely get Alice down to $88 or $89."
