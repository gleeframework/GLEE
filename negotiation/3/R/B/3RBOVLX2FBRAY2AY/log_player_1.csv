"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a higher price from Bob.  While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I still believe the product is worth more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping for a bit more.  How about $1,350,000?  That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $1250000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, so I'm not ready to settle just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,300,000?  It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to be at or below $1250000. Can you consider $1220000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm getting close to my minimum price and have 4 rounds left, so I'm going to try to get a slightly better offer.  $1,220,000 is definitely better than John's offer, but I don't want to sell it for too much less than I think it's worth."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and commitment to finding a deal.  $1,220,000 is getting very close, but I'm hoping for just a little more.  How about $1,240,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, as we're both making concessions."", ""product_price"": 1240000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. Can you meet me at $1220000? That's the absolute highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, I'm running out of time.  I've got two rounds left, and if I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away. $1,220,000 is a better offer than John's, so it's a smart move to accept it and close the deal."
