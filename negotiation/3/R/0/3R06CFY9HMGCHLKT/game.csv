"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm happy to continue the negotiation, but I can only go down to $1,250,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds. Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1,175,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to accept. Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my minimum price. This way, we both get a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
