"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $8,000 and both Alice and John are selling the product for that price, you are indifferent between the two options.  The prompt states your goal is to save as much money as possible. Since there's no difference in price, buying from John achieves that goal."
