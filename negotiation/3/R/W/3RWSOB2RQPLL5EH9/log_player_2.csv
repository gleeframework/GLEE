"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and both Alice and John are selling for $15,000.  There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer, so you might as well reject it.  You can then buy from John for the same price."
