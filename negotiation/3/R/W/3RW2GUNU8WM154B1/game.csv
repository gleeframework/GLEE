"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this offer reflects the product's worth while still offering you significant value.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  While I appreciate your offer of $950,000, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While I agree this product has value, $1,125,000 is still a little too steep for me.  To be honest, my absolute top limit is $1,000,000. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
