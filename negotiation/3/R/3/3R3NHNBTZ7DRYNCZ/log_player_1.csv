Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't just throw out a number. It emphasizes ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to create a perception of higher worth in Bob's mind.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, Alice has a safety net with John. This strategy aims for maximizing profit if Bob is willing to negotiate near Alice's desired range. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and knowledge of Bob's negotiation style, other strategies might be more appropriate."
