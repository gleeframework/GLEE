{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $100, which is your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for him to counteroffer, and for you to adjust your price. 
* **It's a fair price:**  It's not too aggressive, and leaves a potential profit for both of you. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure if $140 is the best deal I can get. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still below your desired profit margin.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to get closer to your desired price.  You can counter with a price slightly lower than your initial offer, but still higher than $120.  This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Bob that you're willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $130?  That would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 isn't ideal, it's a good compromise. Here's why:

* **Profit Margin:** You'll still make a profit of $25, which is better than selling to John for $100.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's also a chance that Bob will walk away completely, leaving you with no sale.  
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming, and you might be better off closing the deal and moving on to other opportunities.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale and a reasonable profit."
