Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering it at $1,000,000 (Bob's value) is unlikely to be accepted as it leaves no room for negotiation or profit for Alice. On the other hand, starting too high might discourage Bob immediately.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 positions the price significantly above Bob's perceived value but still offers a substantial discount compared to what John is willing to pay. This creates an incentive for Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The message is framed as a starting point for negotiation, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
