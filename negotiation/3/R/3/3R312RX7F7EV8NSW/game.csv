"Bob, I've already told you that $1200000 is my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think you're getting a great deal at this price, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by including some additional services that will save you time and money in the long run. Let's meet at $1280000 and I'll throw in the extras. That's my final offer.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
