Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high but reasonable starting point:**  Starting at $9,000 gives room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Creating a sense of value:** Highlighting your belief in the product's worth ($10,000) aims to influence Bob's perception of its value.
* **Introducing a mild sense of urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly, potentially preventing him from overthinking or shopping around.

This strategy balances maximizing profit potential with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.  If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price."
