"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I can do $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I think you know that's the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. If we can't agree on that, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
