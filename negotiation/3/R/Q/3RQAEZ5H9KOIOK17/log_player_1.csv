{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This creates room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This offer leaves enough space for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. It also leaves me room to adjust my price if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a good rapport with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the initial offer. I'll need to be flexible and adaptable depending on Bob's response and my goal of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, potentially bridging the gap.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is guaranteed, I'm not ready to settle yet. There's a chance I can negotiate a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $950,000, but leaving room for further negotiation. I want to find a price that satisfies both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but not settling:**  I've lowered my price from $950,000 to $900,000, showing a willingness to compromise.  This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so I'm not giving away the farm.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  My message is still positive and encourages further negotiation. I want to keep the door open for a mutually agreeable solution.

**Important Note:**  I'm still keeping my eye on John's offer of $1,000,000. If Bob doesn't come closer to my price, I'm prepared to walk away and take the guaranteed deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer even further, potentially forcing me to accept a price that's too low. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Given the current situation, I believe it's more advantageous to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit. Further negotiation with Bob carries too much risk of ending up with a deal that's less favorable."
