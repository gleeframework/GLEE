Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,000. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

Bob should buy the product from John. Even though Alice's offer is closer to his target price, it's still higher than his maximum budget and he has already made 5 rounds of negotiation.  He can buy the product from John at his desired price, saving himself further negotiation rounds and potential risks of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
