"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is far too high for Bob's budget. It's in his best interest to reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8000 is unfortunately not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down in price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's budget.  It's worth exploring further negotiation to try and get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10000 is a step in the right direction,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a good value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to his desired price point, but $13,000 is still more than he wants to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $11,000, which is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but $11000 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a good value for you.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down to $12,000, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  There are still a few rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Bob can aim for $11,500 or $11,000 in the next round."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $12,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to offer $11,500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
