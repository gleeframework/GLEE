"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close a deal, $8,000 is far too low for me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is unfortunately not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I need to get closer to my target price. I'll reject and counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is a step in the right direction,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a good value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $11000, which is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

While $11,000 is better than Bob's previous offers, it's still below my minimum. I need to see if I can push for a bit more. I'll reject and counteroffer again."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $11,000 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a good value for you.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $12000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to offer $11500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting closer to a deal, but it's taking a lot of rounds and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether. I'll sell to John for $15,000, which is a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum requirement."
