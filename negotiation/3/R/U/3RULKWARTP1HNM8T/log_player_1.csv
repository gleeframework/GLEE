I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I also have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation fails, so I'm not taking a huge risk with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's not worth it to accept his offer. I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,200,000.  This is still above my minimum acceptable value and reflects that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that undervalues the product. This counteroffer gives Bob a better price than my initial offer, while still keeping the negotiation within a range I find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
