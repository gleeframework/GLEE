"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a better price.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product has to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to negotiate. 
* **Positive tone:**  A positive and collaborative tone sets the stage for a successful negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he rejects, I'll likely lower my offer slightly, but remain firm on my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate.  While I don't want to drag it out, rejecting this low offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. I want to see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This takes into account your interest and allows us to both benefit from this deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm lowering my price from $950,000 to $850,000, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a way for both of us to win, highlighting the value the product offers to Bob.
* **Call to action:** I'm encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer and move towards a deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects again, I might lower my offer a bit more, but I'll be prepared to walk away if he's unwilling to come closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground.  To be honest, I'm working with a tight budget. Could we possibly do $775,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I have 6 rounds left.  Rejecting this offer maintains my leverage and shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Potential for compromise:**  While Bob is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for a compromise that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still above his offer. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's close this gap and finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $850,000 to $825,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I highlight that this is a ""significant compromise"" on my end, hoping to encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Focus on closing the deal:** I reiterate my commitment to reaching a deal, aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I will need to carefully consider my options. I may need to lower my offer further, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary, especially if the remaining rounds are limited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close. Let's wrap this up.  How about $800,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is of the essence:** With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal. 
* **John's offer:**  Although I can sell to John for the same price, there's no guarantee that a deal with John will be as straightforward or as profitable in the long run. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the deal with Bob and move forward with the transaction. I've successfully negotiated a fair price within my acceptable range."
