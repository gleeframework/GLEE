"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value and my own financial limitations.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $2,300,000 represents my initial assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,650,000, which is a fair compromise. This offer reflects the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's try $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while recognizing your budget.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
