"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential for growth you mentioned.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is a significant offer, it's unfortunately below the value I'm seeking for this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1750000.  This still allows for a substantial profit for you, while acknowledging the unique potential of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1500000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget constraints.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
