"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product and am willing to pay up to $850,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $975,000 is still higher than my maximum budget.  I can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $975,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above my budget, and I'm not sure how much further she'll go. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's likely the price won't come down to my maximum of $800,000. It's time to secure the product from John at a price I'm comfortable with."
