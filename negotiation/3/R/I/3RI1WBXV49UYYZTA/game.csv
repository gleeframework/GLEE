"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product and am willing to pay up to $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $975,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Alice,5,
