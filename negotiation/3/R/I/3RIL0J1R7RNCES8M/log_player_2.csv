"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both my maximum and her minimum. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $100 for it. Can we meet at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not close enough to her minimum for me to feel comfortable accepting. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle this at $95? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go to $95 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get as close to the value I know the product has for you as possible. How about we meet at $98? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and while I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $98.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise to ensure I get the product at a significant discount from John's price."
