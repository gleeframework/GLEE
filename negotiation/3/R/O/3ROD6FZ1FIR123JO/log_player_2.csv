Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product to you. It is an exceptional opportunity that could significantly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, we are offering it to you for $950,000. We believe this price reflects the quality and potential return on investment. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  There are 9 more rounds, providing opportunities to negotiate a better price with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore counter-offers and potentially secure a deal closer to his desired price."
