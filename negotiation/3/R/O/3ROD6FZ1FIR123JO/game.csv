"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a significant investment for me and demonstrates my seriousness about acquiring your product. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's beneficial for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this point.",875000.0,Bob,4,
