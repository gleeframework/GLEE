prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob declines, so this is your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  Any price within this range could be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can make a real difference in your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,450,000 is a strong starting point, leaving you room to negotiate down if needed while still exceeding your minimum.
* **No Justification:** You don't need to justify the price immediately. Let Bob respond first.

**Important Note:**  Bob might try to negotiate. Be prepared to counter-offer, but remember, you have John as a backup. Don't go below $1,500,000 unless Bob presents a very compelling case."
