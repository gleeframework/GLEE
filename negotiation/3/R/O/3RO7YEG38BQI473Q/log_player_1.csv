Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, which is likely to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob while also emphasizing my own needs.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob accepts, great!  
* **Open the negotiation:** If Bob rejects, we can use his counteroffer to gauge his seriousness and willingness to pay.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I'm willing to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product to me and a fair return for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I believe I can negotiate a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I will aim for a price closer to my desired range, but I'll be mindful of Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This price still offers you a significant value compared to what you'd gain elsewhere.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've raised the price to $1,100,000. This is still a substantial discount from my ideal price but demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while keeping the value proposition high for me. 
* **Message:** I've maintained a friendly tone, acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the need for a higher price. I've also stressed the benefits Bob would get from the deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Narrow the gap:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price range.
* **Keep the negotiations moving:** I want to find a solution that works for both of us and avoid a situation where I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered our previous negotiations, and I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price strikes a balance between the value I see in the product and a reasonable return for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I want to avoid the risk of losing a deal completely.  It's unlikely that I can get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a profit but also carries the risk that John might back out at a later stage. 

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a good deal and a guaranteed profit. It's a balance between getting the best possible price and managing the risk of a deal falling through."
