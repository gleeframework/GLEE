Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm willing to sell it for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high but reasonable:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) but well above my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation but aims to secure a good profit.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  The message is framed positively to encourage Bob's interest. His response will give me a better understanding of his willingness to pay. 
* **John as backup:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I know the product is worth more to him, so I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to walk away with $100 from John, so I have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but hold firm:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. However, I'm still significantly above his initial offer and aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""fair price"" and ""value of the product,"" I'm reminding Bob of its worth and subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher number. 
* **Alternative in mind:**  I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John for $100 if Bob remains unreasonable."
