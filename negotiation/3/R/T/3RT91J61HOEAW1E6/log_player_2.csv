Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate us trying to find middle ground here.  While I want to make this work, $1,000,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $1,300,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice is unlikely to come down much further and the difference between her final offer and John's price is small enough that it makes sense to go with the guaranteed price from John."
