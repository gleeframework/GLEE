"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I understand its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing a mutually agreeable price, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I value your business, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? ",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,125,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,175,000. It's a reasonable compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  How about $1,150,000 and we have a deal?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation. Let's be realistic. $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,162,500. This is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",1162500.0,Alice,7,
