"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's above your maximum budget and leaves no room for negotiation. It's better to reject and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly.  This price is below my maximum budget and leaves room for compromise.  Since Alice values the product at $12,000, there's potential for a deal to be made within our price ranges."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my desired price point. I believe I can still get a better deal with continued negotiation. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to stay within my budget.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I believe there's a good chance she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still above my maximum budget.  I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to go any lower. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me time."
