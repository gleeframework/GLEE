# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price just for you, Bob! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a good deal, but you can do better. You can buy the product from John for $120, which is your maximum price.  Therefore, you should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
