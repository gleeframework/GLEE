{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates that I am willing to negotiate, but I am also aware of the product's value to me.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will be prepared to counter his offer or move on to John if his offer isn't acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring further negotiation, as I might be able to reach a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $950,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I've already lowered my price twice, and it's clear that we are far apart in our valuations. To avoid further wasting time, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
