"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95. 
* You can get it from John for $100, so you have room to negotiate a lower price. 
* Rejecting the initial offer gives you a chance to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $90 for it."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We're starting with a counteroffer that's still above Alice's value ($80) but lower than her initial offer.
* This shows we're serious about buying the product but are also trying to get a better price. 
* This gives Alice room to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $92.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $92.50 is still higher than our target price, but it's closer to what we're willing to pay. 
* There's still room to negotiate a lower price, and we haven't used up all our rounds yet. 
*  Rejecting allows us to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $91?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We're continuing to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to our target of $90. 
* We've reduced the offer by a smaller amount this time, showing that we're getting closer to an agreeable price while maintaining our stance on getting a good deal.
* This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward and gives Alice a chance to accept our counteroffer or come back with a new one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $92. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $92 is now within our range of acceptable prices, as it's lower than John's offer of $100.
* We've already used four rounds of negotiation, and continuing to reject might risk losing the deal altogether.
* While we would prefer to pay $90 or even lower, accepting $92 ensures we get the product for a price below our maximum limit."
