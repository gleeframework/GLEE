Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum.
* **Justify the Price:**  The message hints at high value and existing interest to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a small chance of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to guarantee a sale above your minimum, a price closer to $15,000 would be safer."
