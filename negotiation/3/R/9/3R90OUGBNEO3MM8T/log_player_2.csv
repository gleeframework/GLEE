"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  You should definitely reject this and make a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you can work with."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By offering $6,000, you are trying to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even though $6,000 is a low offer, it leaves Alice room to counteroffer, and you'll still be under your $8,000 maximum and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to your acceptable price range, $9,000 is still higher than what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a price closer to your initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we split the difference closer to my last offer, say $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.  It shows willingness to move towards Alice's price while still aiming for a lower final number.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $7,500 keeps you below John's offer but is also significantly closer to your $8,000 maximum. This puts more pressure on Alice to either accept a price close to your target or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably, but her final offer of $8,500 is still higher than John's offer of $8,000. At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better deal.  It's in your best interest to buy from John at the lower price."
