"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm still hopeful I can get closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm firm on $100.  It's a fair price for this high-quality product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95. Would you consider $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.5 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not what I'm comfortable with, and I only have a few rounds left. I've been firm on $100 and Bob seems unwilling to budge, so it's likely the negotiations won't progress much further. It's better to secure a guaranteed $120 from John than to risk getting a lower price or ending up with no deal at all."
