"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item that's worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product for $10,000 from John. It makes sense to counteroffer or go straight to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, though.  How about $9,000?  That's the absolute most I can do."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $12,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. He should counteroffer again or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's final offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget and higher than what John is offering. Since he can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more sense to go with John's offer and avoid further negotiations with Alice."
