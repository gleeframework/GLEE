Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but doesn't give away too much profit.
* **It's lower than my minimum:** This provides me with a buffer to accept counteroffers without going below my minimum.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand the offer and respond accordingly.

By starting with this offer, I am setting the stage for a negotiation that has the potential to benefit both of us."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I need to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  How about $10,500? This still gives you a great price, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would prefer to get closer to $12,000, accepting this offer is a good compromise. This is a win for both of us as I get to sell my product, and Bob gets a great deal."
