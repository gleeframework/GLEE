Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $10,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob seems firmly rooted at $10,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable.  It's time to move on to John who's offering a price closer to my minimum."
