,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I do think the product is valuable, $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",100.0,Bob,4,
