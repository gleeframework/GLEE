Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still determined to get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about meeting halfway. But $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher offer. We're running out of time, so I need to be strategic about my next move.  I'll counteroffer one more time and see if we can close the deal."

We're down to the wire. Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and we only have two rounds left.  I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a good price, and it guarantees me a sale."
