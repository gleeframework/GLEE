"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $1,300,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your offer, the product's intrinsic worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects its true value and presents a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,500,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
