Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum desired value. There's no point in further negotiation as it's unlikely I'll get a higher price from Bob. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and efficient sale."
