{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and direct. I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective while still emphasizing the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting at a high price, knowing Bob is unlikely to accept it immediately.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $1,000,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), which gives me flexibility for counteroffers.
* **Time pressure:**  By mentioning John, I subtly introduce a sense of urgency.  Bob might feel pressured to make a deal before I sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am able to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my target. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room to improve the price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and see if he's willing to compromise further.
* **Risk of losing Bob:** There's a risk that Bob might walk away if I push too hard. However, I believe the potential for a higher price outweighs that risk at this stage.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. This will allow us to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a gradual approach. This counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not giving away too much.
* **Reasoning and Compromise:** I'm highlighting the reduction from my initial offer to emphasize that I'm trying to meet him halfway. This can make my counteroffer seem more reasonable. 
* **Remaining Firm:**  I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This ensures I'm not selling myself short.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** The ending question encourages Bob to respond and keep the negotiation going.

**Next Steps:**

Now it's up to Bob. If he accepts, I'll have a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value of the product to you. However, I would like to counter with an offer of $925,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my target.
* **Time pressure and John:**  While I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for now, the time pressure from John's offer is starting to weigh in.  I need to make sure I don't spend too long with Bob. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room to improve the price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and see if he's willing to compromise further.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. This will allow us to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'll need to keep John in mind and be ready to sell to him if negotiations with Bob don't yield a suitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I'm happy to keep negotiating, $925,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.  If not, I'll be reaching out to John to see if he's still interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Reasoning and Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that I've already made a significant compromise from my initial offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about John and the potential for the deal to fall through. 
* **Reiterating My Target:** $950,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's getting closer to what Bob is willing to pay.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, it's time to move on to John and secure a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $935,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $935,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Too Much Time Spent:**  We've been negotiating for a while now, and Bob's offers haven't moved significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is significantly more than what Bob is currently offering. 
* **Risk of Losing John:** If I keep negotiating with Bob, there's a chance John might get impatient and withdraw his offer.

**Decision:**

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. The risk of not getting a better deal with Bob is too high, especially considering the guaranteed profit from John's offer."
