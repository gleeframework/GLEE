"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. A counteroffer of $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer. Bob is trying to get the lowest possible price. Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again will allow Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000, but he needs to increase his offer slightly since Alice raised her price. $8,800 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it's tempting to accept and save some money compared to John's offer, Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate. Rejecting the offer again gives him more chances to reach a lower price. There are still 5 rounds left, and Bob might be able to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to increase her offer, but Bob needs to hold firm.  This counteroffer of $9,200 represents a significant discount from Alice's latest offer and is closer to Bob's target price range. While this might be rejected, it keeps the negotiation moving and puts pressure on Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is continuing to increase her price, but Bob is still committed to getting a better deal. Rejecting the offer and continuing to counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price. He has three rounds left, and while the risk of having to buy from John is increasing, Bob can still achieve a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. However, with only two rounds left, Bob needs to be more aggressive. This counteroffer represents a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer and giving her a price closer to what she might be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to secure a deal.  Alice continues to increase her price, and even if Bob were to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee she'll accept.  With only one round left, the risk of not getting a deal with Alice is too high. Buying from John at $12,000 guarantees Bob the product, although it's not the best price.  It's a strategic decision to ensure a purchase while minimizing potential loss."
