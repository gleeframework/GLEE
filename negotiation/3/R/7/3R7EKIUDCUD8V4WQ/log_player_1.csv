Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $100.
* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $120 (since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price). 

Offering the product at $119 gives Bob a chance to gain some value ($1 saving) while maximizing my potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
