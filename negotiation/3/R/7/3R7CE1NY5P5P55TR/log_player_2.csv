"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $17,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes Bob's intention to negotiate a lower price and signals that he's serious about making a deal. This also leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product well worth it. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer of $16,000 is still higher than his target. It's still worth exploring further negotiation to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $15,000, which is fair for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his target price of $15,000. This is a strong counteroffer that leaves no room for further negotiation, putting the pressure on Alice to accept or walk away."
