``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product well worth it. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $15,000, which is fair for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
