"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a relatively high starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. However, it's still below the maximum value I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a little more. I'll reject his offer and try to counter for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $165, which is higher than John's offer of $150.  While I'd prefer more, I'm getting closer to my desired price and we're nearing the end of the rounds. It's better to accept this offer than risk losing out on a deal altogether."
