Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it allows me to maximize my potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, I'm leaving room for negotiation.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Value to Me:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000, as this is the value I place on the product.
* **Potential Buyer John:** Having another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a fallback option. This means I don't have to accept any offers that are lower than this.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, I still want to try to get a better price. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price of $1,500,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,450,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  

My reasoning:

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above John:** My offer is still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, ensuring that I'm still getting a better deal than my fallback option.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly lower than my previous counteroffer of $1,450,000. This indicates that he's not willing to budge much further.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer, John, who will pay $1,000,000, it's no longer worth it to continue negotiating with Bob. It's better to secure the sale with John and guarantee a profit."
