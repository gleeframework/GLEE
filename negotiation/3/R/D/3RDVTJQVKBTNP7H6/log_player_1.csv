"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell it for $100, as it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get him to come up on his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is still higher than my minimum value but is a significant drop from my initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a reasonable price."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $160. I'm starting to get concerned that Bob isn't willing to pay what the product is worth to me. I need to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go lower than $150."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for $115. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I'm starting to feel like I may not be able to get a better offer from Bob, but I still have 4 rounds left before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $155. I'm getting closer to my minimum value, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price and agree to the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm running out of time. I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
