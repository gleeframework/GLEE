"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm starting the offer at $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Starting at $150 allows room for negotiation while ensuring I get at least $100 if Bob doesn't accept.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message establishes a good rapport with Bob, potentially making him more likely to negotiate.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Showing flexibility can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.**  However, I have 10 rounds, and there's potential for a better deal.
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers:**  This keeps the negotiation open, giving me the opportunity to increase the price. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price, but still higher than $100, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept,  I'm hoping to find a price that's fair for both of us.  Let's try $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a way to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  This helps to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for improvement:** While $110 is closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting gives me the opportunity to potentially increase the price further in the next round.
* **Risk assessment:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a chance on a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer with something slightly higher than $110, aiming to find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a compromise.  How about $115? It's a bit closer to your offer, and we're getting closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, but still less than my previous counteroffer.
* **Emphasis on progress:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a step towards a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and encouraging.

**Strategy:** By offering a slightly higher price, I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob while still getting a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:** Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending with John's offer of $100 is too high.
* **Securing a Profit:** Accepting this offer ensures I get a profit and avoid the risk of a lower price. 

While I'd ideally like to get a higher price, this offer is a reasonable compromise and guarantees a successful deal."
