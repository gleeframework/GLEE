"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which is still a great value for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer on price. How about $1,050,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to finding a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think we can do better. How about $980,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $980,000 just isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $1,015,000? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal!",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,015,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",990000.0,Bob,8,
