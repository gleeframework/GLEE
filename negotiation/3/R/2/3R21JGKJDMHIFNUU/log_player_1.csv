"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start high to anchor the negotiation in our favor. This leaves room for potential concessions while keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and potential ROI, we provide a reason for the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that this is an ""initial proposal,"" signaling our willingness to negotiate.

By starting high and confident, we aim to understand Bob's willingness to pay and set the stage for a profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly lower than our target and his perceived value.  We have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to $1,400,000. We are not in a desperate situation to accept a low offer since we have the backup option of John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a considerable offer, the product's inherent value and potential for you justify a higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and appreciate his engagement in the negotiation.
* **Value Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's value specifically to Bob, subtly reminding him of its worth beyond his initial offer.
* **Compromise:** By proposing $1,300,000, we signal flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong profit margin. 

This counteroffer demonstrates our commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement while holding firm on the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** While not ideal, $1,250,000 is still a significant profit above our minimum. Accepting secures a good deal. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob indicating this is his final offer suggests he's unlikely to move much higher.
* **Time Value & Risk:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us with John's lower offer. Accepting now guarantees a good return."
