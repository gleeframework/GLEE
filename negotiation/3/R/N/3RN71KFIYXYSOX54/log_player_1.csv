Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,250,000 is fair and reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so starting at $1,250,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit than selling to John.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your true bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and open to discussion. Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to counter-offer rather than simply saying ""yes"" or ""no.""

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room to negotiate down to a price that is still significantly higher than your guaranteed offer from John."
