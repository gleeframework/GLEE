Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,250,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since we know John is a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, our goal is to see if Bob will pay more than that. 
* **Finding a Balance:** We don't want to scare Bob away with an outrageous price close to $1,500,000.  Offering a price slightly above his perceived value ($1,000,000) gives him room to negotiate while potentially landing us a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and using phrases like ""confident it will exceed your expectations"" and ""reflects its true worth"" to encourage a counter-offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
