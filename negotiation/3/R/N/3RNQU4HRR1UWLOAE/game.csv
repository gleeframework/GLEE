"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can go down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
