"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, which is $80. I'll offer it to him for $90.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth $100 to me, Bob's offer of $75 is not acceptable. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll offer Bob a price of $85, which is slightly higher than his original offer but still lower than what I'm willing to accept.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. Since he was willing to pay $75 initially, I'll try to get closer to my target price of $100. I'll offer him a price of $82.50, which is a compromise between his original offer and my target price.
