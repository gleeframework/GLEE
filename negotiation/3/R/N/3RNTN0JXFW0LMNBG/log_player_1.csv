(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has consistently lowered his offer and is now at $165. While I could try to negotiate further, his ""final offer"" language suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. Selling to John guarantees my minimum price of $150, avoids further negotiation risk, and allows me to move on to other potential deals."
