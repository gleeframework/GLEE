Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price than it's worth to you, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but still leaves a substantial profit margin for Bob. 
* **The message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the potential benefits for both of us. This approach can encourage Bob to be more receptive to the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I will analyze Bob's response and decide whether to accept his counteroffer (if he makes one) or to make a new counteroffer. 
* **John's Option:** I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).**  However, I'm not desperate to sell and I believe there's room for negotiation. 
* **By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price.** I'll send a counteroffer closer to my original offer in the next round.
* **Selling to John right now would be leaving money on the table.**  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:**  This price is a compromise.  It's higher than Bob's last offer but lower than my original offer.  
* **The Message:** I'm staying positive and framing this as a way to find common ground.  I'm also emphasizing the benefits of finalizing the deal now.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and decide whether to accept his next offer (if he makes one), counteroffer again, or sell to John. 
* **John's Option:** I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
