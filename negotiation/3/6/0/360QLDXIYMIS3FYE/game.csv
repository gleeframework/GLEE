"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price than it's worth to you, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
