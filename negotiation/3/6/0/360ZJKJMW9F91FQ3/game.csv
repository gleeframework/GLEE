"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but your offer is significantly below its true value.  This product is incredibly valuable, and I need to get closer to $2,000,000 for it. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $1,250,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to move down to $1,700,000 if it closes the deal today. What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
