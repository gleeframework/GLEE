**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark that John is readily offering.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower offer isn't worth it. It's time to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
