"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is quite significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair reflection of its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it, and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
