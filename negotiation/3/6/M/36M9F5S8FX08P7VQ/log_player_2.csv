# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget. It's best to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, your price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you.  I hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. You should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  There's still time to reach a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high.  You should continue to negotiate. You have a few rounds left before you need to consider John's offer, so there's still time to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up slightly to $950,000.  I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. Let's keep working towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1075000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 7. There are only three rounds left. At this point, Alice is still unwilling to come down to a price that's within your budget. While there is a chance you might be able to negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds, it's unlikely you'll be able to get it down to your maximum budget. Buying from John for $800,000 is the safer option to ensure you get the product without exceeding your budget."
