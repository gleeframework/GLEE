"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, your price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you.  I hope we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to go up slightly to $950000.  I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. Let's keep working towards a deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
