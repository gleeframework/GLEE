"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a good starting point, as it's a fairly aggressive price but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't interested.  I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and make the negotiation less adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $110 is low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $117? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $117 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to negotiate further. $117 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $120? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
