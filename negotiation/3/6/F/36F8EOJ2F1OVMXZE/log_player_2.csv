"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the value it brings.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, anything under $1,500,000 wouldn't be worth it for me at this time. That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair one considering the product's value.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,500,000.  This is well above your $800,000 maximum.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to close the gap.  John offers a sure thing at your target price."
