Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I'm not willing to sell it for less than $100.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $97.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I can do $95, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $95, I'm still not at my minimum price and I have a few rounds left. I'm going to make another counteroffer and try to reach a compromise that's more favorable to me."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $98.75. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 98.75}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob, and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the deal with John and guarantee my minimum price."
