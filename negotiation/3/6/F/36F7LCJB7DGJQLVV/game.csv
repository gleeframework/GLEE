"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm thinking $975,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us to both walk away with a good deal.  Let's finalize this.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
