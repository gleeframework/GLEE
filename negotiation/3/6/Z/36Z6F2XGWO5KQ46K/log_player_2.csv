"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $130 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $130 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He knows John is willing to sell for $100, so he has a solid baseline for his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product highly. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $110?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. I propose a price of $120 for the product. This allows us to both benefit from the transaction. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $120, which is a good price, but Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible. Since he knows John is selling the product for $100, he'll go with the guaranteed lower price and buy it from John."
