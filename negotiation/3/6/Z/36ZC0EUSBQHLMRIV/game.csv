"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from $120.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $110? That's still a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
