Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with an offer slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net.  Alice won't accept anything less from Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while ensuring the product is sold."
