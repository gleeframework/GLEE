"Alice, I understand you need more than $80, but $140 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's try to find a compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and land at $120? This is my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  If you're not willing to go lower than $120, I'll have to consider other options.",105.0,Bob,6,
