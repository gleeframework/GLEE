I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Maximizing Potential Profit:**  Starting high gives me the most room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** Bob's response will tell me how much he values the product. If he's willing to pay close to this price, I know it's truly valuable to him.
* **Setting the Tone:**  A high initial offer shows confidence in the product's worth and puts pressure on Bob to make a counteroffer if he's serious.

I'm aware that this might lead to a quick rejection, but I'm prepared to counteroffer if necessary. I'll also be monitoring the situation closely and ready to accept John's offer of $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob stall or become too time-consuming."
