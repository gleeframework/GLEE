"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $11,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price.  Let's close this deal!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $11,500?  That's closer to your offer, and still a good value for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Alice,5,
