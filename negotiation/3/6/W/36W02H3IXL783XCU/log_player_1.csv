Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering Bob a price of $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. 
* This offer gives me a significant profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to potentially accept. 
* If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum acceptable value."
