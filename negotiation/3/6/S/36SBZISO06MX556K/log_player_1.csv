Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting the value to Bob emphasizes the potential benefit of the deal for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Plan B:** I have the option of selling to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer of $9,000 still yields a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **Time and Risk:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob backing out entirely or lowering his offer further, potentially leading to a lower profit or even no sale. 
* **Reasonable Counter:** Bob's counteroffer is reasonable, showing a willingness to compromise. Accepting it minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ensures a solid profit."
