{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:**  It's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal.
* **It's a clear opening:**  It establishes my willingness to negotiate and gives Bob a starting point for his response.
* **It's open-ended:** It encourages Bob to respond, either with acceptance or a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer you $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than $8,000 from John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I want to see if I can push Bob to come closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little low for me. How about $9,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
