Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to $120 as possible, but still give Bob a reason to choose your offer over waiting. 
* **Slight Incentive:** Offering the product at $119 gives Bob a small discount, making it more appealing than if he waits for you to sell it to John.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" adds a bit of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 
 
This strategy aims to balance maximizing your profit while increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
