"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to buy your product for $1450000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1450000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1600000?  This would be a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1550000?  This is a fair price that leaves room for both of us to be happy.  Let's finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
