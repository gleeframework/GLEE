Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle above your minimum price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 provides leverage. You don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
