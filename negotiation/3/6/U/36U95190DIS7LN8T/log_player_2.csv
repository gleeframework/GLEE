{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move, and I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. It's unlikely she'll accept this offer right away, but it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $175 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to drive the price down further. There are still plenty of rounds left to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still pushing for a price that works for me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will start to bridge the gap between our offers and lead to a deal in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $160 is still beyond my acceptable range. I'm sticking to my strategy of negotiating and pushing for a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm taking a more significant step towards Alice's offer this round. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price below $100, which is my maximum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be close enough for Alice to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
