"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own value of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows for a potential counteroffer that could save Bob money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my current budget.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:** $1,025,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 and is within Bob's budget.
* **Continuing negotiations might lead to a stalemate:**  Alice has clearly indicated a limit with her offer, and further counteroffers might risk her walking away from the deal altogether.
* **John's price is significantly higher:**  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is far less desirable than accepting Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $1,025,000 is the most logical choice for Bob. It secures the product at a reasonable price while avoiding potential delays and the risk of a higher price from John."
