Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. This is a great deal for both of us, as you get a fantastic product at a lower price, and I get a fair deal for my time and effort. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130** is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum price of $150, but still above Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring you're not giving away too much.
* **The message** emphasizes the win-win aspect of the deal, making Bob more likely to consider your offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. Depending on Bob's response, you may need to adjust your strategy and counteroffers. Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while still keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for you. 

Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value.  You can use this opportunity to negotiate further and potentially reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price that allows me to recover some of my costs while also giving you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $120 represents a compromise, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes the ""middle ground"" aspect of the offer, making it sound more appealing to Bob. It also reinforces your desire to reach an agreement.

This counteroffer is designed to test Bob's commitment while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is unlikely to meet your expectations. 

Selling to John for $150 guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiations that may not yield a better outcome. It's a safer and more profitable option at this point."
