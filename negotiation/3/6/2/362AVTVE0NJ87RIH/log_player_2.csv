"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $90 is still a bit high for him. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay. He's still within his budget to keep negotiating, aiming for a price closer to his $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $87.50 - that's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $87.50, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $90, and we can call it a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.**  This is the same as her initial offer, but it's still better than John's offer of $100.
* **We're already in Round 5, and time is running out.** Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **The difference between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price is small.**  It's worth accepting a slightly higher price to secure the product and avoid the risk of losing it."
