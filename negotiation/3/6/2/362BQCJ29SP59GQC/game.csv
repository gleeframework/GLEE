"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $825,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. That's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $800,000, Bob. However, I've already had another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay the full $800,000. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $820,000. This is my final offer above $800,000.",820000.0,Alice,5,
