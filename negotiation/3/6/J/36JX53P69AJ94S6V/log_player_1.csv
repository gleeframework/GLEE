Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.  If he rejects, I can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counter-offer, or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a bit closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  If he rejects again, I might be more open to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. Selling to John would give me my minimum, but Bob's offer is closer to my desired price."
