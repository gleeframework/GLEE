**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal.  I'm offering $900,000, which is still a decent profit for Alice and within my budget.  I'm hoping this will prompt a more reasonable response from her."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $50,000 over my ideal price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget.  $950,000 is a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping this will convince Alice to accept."
