Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 simply doesn't work for me. It's clear we both value this product highly, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but  $900,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer.
