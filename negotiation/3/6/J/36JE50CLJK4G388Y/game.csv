"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue negotiating with you.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as high as I can go.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. However, $850,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I truly believe this product will be extremely valuable to you, and this price reflects its potential.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think about buying from John at $800,000, so I hope we can meet in the middle soon.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 simply doesn't work for me. It's clear we both value this product highly, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but  $900,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer.  I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit of investing in it. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to protect your investment, but I'm not willing to go above $825,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet at $825,000 or is that still not possible?",825000.0,Bob,8,
