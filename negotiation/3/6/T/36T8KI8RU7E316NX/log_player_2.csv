"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $900,000 saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While the product is worth less to Alice ($800,000), your goal is to save money, not necessarily get the best possible deal.  You're still getting the product for less than your maximum budget."
