**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently unwilling to meet even halfway between his valuation ($800,000) and Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). His increments are getting smaller, indicating he may not budge much higher. It's unlikely he'll reach a price acceptable to Alice within the remaining rounds.  

Therefore, it's in Alice's best interest to cut her losses and sell to John, securing the guaranteed $1,200,000."
