Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me in the middle at $90?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

While it would be ideal to earn more, Bob has made it clear this is his final offer. Accepting the $80 meets your minimum selling price and avoids the risk of him walking away in future rounds."
