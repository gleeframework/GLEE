"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a counteroffer of $1390000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1390000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1390000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1320000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1320000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a counteroffer of $1360000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1360000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1360000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer of $1280000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might need to consider buying from John if we can't come to an agreement.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
