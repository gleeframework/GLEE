"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe it will bring significant value to your business. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still higher than you're willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. Considering the value you've placed on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than your preferred price. You can try to push for a lower price by making another counteroffer. There's still a chance you can negotiate a price closer to your desired $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is closer to your desired price but still above your comfort zone. While you could continue negotiating, there's a chance the price won't drop significantly further. You've already had multiple rounds of counteroffers, and it's unlikely Alice will drop her price drastically at this point. 

It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $1,000,000, securing the product at your maximum price and avoiding potential further negotiation rounds."
