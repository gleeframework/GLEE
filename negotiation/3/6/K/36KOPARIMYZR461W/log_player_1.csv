I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from John's offer, but I believe there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay it. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:** I want to try and get the highest possible price for the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, if he accepts, I earn a much larger profit.
* **Unknown Value:** I have no information about the value of the product to Bob.  Therefore, a higher offer might be more likely to appeal to him.

This strategy balances my need to earn a good profit with the potential to miss out on a sale entirely."
