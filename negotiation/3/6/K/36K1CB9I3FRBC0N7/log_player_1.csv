Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is quite a bit below its true value. To move this forward, I could consider $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $750,000 is significantly less than what it's worth to me.  I can come down to $900,000, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer $800,000. This is my final offer.  It reflects a fair price considering John is also offering the same deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met his maximum valuation of the product.  While selling to John would yield a higher profit, there's no guarantee Bob will go any higher in subsequent rounds. Accepting the $800,000 ensures a good deal without risking a worse outcome if negotiations continue."
