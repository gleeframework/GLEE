"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,350,000? This would allow me to make a fair deal without straining my finances.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,375,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,360,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1360000.0,Bob,4,
