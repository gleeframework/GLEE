"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still beyond my budget.  Could we agree on $12,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can settle on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept anything below $16,000. This offer reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $16,000 is still a stretch for me. I can offer you $13,000. This is my final offer; I'm hoping you'll consider it seriously. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated this is his final offer. While he might budge a little, it's unlikely he'll meet the $15,000 threshold that represents my absolute minimum (and what John is offering).  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
