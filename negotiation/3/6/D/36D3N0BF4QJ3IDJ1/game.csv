"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still beyond my budget.  Could we agree on $12,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can settle on this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept anything below $16,000. This offer reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $16,000 is still a stretch for me. I can offer you $13,000. This is my final offer; I'm hoping you'll consider it seriously.",13000.0,Bob,6,
