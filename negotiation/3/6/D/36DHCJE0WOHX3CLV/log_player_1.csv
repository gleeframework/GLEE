Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($100) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than $80, but she can aim higher with Bob."
