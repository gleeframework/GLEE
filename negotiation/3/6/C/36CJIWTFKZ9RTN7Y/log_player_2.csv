Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $950,000 for the product.

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $950,000.  Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, it's in your best interest to cut your losses with Alice and go with the guaranteed lower price."
