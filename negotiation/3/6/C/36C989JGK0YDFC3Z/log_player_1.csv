"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to my desired outcome, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. This subtly reminds him of the potential benefit he'll gain from buying it. 
* **Open to discussion:** My message isn't aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to push the price higher.
* **Exploring options:** While selling to John is always an option, it's not the most profitable choice. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price, but still maintaining a margin above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly encouraging him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive tone:** My message remains polite and open to further negotiation, keeping the conversation constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. I believe we can find common ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited rounds:** We are nearing the midpoint of the negotiation rounds, leaving less opportunity for further bargaining.
* **Opportunity cost:** While I would prefer a higher price, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a stalemate outweighs the potential benefit of a few more rounds.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and secures the sale."
