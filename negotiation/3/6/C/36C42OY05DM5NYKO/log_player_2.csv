Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this is the best price I can offer. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at this price. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000."
