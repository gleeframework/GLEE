Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $100. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $100 is a 25% markup from your minimum, which might be enticing for Bob if the product is valuable to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting higher gives you some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or how badly he wants the product. If you had more information, you could potentially adjust your offer for a better outcome."
