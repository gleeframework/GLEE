Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might find acceptable, considering the product's worth to him. This gives us room to negotiate while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  Even though selling to John is a safe option, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again, but still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to justify risking further negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so I'll take that option."
