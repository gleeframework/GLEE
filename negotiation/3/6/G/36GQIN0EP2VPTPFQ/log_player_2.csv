# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and benefits, I estimate its true worth to be $12,000. However, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $11,000. This exclusive opportunity is designed to ensure you receive the best value while also securing a beneficial deal for us. Please let me know if this offer aligns with your needs and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** Even though it's a discount, it's still more than you're willing to spend. 
* **John's offer is your fallback option.** You're willing to pay $12,000 from John, so you're not in a desperate rush to accept anything less. 
* **You have time to negotiate further.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially prompt her to lower her price or you can move on to other sellers."
