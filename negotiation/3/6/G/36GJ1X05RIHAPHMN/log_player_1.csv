{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, it's getting close to the end of our negotiations.  I'm concerned that if I continue to negotiate with Bob, I might lose the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price.  It's best to secure the deal with John now and ensure I get my desired price."
