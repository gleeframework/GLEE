"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,450,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,350,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's slightly above what I'm comfortable spending. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,375,000. I hope this proposal helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows me to meet my own financial goals. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
