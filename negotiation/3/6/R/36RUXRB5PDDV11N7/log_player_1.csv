""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Knowing Your Worth:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to both you and Bob. This means there's a potential profit margin to be made.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob declines. 

By offering the product at $20,000, you're aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for it. If he negotiates, you can always come down in price, but you've set a strong initial point."
