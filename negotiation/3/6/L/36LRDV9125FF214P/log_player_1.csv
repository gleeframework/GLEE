Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000? That's a significant saving for both of us, and it's a price I'm confident I can justify.
