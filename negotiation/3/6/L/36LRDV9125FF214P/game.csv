"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000? That's a significant saving for both of us, and it's a price I'm confident I can justify.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,150,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to make this work. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a slightly lower price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm going to offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I've already compromised on. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping you'll accept it. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
