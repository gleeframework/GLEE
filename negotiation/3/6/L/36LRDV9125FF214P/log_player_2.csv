"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Since it's worth $1,500,000 to you, you can aim to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, there's still room for further negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  The goal is to reach a price as close to $1,000,000 as possible before considering buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a slightly lower price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm going to offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I've already compromised on. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping you'll accept it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $1,100,000.  At this point, it's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer saves you $375,000 compared to buying from John and is a good compromise."
