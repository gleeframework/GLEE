I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us both walk away happy.",10000.0,Bob,4,

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
