"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1300000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1325000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1325000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1330000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1330000.0,Alice,5,
