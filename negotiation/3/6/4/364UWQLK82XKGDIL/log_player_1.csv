I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$100 is far too low for me.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum.  Hopefully, this is a good compromise that Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not going to risk losing this sale by rejecting his offer and potentially getting a lower counteroffer."
