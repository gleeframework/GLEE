"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far too high, and he can get the product for much less from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a better price is possible."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He should reject this offer and try to negotiate further.  He has a strong bargaining position because he can always walk away and buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I still need to make a decent profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has already made a counteroffer of $9,500 and Alice has rejected it.  While $11,000 is a lower price than previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000.  He saves money and avoids further negotiation."
