Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get at least $119. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
