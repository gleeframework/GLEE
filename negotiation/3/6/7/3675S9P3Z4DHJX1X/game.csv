"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us.  Let's make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
