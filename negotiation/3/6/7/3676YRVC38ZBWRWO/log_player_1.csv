"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation but also shows I'm serious about a good price.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I highlight the ""great deal"" aspect, emphasizing the benefit for him.
* **Open ended:** I don't force a quick decision but leave the door open for discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.**  While it's closer, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000 just yet.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is a secure option, I want to maximize my potential profit by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

I'll proceed to round 3 and send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This still gives you a significant savings, and it's fair for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing benefits:** I highlight that this price still gives Bob a ""significant savings"" compared to his initial value of $1,200,000.
* **Positive framing:** I use language like ""fair for both of us"" to create a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Direct question:** I end with a direct question to encourage Bob to respond quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $960,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** While Bob is getting closer to my price, I believe we can still get a better deal with further negotiation. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  I'm still hesitant to sell to John for $1,200,000 because I think I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  

I'll proceed to round 5 and send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little hesitant at $960,000. How about we split the difference at $965,000? This is a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I use phrases like ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Moving toward a deal:** I explicitly state that this offer brings us ""closer to a deal,"" creating a sense of urgency and momentum.
* **Direct question:** I end with a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can get even closer to my budget. How about $962,500 for the product?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $962,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  
* **Closing the gap:** While he's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum just yet.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room for improvement and I can likely get a better offer with further negotiation.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm determined to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

I will proceed to round 7 and send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm eager to find a solution.  Let's try $964,000.  This is only a small difference from your last offer, and it puts us very close to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 964000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small difference:** I'm offering a price just $1,500 higher than Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm very close to accepting his terms.
* **Emphasis on closeness:** I use phrases like ""small difference"" and ""very close to a deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to close the gap.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize that this offer is ""a solution"" and that it puts us ""very close to a deal,"" focusing on the positive aspects of the situation.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to propose $963,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $963,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $963,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $963,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. However, it's still significantly lower, and with only two rounds left, I'm concerned I won't be able to get a much better offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a high risk that Bob will continue to haggle, potentially driving the price down further. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 

While I'd prefer to reach a deal with Bob, the potential for further negotiation and a lower price outweighs the risk of missing out on a guaranteed profit.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
