You're trying to save money, and Alice's offer is too high. It makes sense to try and negotiate with her."

I'm offering Alice $750,000, which is a significant discount from her initial offer. This gives her some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially save a considerable amount."

I'm going to offer Alice $800,000, which is my maximum price.  This is the same price I can get from John, so I'm not willing to go any higher."
