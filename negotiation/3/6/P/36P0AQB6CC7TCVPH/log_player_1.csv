Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $100, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have John as a backup who will buy it at my minimum price, so I'm not desperate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's interested, while still securing a good profit if he accepts outright."
