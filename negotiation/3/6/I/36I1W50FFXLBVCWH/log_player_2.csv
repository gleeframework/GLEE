"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to own a valuable item worth more than its face value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $95. You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for $80.  There's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $95 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $90. Let's see if we can find a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50 for our premium product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for $80. You can try to squeeze out a little more before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $91? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to sell it to you for $91.50. This is a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is only $1.50 more than your counteroffer.  It's not worth risking getting a worse deal from John for the sake of saving another $0.50."
