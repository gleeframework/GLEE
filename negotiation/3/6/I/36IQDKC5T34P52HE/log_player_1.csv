Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also significantly less than your minimum price, giving you the opportunity to either negotiate down to a more favorable price, or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees I reach my minimum goal, and I can always try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the future if John isn't interested in the product."
