Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate. It's also important to start high to see how much Bob is willing to pay."

Bob's offer of $862,500 is very close to my desired price.  I don't want to risk him walking away, and I'm not sure I can get a better price with only four rounds left.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
