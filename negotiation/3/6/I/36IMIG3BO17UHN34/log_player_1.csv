"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can start negotiating down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,500, which is a little closer to Bob's value and a little higher than my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value, and I'm happy to close the deal at this price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount, and I still have time to negotiate with Bob in future rounds if necessary."
