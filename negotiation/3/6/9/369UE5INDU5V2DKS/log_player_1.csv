Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows its worth much more to her. Starting high leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value.
* **Below John's offer:**  Alice is willing to accept slightly less than John's offer to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the deal. This ensures she still gets a significant profit.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message highlights the ""unique value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's desire for a good investment."
