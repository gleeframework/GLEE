"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",8000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $5000 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $5000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've learned about your interest so far.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $6500 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, $6500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. My next counteroffer is $8500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and what I've learned about your interest so far.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. However, $7200 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. My next counteroffer is $8000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",8000.0,Alice,7,
