"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,250,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
