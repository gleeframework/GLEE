"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth more to Alice than to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,250,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than your maximum limit.  It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to $1,000,000."
