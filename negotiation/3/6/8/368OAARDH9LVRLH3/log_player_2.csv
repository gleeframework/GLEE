# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $950,000 is less than $1,000,000. 
* **You save money by accepting Alice's offer:**  You can save $50,000 by going with Alice. 

Even though the product is worth more to you ($1,000,000) than it is to Alice ($800,000), it's still in your best interest to accept the offer since you can get it for a lower price than John's."
