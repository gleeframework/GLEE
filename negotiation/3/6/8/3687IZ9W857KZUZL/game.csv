"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which I think is fair considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130. Let's finalize this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
