"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for much less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but he shouldn't be afraid to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is far too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential savings for you compared to selling to John."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still represents a significant savings for you compared to your alternative options. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant drop from her initial offer, it's still over Bob's target price of $800,000.  He can still get a better deal with John, or try to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $1,100,000 is not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This price is fair considering the value you'll be getting and the limited time we have to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,200,000 is closer to his target, he's still better off going with John, especially since they are on a tight timeline.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further, but he shouldn't hesitate to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,150,000. This price reflects a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's close this deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting, and it gives us both a chance to finalize this deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's only got a few rounds left, and while Alice has come down in price, it's still too high for Bob.  He's better off closing the deal with John and getting the product for his target price, even if it means ending the negotiation with Alice."
