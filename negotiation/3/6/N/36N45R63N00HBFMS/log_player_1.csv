Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing your profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
