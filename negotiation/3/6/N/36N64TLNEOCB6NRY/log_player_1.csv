{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value and gives you a good opportunity for profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target:** I'm aiming for a price closer to the midpoint of our valuations ($1,150,000) to start. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the potential for Bob to make a profit by highlighting the value of the product to him.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for negotiation while still starting strong.

**Note:** This is just the initial offer.  I'll be prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, and I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer that respects the value of the product while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.** I won't accept an offer that doesn't at least cover my minimum value.
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  While John is a safe option, Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **A counteroffer gives me leverage.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This still allows you a good margin for profit, and it's a price I can accept. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counter-proposal that's closer to his initial offer but still above my minimum.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential profit he can make at this price, appealing to his financial interest.
* **Flexibility:** I'm still open to negotiation and want to keep the conversation going to explore a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I would like to counter with a price of $1,000,000. I hope this helps move us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now at $1,000,000**, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **There's a significant chance Bob will not increase his offer further.** He's already moved up from his initial offer, and there's a risk he'll walk away if I reject him again.
* **Selling to John is a safe option but a lower profit.** While selling to John guarantees $800,000,  accepting Bob's offer secures a higher price.

**Conclusion:** 
Given the potential for a better deal with Bob and the risk of losing him entirely, it's strategically advantageous to accept Bob's offer at $1,000,000."
