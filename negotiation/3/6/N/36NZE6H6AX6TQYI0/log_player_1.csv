Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Bob ($75,000) while securing you a profit significantly higher than your minimum.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and offering Bob a price that is enticing enough for him to accept."
