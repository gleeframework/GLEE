"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a great fit for your needs.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still too high. There's room for negotiation, and you want to try and save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a certain budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This still allows you a substantial profit margin.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $900,000 is still higher than what you want to pay. You're confident you can get a better price, and you're not ready to buy from John yet. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Let's meet at $890,000. This price reflects both the value of the product and your budget constraints.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $890,000 is within your budget. While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and the possibility of having to buy from John for a higher price make accepting this offer the best option at this point. You've secured a good deal while saving a considerable amount of money."
