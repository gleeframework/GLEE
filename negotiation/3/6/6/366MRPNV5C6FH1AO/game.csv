"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I know this is a bit higher than what it's worth to you, but it's a valuable piece for me. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a deal that works for you, but $900,000 simply doesn't meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see at least $1,200,000 to make this work for me. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a significant amount and shows my commitment to this deal.  I hope we can come to an agreement soon.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm seeing that we're getting closer.  However, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1,100,000.  This gives you a good deal while ensuring I can still get a fair price. Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal and save ourselves more negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to raise your offer. However, $950,000 still falls short of my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offers and ensures we both achieve a satisfactory outcome. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal. While $1,050,000 is closer to my range, I'm still only able to go up to $975,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good compromise.  Let's aim to close this deal and move forward.",975000.0,Bob,8,
