"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to see a higher offer from him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a deal that works for you, but $900,000 simply doesn't meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see at least $1,200,000 to make this work for me. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a significant amount and shows my commitment to this deal.  I hope we can come to an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal of $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm seeing that we're getting closer.  However, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal and save ourselves more negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price,  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below what I need.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to raise your offer. However, $950,000 still falls short of my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offers and ensures we both achieve a satisfactory outcome. Let's work towards a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal. While $1,050,000 is closer to my range, I'm still only able to go up to $975,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good compromise.  Let's aim to close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting very close to my minimum, but still not high enough to meet my goal of earning as much as possible.  Given that I only have two rounds left, I don't have time to negotiate further and risk Bob rejecting my final offer. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get the best possible price."
