Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but it's also higher than my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good price without having to go through a long negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. However, I can sell the product to John for the same amount, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob. So, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $150."
