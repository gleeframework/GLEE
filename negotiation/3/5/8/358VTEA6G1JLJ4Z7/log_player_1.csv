``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation of $1,200,000, but lower than my minimum of $1,500,000.  This allows for some room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario. If Bob rejects, I can always go back to John, who is willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round.  While I could sell to John now, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but if the negotiations continue to stall, I'll sell to John."
