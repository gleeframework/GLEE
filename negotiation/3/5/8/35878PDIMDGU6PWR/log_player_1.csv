{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth much more to you than that.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount for Bob:**  He can still make a good profit, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too low for me:**  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, giving me some breathing room if Bob counters.
* **It sets the tone for a positive negotiation:** I'm being reasonable, but still aiming for a profitable deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay that price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's still a profit for me, I'm not willing to settle for that amount. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since the product is worth so much more to him.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is still a decent profit for me, while still being a good deal for Bob. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away the farm. It sets the stage for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. While it's not the highest price I hoped for, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Bob is clearly motivated to buy the product, and I'm confident that I can't get a much better offer from him.  It's time to close the deal."
