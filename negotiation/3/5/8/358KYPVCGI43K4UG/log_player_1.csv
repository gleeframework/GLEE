{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's estimated value, but below my minimum acceptable price.  It leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer, but still puts me in a strong position. I'm willing to negotiate further, but if he rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $9,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $9,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell for less. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but I'm getting closer to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $9,000. It's a fair price for a product you clearly value, and it's the lowest I can go.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,000, so I'll offer $8,500 again. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made several concessions and it seems like he's not willing to budge.  Rather than continuing this negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for my minimum price of $10,000. This ensures I get the value I want for the product."
