"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to try and entice Bob to see it as a good investment.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation process.

This strategy is a good starting point. However, it's important to monitor Bob's reactions and adjust my offers accordingly throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm not willing to sell the product for anything less than $1,500,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Even though Bob offered my minimum, I can likely get a higher price by counteroffering. 
* **Selling to John isn't the best option yet.**  While I'm guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, I have the potential to earn more through continued negotiation with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly above $1,500,000, hoping to find a compromise that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer. However, I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,750,000? This price still reflects the true value of the product, but also shows my willingness to compromise."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to remind Bob that this price is still fair considering its potential.
* **Maintain a Margin:** Even at $1,750,000, I'm still earning above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a successful transaction.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still giving me a decent profit margin. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1500000. How about we try $1600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is only $100,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject his offer, there's a risk that he will lower his offer further or even walk away. 
* **Time is running out:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to consider the possibility of not reaching a deal with Bob. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a decent profit with minimal risk.  It's a smart decision to secure the sale, especially since John is also offering my minimum price."
