"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,100,000 is less than what John is selling it for, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,050,000 is a better price than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation."
