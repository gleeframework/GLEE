Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,500. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $500 just yet. How about we meet at $16,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Bob should buy the product from John. At this point, Alice has shown that she's not willing to budge much further on price, and Bob can get the product for his desired $15,000 from John.  There's no need to continue the negotiation with Alice, as the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
