"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price closer to my valuation. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $750,000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart. I understand you have a budget, and I want to make this work. How about we meet at $850,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with a price higher than John's offer."
