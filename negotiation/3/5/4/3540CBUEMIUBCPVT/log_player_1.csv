Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This initial offer is high, reflecting my valuation of the product. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation.  I'm also prepared to walk away if he's not willing to come close to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but his offer is too far off.  I'll counter with a price closer to my valuation, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price closer to my valuation. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my valuation. I'm not yet ready to sell at that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my valuation, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $750,000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart. I understand you have a budget, and I want to make this work. How about we meet at $850,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
