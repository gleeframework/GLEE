"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12500 is a significant compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $13000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $13000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, and I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
