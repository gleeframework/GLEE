"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this price is still attractive to Bob if the product is truly valuable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $800,000 is too low, especially considering I'm already willing to sell to John for $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold and below what I could get from John. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal while also remaining firm on my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Although it's getting closer, it's still below the $1,000,000 I could get from John. With a few rounds left, there's still potential for a better deal with Bob, and I want to explore that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise and getting closer to Bob's offer. However, it's still above the minimum threshold I'm willing to accept, and with limited rounds left, I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob's offer still below my minimum acceptable value, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I would have preferred to get a better price, it's important to secure a sale and not risk losing out completely."
