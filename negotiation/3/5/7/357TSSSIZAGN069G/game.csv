"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's worth to me is much lower than its worth to you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,500. How about we meet at $8,800? This is a more reasonable price for me, and I'm confident I can make it work.",8800.0,Bob,4,
