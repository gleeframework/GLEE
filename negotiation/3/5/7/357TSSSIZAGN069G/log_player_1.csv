Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's worth to me is much lower than its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,500. How about we meet at $8,800? This is a more reasonable price for me, and I'm confident I can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer.  $8,800 is still a decent profit for me, so I'll accept."
