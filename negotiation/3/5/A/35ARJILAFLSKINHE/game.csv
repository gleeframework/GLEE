"Alice,  $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95.  If you're willing to come down a little, we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we settle on $105? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to that.",105.0,Alice,5,
