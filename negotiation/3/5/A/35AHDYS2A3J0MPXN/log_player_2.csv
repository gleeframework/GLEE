"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price before resorting to the alternative.  Since the product is worth $80 to you, you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $55. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a price that's fair to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

Alice came down to $70, so I'm going to meet her halfway with a counteroffer of $60.  This is still a good deal for me, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer and try one more counteroffer. I'm hoping to get a lower price, but I'm also aware that I might need to buy from John if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $65. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.  It's a good price for me and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now offering the product at the same price John is selling it. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as I can get the product at the same price from John."
