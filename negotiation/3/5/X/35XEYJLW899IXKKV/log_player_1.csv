{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant amount above my minimum of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more, but I'm prepared to negotiate down to around $12,000 if necessary. If Bob rejects my offer and counters too low, I can always go to John and get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my desired price range. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,500? I'm confident this price still provides you with a great deal, and it's more in line with the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price than Bob's initial offer, and it's still a profitable sale for me.  I'd rather take this deal than risk losing a sale and having to settle with John for a lower price."
