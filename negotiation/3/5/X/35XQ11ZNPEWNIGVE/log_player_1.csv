"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, so I'm open to counteroffers.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message focuses on the value of the product for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** While it's closer than his initial perceived value, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. 
* **I have more rounds to negotiate.**  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John is a backup option.**  If the negotiation doesn't go well, I can always sell to John and guarantee my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000,  which I believe is a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm not going all the way down to Bob's price, leaving space for another counteroffer.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and highlighting the fairness of my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it offers, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price.**  This is the best I can get without risking a loss.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  I've reached my target price, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round.
* **Selling to John is redundant:**  John offers the same price as Bob's current offer, so there's no advantage to switching buyers."
