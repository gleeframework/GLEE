I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make a deal at $150?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  How about $110? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $110. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $140 for it. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
