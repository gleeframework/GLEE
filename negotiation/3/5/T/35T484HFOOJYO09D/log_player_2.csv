{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105. If that doesn't work for you, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the price at $108 for the product?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, $108 is still more than you're willing to pay.  It's worth seeing if you can get her down to $105 before giving up and buying from John. You're only two rounds away from being able to buy from John, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the compromise.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget.  I'm going to stick with $105, but I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to come down to that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our ongoing discussion, I propose we finalize the deal at $107 for the product. This price is slightly above your last offer, reflecting the product's value and ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I hope this proposal works for you, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $107 is still more than you're willing to pay, and you're down to your last three rounds. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $100. It's a guaranteed lower price, and you only have three rounds left before you're forced to buy at whatever price Alice proposes."
