Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a more reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $1,000,000?  That feels like a fair offer to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unwilling to budge beyond his valuation and is unlikely to go substantially higher. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
