"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $110. What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. How about $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
