"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than my ideal price and even my fallback option.  I need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This offer is closer to my target price and leaves room for negotiation. By stating my interest and being polite, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still significantly higher than my fallback option with John. I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is closer, my budget is quite a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer is roughly halfway between Alice's latest offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($6,000).  It shows a willingness to compromise but also sets a firm boundary.
* **Staying Above John:** I'm intentionally staying above my fallback option of $8,000 with John. This leaves me some wiggle room to negotiate further if Alice rejects this offer. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** Continuing to be appreciative and respectful helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly and is now only offering the product for $250 more than John's price. It's unlikely that she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose out on the deal altogether. Accepting this offer represents a good balance between getting a decent price and securing the product."
