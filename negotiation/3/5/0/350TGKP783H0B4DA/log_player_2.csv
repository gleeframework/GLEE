"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well above my minimum price and significantly less than what you'd be willing to pay.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is less than your maximum budget of $120. Even though she's using some sales tactics by mentioning your potential higher valuation, it's still a good deal. Accepting this offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
