"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for it. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as I'm sure you can find another buyer at that price. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
