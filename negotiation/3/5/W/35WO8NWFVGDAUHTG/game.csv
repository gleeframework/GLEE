"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it brings to your company.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while allowing both of us to benefit from the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, I'm not comfortable dropping below $925,000 at this point. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a beneficial outcome for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",925000.0,Alice,5,
