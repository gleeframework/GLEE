"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe would be a valuable asset for your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Alice's perceived value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it brings to your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for improvement and it's worth exploring further negotiation. Bob can likely secure a price closer to $900,000, which is still a decent deal compared to John's price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while allowing both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, I'm not comfortable dropping below $925,000 at this point. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a beneficial outcome for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $900,000. It's a good deal compared to John's offer of $1,200,000, and there's a good chance that further negotiation might not yield much better results. Accepting the offer ensures a purchase at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing time with further negotiations."
