"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of getting a good deal.  We'll see how he responds and adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to our minimum, it's still below our target.  We have more rounds and can try to get a higher price.  Let's see if we can push for a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $950,000?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $920,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're still within range of our minimum, and we have a few rounds left.  Let's see if we can push for $950,000 again.  If Bob won't budge, we'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $950,000 is the lowest I can go. This product is worth a lot more to me, but I'm trying to be fair.  Let's close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're close to our minimum and still have a few rounds left.  Let's try to push for $950,000 again. We can also start to consider selling to John in the next round if Bob doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still the best I can do.  This product is extremely valuable to me, but I'm making a real effort to work with you.  Let's close this deal.  I'm not sure I can go lower, but I'm willing to stay open to your ideas."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable to you, but I'm still on a tight budget. How about we meet at $915,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below our minimum.  While we could continue to negotiate, we only have two rounds left.  It's likely we won't reach an agreeable price with Bob, and selling to John guarantees us our minimum and secures a higher profit."
