"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to start with a price of $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There are 9 more rounds, and there's a chance Alice might lower her price to get a deal done."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $9,250 is better than her initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate further. He's already gotten Alice to lower the price significantly.  There are still several rounds left, so Bob has room to try to get a price closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,250 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering our previous discussions."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you at $10000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is the same as her initial offer in Round 1. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and has gotten Alice to lower her price before.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating.  There are still five rounds remaining, and Bob can use that time to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still hoping to get a better price than $10,000. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10750. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000. It's also higher than the price he's willing to pay from John. There are still 3 rounds left, and Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better deal. There's a chance that Alice might lower her price further to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000 and even higher than what John is willing to sell for.  This is the last round of negotiation, and with only one round left, Bob has little chance of convincing Alice to lower her price further. Therefore, it's best for Bob to buy from John for $12,000.  He's guaranteed a purchase at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
