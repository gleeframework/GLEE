"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it hard to find a better price elsewhere. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit off. Would you be open to $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
