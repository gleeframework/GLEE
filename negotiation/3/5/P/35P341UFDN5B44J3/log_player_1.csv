Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to me, so I'm asking for $1,200,000.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I have several rounds left and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,000,000?  That's a significant drop from my initial offer and a good starting point for us to work with."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement before the rounds run out.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing that."
