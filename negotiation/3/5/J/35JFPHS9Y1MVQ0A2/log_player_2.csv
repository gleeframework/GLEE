"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I value the product at $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $8,000. 
* Alice is offering it for $10,000.
* You can get the same product from John for $8,000.

Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
