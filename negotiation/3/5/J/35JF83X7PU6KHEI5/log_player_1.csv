Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you know the product is valuable to Bob, you subtly reinforce its worth in his mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests a willingness to discuss the price, making Bob more likely to engage rather than immediately reject the offer. 

While there's a chance Bob might reject $10,000, it's a calculated risk.  You have a guaranteed $8,000 from John, so aiming higher initially maximizes your potential profit."
