# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to her ($900,000 vs. $800,000). 
* You have a backup option to buy from John for $1,000,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or stick with buying from John, saving you at least $100,000."
