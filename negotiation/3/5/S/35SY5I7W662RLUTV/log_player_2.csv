It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially with a significant price difference.  You can likely get a better deal than $900,000."

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not afraid to push for a better price."

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for a better price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $800,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm still aiming for a better price than her latest offer.  Hopefully, we can find a middle ground."
