"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, based on my budget constraints, I can only consider a price within the range of $950000 to $1000000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",980000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to reach a deal, $980000 falls short of what this product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This offer represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll receive.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
