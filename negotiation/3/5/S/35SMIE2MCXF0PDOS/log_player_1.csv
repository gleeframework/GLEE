"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to my target, but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will find this price appealing since it's still significantly less than the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept.  $135 is still a good deal for me, and I believe Bob will be more inclined to agree to a price in the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is not budging from $130. It seems like he's firm on this price. While I prefer to get closer to $140, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting his offer at $130 is the best option at this point."
