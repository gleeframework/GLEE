"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product. Alice's offer is exactly $15,000, which means you won't save any money by buying from her. Since you have another option to buy from John for the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer."
