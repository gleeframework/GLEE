Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.
